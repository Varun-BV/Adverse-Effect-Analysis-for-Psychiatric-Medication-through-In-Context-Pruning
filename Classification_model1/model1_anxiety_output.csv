"Ive been on paxil for anxiety ~9 years, ever since i was diagnosed with anxiety disorders, i was ten. i am in the process of weaning myself off about 5mg at a time from the original 20. my withdrawals are awful, and i feel like im making a mistake, but i also feel like i was medicated too young and now that im an adult i need to be able to manage my disorders without medication.

No serious tag -- Social experiment,1
"Hi friends!  For quite some time now, I've had the sneaking suspicion that I'm clinically depressed.  I'll spare you the personal details you've heard a thousand times before and assume you'll trust my self diagnosis while we cut right to the chase.

The idea of me taking an antidepressant has always felt like using cheat codes on the hard levels of life to me.  However, that spiritually tough-guy approach is sounding more and more naive as the days roll on.  Exercise, fulfilling hobbies, and all the other general shenanigans that are suggested for natural happiness have still left me with an impending rain cloud floating over my head, thus leading me to believe that my brain might indeed have some faulty wiring.  So while considering exploring the world of doctor prescribed drugs, I've got a few questions for all you sad little beans out there that have been helped with the magic of pharmaceuticals:

1.) For those of you that have tried every happy drug under the sun, what's the primary difference between various antidepressants?  Are they as different as black and white, or just various shades of grey?  What made you settle with the drug you did?

2.) Anything from the family of Codeine makes me feel predictably perfect.  I'm completely aware of the absurdity of this statement and the narcotic relations of this drug, but nonetheless, I can not deny the level of peace this drug gives me when consumed.  I'm bubbling with creativity, talkative, outgoing, hard working, positive, etc.  Are there any legal antidepressants that tap into the same neuro-thingies as the opium family?

3.) My greatest fear is losing what little soul I have left should I consume an antidepressant.  Is this a justified fear?  Will I become an autonomous lemming after popping a paxil, or am I blowing these drugs out of proportion?

4.) I can't help the feeling that drug companies are more interested in a cut of my paycheck rather than my mental well being.  How do you justify trusting your mind and body to the share holders of Pfizer? What advice would you otherwise give to shut my tinfoil-hat dumb ass up?

5.) Bonus science question!  What do you think the evolutionary purpose of depression is?  I vaguely recall reading a study a while back that suggested it was a mechanism for humans to demand a greater level of attention among peers for one reason or another.  Why do you think we sometimes become perpetually sad?",1
"Shes just recently began taking Paxil, an anti depressant drug. they have been going through a rough patch  I think my dad has it  in his head that they are trying to work things out....   but he doesn't know that she cheated on him. what if they really are tying to work things out? I would ruin that by telling him. but I feel like its wrong not telling him.. I'm 17, I don't have a right or wrong answer for this. this is my first askreddit post. thanks for the help guys.   TL;DR my mom cheated and i don't know rather to tell my dad or not. ",1
"I am a 28 single male that suffers from severe depression. I am currently unemployed and do not have health insurance.

I have tried a exhaustive amount of treatments without any permanent success and am quickly running out of hope that I'll be able to get past this.

I don't know what to do or where to go for help.

"Where to start.....
im 18 years old.... in high school... i graduate high school in june....
At this point im convinced i have no future....
I suffer from severe anxiety disorder and depression, ontop of that i cannot concentrate in or outside of school, so when it comes to studying for tests or finals im quite hopeless. Ive been a guinea pig of canadas medical system.... ive been on more drugs than i could ever count.... zoloft, prozax, celexa, cymbalta, paxil, seroquel, ativan, klonopin, biphentin, dexadrine, stratera, and gabapentin. In the past year ive turned to alcohol, marijuana, ketamine, oxycodone, vicodin, tylenol#3 and even tylenol muscle pain....  currently i take stratera, clonazepam, and gabapentin, and ive also been smoking alot of weed. at this point i dont know whats really wrong with me... nothing seems to be really working.... i still can barely focus at school... im nearly failing everything.... so every major university is out of the question. I spent 3 weeks in a psychiatric unit this past summer and that was supposed to be the point where things in my life started to improve... but its far from it..... Im dependent on benzodiazapines to function throughout the day.... and i depend on marijuana to get to sleep at night.....  my parents are against marijuana 100% and i have been caught in the past and it hasnt gone over well... but i feel like its all i have.... Lately ive been so depressed i find no enjoyment in anything i like to do.... or used to.  in the past while ive contemplated suicide... ( which i dont have the guts to actually follow through with) ive been careless with drug and alcohol use.... ive been mixing benzo's with alcohol quite often.... 
  My family is being torn apart... my dad, brother and I are fed up with my moms selfishness... and my dad has said numerous time he is at his end and is ready to walk out.... which obviously hasnt been easy to hear or even think about..... 
My friendships are also disintegrating into what is seemingly meaningless.... i have almost no one to talk to.... Every romantic relationship ive ever had has failed and it seems to be worse and worse every time... which obviously in my case prompts more substance abuse....  I often ask myself why i need to get high every night or wasted.... and i really dont know.... i have 2 counsellors at the moment and a psychiatrist i work with... and nothing has improved.... they say it gets better but im running out of hope... as of last night ive made an attempt to quit smoking weed, and as an alternative to sleep at night i went and bought an over the counter sleep aid of some sort.  right now without marijuana everything seems dull and boring.... it was the one thing i had that was dependable to be a good part of my day.... something to look forward to every day.... im trying to quit because it is quite costly, and there is always a risk of getting caught that is not worth it at all.... 

now to the question.... What do i do reddit... where do i go for help... nothing has seemed to work.... i want a good future.... but i dont know if its within my reach....  I am new to reddit, so i do apologize for any mistakes or misunderstandings...

And if you see this as some sort of attention grab or bullshit story or whatever you may think....its really not... im just so done with everything.... i just feel completely hopeless, i made this post out of desperation to get others opinions and stories, and so that others who may be dealing with similar issues can potentially take something positive from this, im too tired to re read this.... i think ive covered just about everything... if you have any additional questions ill do my best to answer them, or if you want me to elaborate on something even ill try and do that too.....if parts of this post dont seem to make sense or go off track its just an indication of my state of mind and feelings right now.....





 TL;Dr im anxious, very depressed, use lots of drugs, and feel completely hopeless and only see a dark future for myself.... my family and friendships are falling apart.... and i cant deal with it anymore.... i need some advice....",1
Everyone around me seems to be so quick to say it'll mess me up and turn me into a zombie surely someone is benefiting right? ,1
"I am curious about stories because one time my aunt was on Paxil when I was a kid and I remember one time my baby nephew wouldn't stop crying, and she was holding him just staring into space smiling. It took my uncle and dad violently shaking her and taking my nephew out of here arms for her to come around. We had her pulled off that right away.

I have just recently been prescribed Paxil myself and I feel like I need to prepare to lose touch with myself.",1
"I'm 29 years old and back in my early 20's a doctor told me I have something called dysthimia, a kind of minor depression.  After being diagnosed, it's been easier for me to talk with close friends and family about what it's like having symptoms of depression, and also why I feel the need to take an expensive pill every day for it and the anxiety which comes along with it.

After talking to some friends, the ones around my age, I started to find that almost *all* of them had experience with seeing a doctor about feelings of depression.  Even at the time I talked to some of them, they were on Zoloft, Lexapro, Paxil, or others.

So, years after these revelations and after becoming more comfortable with my anxiety and myself, I started doing this thing - when I'd force myself to go house parties or out to the bars wth friends, I'd ask these drunk people there, the ones I figured I would never see again, about depression and anxiety and whatever.  Doing my best not to creep them out by talking about emotional shit with someone you just met, I found most of the young adults were pretty open and willing to talk about it (the beer couldn't have hurt, either).  And they *did* talk about it - so many of these 20-somethings described the exact sort of things I had felt, before I even had a chance to talk about it.

What I'm getting at with this letter is that even though statistics clearly show a big jump in SSRI usage in recent years, I still feel like it's going undiagnosed in a big way.  Despite the people I have talked about this with, there are friends I have who I know would benefit from all this but would be unlikely to even discuss actually going to a doctor.  Not to mention, it's still ""weird"" to just openly discuss mental problems a lot of the time.  I had to specifically pick my occasions, with either close friends or drunk strangers.

I feel like there's a fog settled upon most of us - a sad and confusing fog.  One that's largely being treated, but one that's also largely being ignored.  My question is if anyone else within my age group has noticed this?  Or if I'm just being dramatic?  I mean, I feel like I'm at the point where I think anti-depressant medication should be forced upon us the same way Tetanus shots are.  I feel this is such a widespread epidemic, and for the most part we have no idea how widespread it really is.  It's still even slightly taboo to just bring it up.  I feel like it's the zombie apocalypse going unnoticed right in front of our eyes.  That sounds silly, but I mean it in a serious way.  I don't think the depression problem will be the death of us, but rather it's a bizarre and unique situation which needs to be publicly addressed in a big way.

And for people with no personal experience with depression - have you noticed an alarming amount of people around you might be candidates for anti-depressants?  Or perhaps do you feel this whole depression situation is being blown out of proportion?

Btw, to explain the title, I'm not implying people over 35 don't get depression, but rather I'm not personally familiar with as many people from that age group as far as this concerns.  Same goes for why I specified American young adults.",1
"Just watching the news and saw GlaxoSmithKline was fined $3 billion for a number of illegal activities such as targeting Paxil for children's use when their studies showed it didn't work in children, not disclosing potential heart problems associated with Avandia (in which people actually died). I'm not sure about this case, but in most of these types of cases it actually pays for the corporation to break the law even with large fines. ",1
"I was diagnosed with GAD when I was 17 & I am now 28. I've taken Paxil, Remeron, Zoloft, and most recently Prozac, for my anxiety. I have been off meds for around 4 months and my anxiety is starting to creep back up on me, but I am tired of taking these every day. I feel like it puts me in a fog and I don't seem to care about things that were important to me in the past. I have been doing some research and found 5-HTP to be a supplement that increases serotonin levels, but shouldn't put me into that drug haze. So, my question is has anyone used this for anxiety? I really want to pick some up and give it a try if it's worth it! What were your side effects and how much did you take daily.... I want the whole story! Thanks in advance. ",1

"my bf really needed to stop altogether. i was more moderate but still more than what’s healthy. he wanted to stop so i said let’s do it together. it was hard for him, pretty easy for me. i’ll have an occasional cocktail out or wine at a get together but most weeks and months i don’t drink. 

i started using that time before bed to develop a skincare routine that i would have never stuck to drinking at night. it’s a little ritual and it makes me feel fancy and idk, i just don’t miss drinking",1
"A close friend of mine who wasn’t an alcoholic like my mom, more of an excessive partier, quit and was able to maintain social life and his happiness.  I got into a fist fight with my cousin at my wedding shower at a $3M home.  Open bar.  Those two things help me stop over six months I’ve trying. Since then, it’s been six years, it’s the best thing I ever did. Killed my mom killed my stepbrother, plagues, my brother plagued my grandfather.  After 60 days without a drink it was easy.  I’ve struggled with other devices and definitely over indulge on weed.  But take alcohol out of it made everything a little more simple, and it is such a blessing I’ve never experienced being under the influence around my kids",1

"I cut way back when I realized, I didn't need it to have fun and really just felt the pressure of doing as others did. I didn't want to waste money on overpriced drinks nor time on hangovers anymore. I don't drink at all now thanks to getting older and having a headache the next day even after just one drink.

edit: also after hearing the latest research that one glass of red wine is good for you is a myth and any amount of alcohol is poisonous to your body",1
"Woooo this is it man, I’d much rather wake up knowing that:
1. I am well rested

4. I will not be guilty or be anxious all weekend",1
"This is why I stopped… not even 9 days in the hospital for pancreatis… though that did stop me for a few months but when I started picking it up again I decided I’m not doing this to myself again 
I was tired of every day being dictated by drinking and I was either going to kill myself from drinking or just stop drinking completely.. in glad I chose the latter",1
Hmm might need something like like this! Im very visual,1
"Same with me and Effexor (SNRI). It also made my tolerance get very weird, like I don’t feel myself getting drunk before it’s too late and suddenly I feel terrible. Usually I only drink 2-3 beers at most, but I still hate the fact that I feel like this urge to do this almost every night, and it definitely wasn’t there before. And whenever I reduce my dosage, I suddenly don’t need to drink for a really long time. Suck to pick between panic attacks and my liver",1
Duloxetine makes me want to binge drink hard. I have to be very careful and go in with a limit in my head or I can end up drinking 8-10 beers in a matter of 3 or 4 hours.,1
"Have you heard about somatic experiencing? I had a similar experience with anxiety/panic, an Ssri and alcohol several years back. After getting off the medication I kind of just “gave up” probably due to depression of the situation and the panic subsided for 7-8 years. 

This year the panic came back due to stress and I didn’t want to approach the issue with medication again. I found a therapist that uses a variety of techniques and they have proven to be amazing. Look into somatic experiencing",1
"unfortunately cannabis makes me paranoid unless on benzos and I get a real hard urge to drink when on benzos, although I didn't drink today which makes me proud",1

People just want some relief. It's such a shame it's seen in the way it is,1

That’s just replacing one coping mechanism for another,1
Where would I start for cannabis if I know nothing and I drink a lot,1
"Same boat. I gave up alcohol bc of the flares, that shit haunt me forever",1
I'm glad to read about how you found the strength to change,1
try limiting your drinking to once a month in the new year. it was lovely for me,1
"Yes, I'd have to plan any errands which required driving to before I started drinking for safety.  Now that I limit my drinking more, I have more windows of opportunity to do errands.  So it's not as restrictive.  It's a sense of freedom",1
social anxiety can trigger the need to poop too,1
What’s GERD,1
"My friend always called it the DADS: day after drinking shits

The best part of not drinking for fucking real",1
Where would I start for cannabis if I know nothing and I drink a lot,1
My understanding from someone who took it is that is basically eliminates the craving to get drunk. You can have a beer or two but I think it’s mostly for binge drinkers,1
I usually forget my drink is there. I’m down to like 2 drinks a week except for Eagles games. I’ll have 2-3 that day,1
"In a word, heartburn",1
"It was right place, right time for me.  However, I’ve learned that most high school systems are starving for coaches so you could probably find an assistant (either volunteer or paid) position pretty easily.  

For reference, the high school I coach for has 1700 students and the head coach’s stipend is $3,000 for the season ($3k for girls/$3k for boys; most head coaches hold both positions) and the assistants make $1,500.

Additionally, you can get certified by USA Track and Field as a Level 1 Coach by completing their online certification course (it’s easy).

"I have never experienced anxiety and had internal shakiness so badly in the morning that I felt nauseated and headachy.  I thought it was withdrawal from Wedllbutrin.  It was like I had some drug given to me.  I had intrusive thoughts for weeks in addition.  I’m told this was the definition of anxiety.  I alwasy thought it felt like fear or nervousness never did I think this was anxiety.,  It’s terrible and I do NOT want a BENZO.  I used Paxil nearly 30 years ago for depression without anxiety.  I could say it saved my life and that it was very calming at the time.  I’m 56 now and never had a more miserable effect than i do now after discontinuing the Wellbutrin after only taking it for 4 weeks. I never had the anxiety until i was put on it for  FOCUS.  Now I’ve left with a horrible left of anxiety hoping and praying the Paxil will help and SOON.  I go to bed each night hopeful I will wake up myself again… this morning, after only one dose, the intrusive thoughts were nearly present but the shakiness thorughout my body was causing some nausea. I push through that with some food and light exercise and it subsides.  Do you recall how long you took it before you saw a glimmer of hope?",1

So I’m a hypochondriac which makes it bad enough. I’m absolutely mortified of dying and I’ve been taking Paxil to help me with this.

I feel the usual withdrawal symptoms and I just finally got a refill on my prescription. I did some research on Paxil withdrawal and I’m genuinely mortified. Everyone is saying it’s dangerous to go cold Turkey. I even read that someone picked up a guy who was having a seizure from his withdrawals. I don’t plan on quitting cold Turkey but even to taper off??? People are saying it’s horrible. I’m so so so afraid of dying as it is and I was never warned about this when I was initially put on Paxil. I’m angry and frustrated and scared. I don’t want to be on Paxil anymore but I don’t want to fucking die? Like I’m genuinely mortified. Any suggestions? Do you guys think I’ll die or have a seizure from quitting Paxil? This is gonna send me down a spiral I can feel it.,1
"I started on Ativan and Paxil when I was 14 for panic and anxiety, and I'm now 36.

 Back when  I started the meds, my dad would yank me on and off of them. I was only on 10 mg Paxil at first even though the psychiatrist wanted me to be on 20 mg but my dad didn't want me to. When I went off to a summer camp being on my own for the first time in my life, I was so anxious the first night I took 20 mg Paxil and did for the rest of the three weeks I was there. I did the best I had in my life. When I left, my dad took me off the Paxil abruptly all at once. This was probably in 1999 I think and before I or I think anyone else knew about the discontinuation syndrome. I had the most awful symptoms, particularly the brain zaps and my vision shifting. My anxiety was so bad with my family. Right after that  summer camp we flew across the country and traveled up and down the west coast visiting different relatives, and I was in hell--having what I now know was Paxil withdrawal and also severe anxiety.

When I started 12th grade that summer, my anxiety was so out of control compared to 11th grade that I went back on the Paxil eventually back up to 20 mg. But it never worked the same to control my anxiety again. That was the fall of 2000.

I barely made it through the end of high school. At the end of that year, my dad again took me off the Paxil. He had the idea that I should only be taking the meds when I was in school.

I went off to college the next fall, and the Student Health Center couldn't believe that my dad was the one deciding which psych meds I was on. They wouldn't see me until I agreed to see the school psychiatrist who was not great. He put me on Celexa, Klonopin, and Ativan.

I deteriorated badly.

I had to drop out of college by Fall 2002, at which point I was put on 30 mg of Paxil (as well as the Ativan).

For a long time on the Paxil I had the typical symptoms of anorgasmia. But something changed taking it for so many years (up until now) where I actually had the opposite reaction: very premature orgasm (near immediate) in spite of continuing to be on the Paxil.

My psychiatrist didn't like Paxil and lowered the dose from 30 to 20 mg.  


What I found very strange was that I had no brain zaps at all in making that decrease. In fact, I got very sleepy and relaxed going from 30 to 20 mg of Paxil.

That was several years ago, and my OCD since that got much worse. I stopped seeing that psychiatrist recently (long story) and am seeing a new one who wants to increase the Paxil dose for my out of control OCD.

She wanted to start slowly and increase only to 25 mg.

I have only been up to 25 mg for 5 days, but I feel like I've had way more energy, and tonight in particular have had way too much energy (like a pressure in the head expanding and trouble focusing because energy feels too high plus a headache), and I've found myself having increase libido (I normally have none at all), and if anything my OCD symptoms have been worse.

I feel like the only time Paxil truly worked for me was when I first went on it at 10 mg and I could feel it sort of ""blocking"" anxious thoughts, and then when I went up on it to 20 mg at the summer camp.

But I wonder if my brain is sort of ""fried"" from having gone off it abruptly twice in the past. I've always wondered if those discontinuations caused some sort of damage that makes me respond strangely to Paxil nw.

I always found it very suspicious that I had no withdrawal symptoms going from 30 to 20 mg and instead felt so sleepy and relaxed (and my blood pressure decreased greatly). And now going up just 5 mg really seems to be revving me up.

I know the dose for adequately treating OCD is at least 40 mg, and before I had been on 30 mg without feeling revved up like this, but I just wonder if my responses will be abnormal due to how I was yanked on and off the drug so abruptly before. It doesn't seem like my responses are normal to it.",1
"Hello, everyone.

My name is Maria and I'm 31 years old. 

Last year, I came off of Paxil after being on it for 13 years. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety (as well as ADHD) when I was 17 years old.

At first, Paxil worked WONDERFULLY for me. Over the years, however, my depression/anxiety waxed and waned, and I wasn't really sure the Paxil was effective for me anymore. As a matter of fact, looking back, the psychiatrist who originally prescribed them to me didn't REALLY do what I would consider to be a very good or thorough psychological analysis of me... and I was wondering if I should have ever been on Paxil in the first place. I was also experiencing some side effects that I wasn't happy with. 

I tried to come off of it SEVERAL times, and it was always an absolute DISASTER. I tried quitting cold turkey, against advice, that was a huge mistake. I tried weaning myself over the course of weeks - even MONTHS. There was NOTHING I could do that didn't result in severe emotional and physical symptoms. I felt physically ill, I had hallucinations, nightmares. I even had the terrible ""brain zaps"" they talk about. It was a BEAST to come off of and I always ended up going back to it because I felt like I was losing my mind and I just could NOT feel better. 

Well, finally, last year, I powered through it and feel like I really risked my relationship with my boyfriend, bless his heart. Things were really, really rough for SEVERAL months. I was struggling at home, I was struggling at work... it was just really bad. But I was determined to get off of it to see if, in the end, I really needed it. 

I finally got off of it and I feel pretty confidently that I DO need SOMETHING to assist me with my depression and anxiety - because they're still here. They are, unfortunately, very much alive and well. But I'm TERRIFIED of taking another antidepressant because so many of them have reputations for withdrawal/discontinuation symptoms - or serious side effects. I am EXTREMELY sensitive to medication and can't even take a singular Benadryl without feeling totally hungover and disconnected the next day.

Well, I saw a new psychiatrist and told him about my experience with Paxil and how I had recently come off of it after so many trials and so many errors, and he totally minimized it. He looked at me like I had 3 heads when I told him how difficult it was to come off of it and how it made my life extremely hard for MONTHS. I was to the point where I thought I was either going to have to quit my job or they were going to fire me. I just couldn't function. He basically glossed over it like I had just said ""I just didn't feel well for a day or so"" and tried to prescribe me Prozac, which also has been known to have discontinuation issues. Not to mention he also tried to convince me to buy hundreds of dollars worth of supplements that he swore would help me. I told him I didn't have room in my budget for such a hefty amount of vitamins and supplements and he suggested that I work more.

Can you believe this?

I was barely making it through my regular work week with my anxiety and depression and with the recent discontinuation of the Paxil, I TOLD him this, and he said I needed to consider working more.

I was flabbergasted. And so offended.

So I tried a NEW psychiatrist.

And guess what?

Exactly the same thing.

She prescribed me Prozac almost immediately once I told her my story, even when I specifically asked her if there were any other options. And again, she completely disregarded everything I said. She was like ""you probably just didn't wean yourself good enough."" And acted like my symptoms lasted for a day, not 3 straight, whole months. 

I almost lost it.

I had struggled for SO. LONG. 

My life was a living hell and my family was ready to check me into a hospital.

On TOP of this, the second psychiatrist said, upon meeting her,  that she and the rest of her office only dealt with medicine management. But their website specifically says they provide psychotherapy and tests/assessments. I really wanted psychotherapy as WELL as assistance with finding the right medication - AND to have new tests and/assessments done. Because maybe my problem is deeper. Maybe I have bipolar or borderline personality. Because my issues are significant and make my life and relationships very, very difficult. So I feel misled AND like I've just been given a prescription to shut me up.

What is going on here? 

I feel so disgusted and defeated and like I'm being totally gaslighted (gaslit?) by professionals who are supposed to be helping me.

Has anyone else had this experience? Whether it be with severe drug discontinuation issues or with pushy psychiatrists who don't listen to anything you say?

"Hi, I needed some advice from people, or just some nice experiences from others.
Back story;
I was on Zoloft from when I was in 8th grade, up until this past March. (I was 18 in march, turned 19 in July for an idea on age) 
I was doing okay on Zoloft, obviously I can’t remember what it was like in the beginning. 
I got off in march because I wanted to go without meds. I was up at 150mg for about a year or 2. 
When I got off them, I felt weird the first month or 2 but then kinda felt somewhat normal again. This past August my mom thought I should get back on them, so I agreed and made an appointment with my past dr.
This doctor told me it should be fine to start me at 100mg.. after not being on it at all for 7 ish months, I thought it was weird, but didn’t question her. I got the meds, took the 100mg, and was doing HORRIBLE for a week or 2. I only took one dose of 100 and it screwed me up. After that, I got a new dr. I was so scared (and still am) to take any medication. After a month, I decided to try and get back on Zoloft for a second time. My new dr started me at 25, I took 2 doses, and had to stop. I was sweating bad, throwing up, shaky, couldn’t eat, etc. (ended up in the er panicking)
It’s been a little bit since then, but I’ve tried to go without meds and I just can’t.
I’m absolutely terrified of taking a med, and I wish I could go without being on something, but I don’t think that’s going to work for me in the long run.
I did a genetics test for antidepressants, and all of the ones in the first column (being the best ones for me) my doctor said were very strong, and didn’t want me to feel worried or anxious. So we went to the middle column (these being ones I can handle but they’re iffy)
The ones in the middle column were:
Zoloft, Prozac, lexapro, Paxil, Luvox, and Celexa.
Today, I went to my doctor, and she told me she wanted to prescribe me Prozac at 10mg. my mom takes it and says it works really well for her so I’m not overly worried. 
I’m just scared of side effects. I’m scared of feeling nauseated or feeling sick because if I feel any of those, I’ll get anxious based on what happened with my last doctor.
Any thoughts? Anyone have a good experience with it? ",1
"I grew up in a lower middle class immigrant home. My parents are toxic but still married. I always had everything I needed and little more. I have some trauma but I also know that others have it way worse. 

I recently decided to take a break from college because I physically can’t get myself to put in the effort to do it. I’ve retaken and failed so many courses and I feel like a failure. I’m also about to loose my job because of my careless/irresponsible mistakes. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, adhd (and possibly bipolar, still working on that with my doctors) about 1.5 years ago and I’ve been on a mental health journey ever since (really I’v been battling with my brain my whole life). Ever since my diagnosis I’ve been on adderall, Paxil, and buspar but I feel like they only do so much. I also went to therapy for a little over a year but I stopped because I felt like it wasn’t helping me either. My therapist and I would talk about my day to day problems and occasionally the “deeper” issues. She would advise me to mediate, set alarms, and yoga which are all great and helpful but I’m starting to feel like it’s not enough. I’ve tried other forms of therapy like solo trips, reading books, exercising, and art but the “good feelings” never last long. My brother recently tried ayahuasca and he said it was great for his mental health. He’s been trying to convince me try it but I also have an addictive personality and if I put myself in certain environments (physically or mentally) I abuse drugs/alcohol. I’m also afraid that it wont work and I’ll just waist my time and money. I’ve taken a physiological exam (mmpi) and it came back inconclusive (which was so disappointing). I really thought that my issues were purely adhd and depression but now that I’ve tried several things to try to resolve it I’m loosing hope. Sometimes I feel like I’m too self-aware…. or maybe I’m just crazy. Im also extremely sensitive and stubborn and I hate asking for help. I just want to get to the bottom of my issues and figure out why I’m so depressed. I don’t want to feel this way anymore. Actually I don’t want to feel at all. I feel like a burden. I just want to love my life. What is my purpose. What is the value of life? Who am I? What do I do? Why do I hate myself so much? I want to feel okay, I want to feel normal.

"to start off, i'm 28f and live with my two parents, and my younger brother. 

mental health issues run in my family: i have GAD, my mom has depression. my dad never seemed to struggle with anything except in the last couple of years. we've never had the best relationship; he's always isolated himself in the basement being on his computer (on reddit, watching youtube videos, listening to music, etc). him and my mom don't have the best relationship either, they used to argue all the time when i was growing up but i guess as they got older they couldn't be bothered anymore, they're too tired of it. but only in the last couple of years did i notice the isolation getting worse: he used to at least at dinner with us but now he doesn't, and he barely eats anything. he doesn't come to family gatherings (birthdays or other events), he doesn't even see his own sister anymore (my aunt had a falling out with our family, that may have contributed to his depression/anxiety). 

he went to the doctors just a few months ago to do something about it, after some pushing from me and my mom. he started on SSRIs (lexapro) but then he switched medications because he said it was making him worse. he started paxil now with wellbutrin. i don't notice any significant differences in him and he looks/acts the same. he's still isolating himself and he barely talks to anyone, when he talks to me or my mom he looks down or around, not at us directly, and is kind of like shakey and jittery. 

i think that there's a bunch of issues that have caused his mental health to deteriorate in the last couple of years: his relationship breakdown with his sister, relationship breakdown with my mom (but they still live in the same house), and the fact that we had  to move recently due to our previous landlord selling our house that we rented at the last 25 years. occasionally i check in to ask how he's doing and if the medication is working but he looks and acts the same. he doesn't see a therapist and i doubt he would be comfortable doing that but i'm not 100%. i'm used to talking with my mom about her problems because she's always been an open book and tells me everything (maybe to my detriment)... but with my dad it's hard to know how he feels bc he doesn't open up about his feelings, maybe bc he doesn't want to burden anybody.

TLDR: my dad's depression/anxiety has gotten worse in the last few years/months and doesn't seem to be getting better with medication. anybody else going through something similar with a parent? how can i help?",1
"I truly feel like i have no one to talk to. I'm a 17yo Canadian male, and my experience with the mental health system has been abysmal. I began to show symptoms of depression at the age of 12, and since then i have taken countless prescribed drugs from Prozac to Paxil, been in and out of mental health programs that left me more fucked up coming out then going in, and lost all trust in the industry and my fellow human beings.

I would not still be alive without my parents, specifically my mother, who has been the lynch pin to my will to live countless times, and that has put stress on her magnitudes greater then i could ever ask such a wonderful woman to bare. over the years i have struggled to keep my head together, and often that meant nothing more then appearances that are a facade to the shambles that i am in emotionally at one time or another.

I know now that i have adhd, something that my older sister saw clearer then the professionals that were apparently experts in the field, and now i have a working prescription of three pills in the morning, and two at night, to obtain some bare minimum of function. my utter mistrust in the Canadian psychiatric system was born from repeated violations of my faith, and punishment in response to openness. I have been held against my will in isolation in hospital mental health wings more then once, and been told repeatedly that the failure of my mental health improving is a fault of my own.

I had to look into my fathers eyes as i was escorted out of a therapy appointment in handcuffs by two armed officers, and placed in the back of a police car, all because i told my therapist that i had experienced suicidal thoughts a full week ago, and in the subsequent call from her to my physiatrist apparently the latter decided that i needed to be put on a form one against my will. I spent 36 hours alone in a white room the size of a broom closet listening to the muffled screams of the truly mentally disturbed as i waited to see a doctor at the wing of the hospital i was escorted to, i occupied myself by making a game out of the hospital wristband and an elastic. more then a day and a half after i was placed inside this room, the doctor assigned to assess new patients spent a grand total of four minutes with me before concluding that i was in no way a danger to myself or anyone else, at this moment in time, i was promptly released. I later learned that during this time my mother had no idea where i was, as she was being waved away by administrative, by all means to her it seemed as if i had vanished into thin air, without the ability to obtain any information from my therapist or physiatrist.

Before this incident i spent half a week in a hospital ward against my will after voluntarily checking in due to a massive emotional crisis, i quickly learned that this place was nothing more then a prison designed specifically to prevent suicide, and i spent most of my time in isolation within the room i was assigned to, only being allowed out to eat. I should note that i was eating the food of other absent patients, as they had no actual food for me, instead i subsisted off leftovers, which is great for feelings of self-worth.

the only other program i ever voluntarily entered as an effort to overcome my challenges was CAPIS, my time in the program was spent attempting to relate to my other peers, who were all drug addicts, and participating in the inane time-wasting games facilitated by staff. I was eventually isolated from the other patients socially due to a spreading rumor that i was a snitch in regards to their activities during the allowed ""recess"", that being shoplifting and smoking pot. Not that it really matters, but i will  say that i did not in fact ever tell staff, instead the rumor began with another boy who for one reason or another didn't like me.

My parents were called out of work to bring me into the hospital for a meeting, in which i was told that they had decided it would be best that i skipped this rotation of the program and started anew with another group, i told them i really didn't care what the other kids thought of me, i was only interested in the program itself and getting better. suffice to say they weren't expecting that, and the truth was forced out of them that they had already made the decision, and i was kicked out because my continued presence would make the gossiping junkies uncomfortable. My parents were brought out of work to be TOLD that i was leaving the program, something that could have happened in an email.

The reason i have written out this short novella about my affairs with the incompetence of the mental health system is that when i say i have no one to talk to, i mean it. i have no ounce of trust left in my being to bare my soul to any therapist or physiatrist or other jackass who has a certificate saying they understand the deeper workings of the human mind. i have few friends, and those that i do have are distant, and i don't talk to them regularly.

To open up to my parents would be to fail them, as much as they want to help, and i'm sure if they knew my underlying struggles they'd would want me to share. unfortunately i feel i have hurt them to much, they have done so much for me and to make them pay for the failings of the system would be despicable. they have shed to many tears for me.

I am suffering from a lack of social contact as a product of the trust issues i have developed, i fear i am nothing more then a callus of emotional scaring, I'm starving to be truly known, but i trust no one to know me.",1

"Dizziness started in mid November 2021, went to Canberra on the 10th of December and I had my first near faint experience followed by high heart beat and palpitation. 

Dizziness and lightheaded was followed till the 28th of December when I nearly fainted again and had really high heart rate: went to hospital. They did blood work and ecg couldn’t find a probable cause. Went to hospital again 3 days later and no findings were evident. Upon my 3rd visit to hospital X-ray was done off my chest and nothing was found. I was bedridden for 6 weeks, everyday was a battle for life, I felt like I was in septic shock everyday. I had to get iv fluids about 10 times because of dehydration, I sweated constantly with no appetite for water or food.

Symptoms 

Lightheaded 
Dizziness
Heart gets tired quickly 
Sometimes my arms and hands become a little numb.
My head feels tension.
heat in my abdomen, back and my ears get hot.
Feels like a pulsating feeling through my body during a bad episode 
Sometimes left shoulder feels warm
My eyes sometimes drop tears randomly
Unable to concentrate at times
Shortness of breath during episode 
There’s always a tense feeling in my chest and around my heart area. Sometimes hits my lower abdomen and I feel nausea makes my stomach make noises. I have difficulty sleeping my head spins more when I close my eyes. I wake up between 1-3am with a weird feeling as if I’m scared or something. Vision sometimes becomes blurry. Fatigue and tiredness. Little sudden Noises scare me. Whenever I have a episode that peaks, my hands and feet get sweaty and I feel heat. My hands and feet sometimes get cold. The feeling in my mid left chest area I can’t explain but it’s as if my muscles are vibrating. When I stand up it’s seems my head and chest symptoms get worse for about a minute and then settle down. Same thing happens when I lay down. It gets worse for a minute till it goes back to how it was. Sometimes I can feel it hitting my front part of my head and my sinus feels tense as well. As well as my ears feel the pressure. Lying down seems to reduce some tension in my head. I feel bad 80% of the day really bad 15% of the day and alright 5% of the day.


Let’s go back to my childhood, my earliest memory is probably when I was around 10. If I would focus on my breathing it felt like I couldn’t breath anymore. I also had these unexplained spinning and dizziness at a young age during sleep time. Doctors couldn’t find anything. I was always a scared kid thinking about the worse case scenario that might kill me but in reality it was overthinking. In highschool a few times I nearly fainted out of the blue. Sometimes during sports I’ll hit a point where out of no where my heart would start racing and my breathing would become laboured. Sometimes over excitement caused this as well.

Now medications 

Lexapro 40mg for 6 months, no benefits. Made me really bad during the first 2 weeks and kinda of settled after that, dumbed the depressive symptoms but that’s about it. Felt much better after coming off, it definitely made my condition worse. Derealisation, fatigue, tiredness, forgetfulness. All of it.

Zoloft 50mg for 18 days and 100mg for 3 days, had a panic attack on day 3 I thought it was Zoloft but found it to be thc later on. Discontinued Zoloft then. No benefits during the 18 days on 50mg and made my condition way worse.

Paxil 20mg for 2 months, probably one of the strongest reactions to any ssri, daily panic attacks losing my mind, as if there’s a laughter in my head but it’s my internal monologue creating it but still I was losing it. Pushed on for 2 months and it just made me worse as the days went on.

Agomelatine 20mg no benefits, daily panic attacks, took it for about 36 days.

Pristiq, I’m on day 54 and I’ve stopped taking it, my last dose was on Wednesday not sure how to stop. It’s making me worse, mood is swinging, brain fog and all other symptoms are reappearing on this medication.

Clonidine didn’t do much except relax my body alittle

Lyrica, knocked me out at 25mg and made me tired. No benefits.

Valium 5mg, very small relief, short benefits 3-5 hours, more of a muscle relaxant, addictive in nature.

Clonezapam 1mg, small amount of relief, short relief 3-5 hours. 

Xanax 2mg, haven’t tried 

Ativan 1mg only have tried 0.5mg and it didn’t do much.

Seroquel 25mg, good for sleep, couldn’t sleep for more then 4 hours for the last 5 years or so, now I get a solid 8 hours, it’s not a 100% good quality sleep but it gets the job done, I don’t feel tired through the day as before I got sick.

Epilim haven’t tried chickenend out

Lamictal discontinued on day 3 after developing rash

Lithium 500mg, 37 days. Left like losing my mind not sure if adverse reaction to the lithium or it was some kind of discontinuation I was getting from the lexapro. 

Prozac 4 days to bridge off lexapro 

Thc/cbd oil, made me go full panic mode for 4 hours each time I tried it. Very similar to what I was feeling with the Paxil minus the laughter side effect.

My physical symptoms cycle throughout the weeks and I’m never symptomsless. Physical or cognitive I always feel something.

My mind always feels like as if something is off,

As my overall condition gets worse my brain fogs becomes really bad and my hands and feet become so cold to the touch, 

I become very forgetful

I can never stop thinking about my condition, my mind is occupied by it 24/7

When I’m on medications l as ssri’s I get irrational fears such as being allergic to nuts or something crazy. But seems to go away after a month when discontinuing  the medication,

Lightheaded, feel like my neck muscles are so tense that my brain isn’t getting enough blood.

I’m hyper focused on all bodily functions physical or Cognitive, if I suspect something that is schizophrenic or damaging I get a mini panic attack. But panic attack do occur for no reason as well most of the times.

I’ve done all the physical body checkups before the anxiety diagnosis. Everything check out well physically.",1
"Anyone who couldn’t take either because of side effects, if so what did you take instead for severe anxiety and depression",1
"I have genuinely attempted to receive help in my area and surrounding areas. I have done everything from every damn 1st line pill to taking benzos daily for months, the only thing that workd was benzos but we know those aren't prescribed long term and they are dangerous blahblahblah. I think me jumping off a building or swerving my car into a bridge is a little more dangerous but okay doc. 

I recently did Transcranial magnetic stimulation as a last ditch attempt to relieve some of my anxiety. It did nothing. More money flushed.

I have gotten on and off every standard pill people blab about. Trintellix, Rameron, LExapro, Zoloft, Prozac, Seroquel, Wellbutrin, Buspar, Effexor, Pristiq, Paxil, and more.

These serotogenic  type drugs only make me apathetic, chronically exhausted and dead inside. Not to mention weight gain and sexual dysfunction. There is no joy or relief of anxiety. I have taken Xanax, Klonopin with great success but those are never given more than a couple weeks due to addiction potential or whatever.

I just feel like the only things that work aren't available and anything that might help I've tried and have yet to get relief.

&#x200B;

Some would be very blessed to be in my position. I have a good job, good savings, nice car, nice house, beautiful fiancee who loves and cares about me but I am so stressed out, anxious and high key that I can't even go meet my fiancee's parents for breakfast. Then the stress of them wondering why, us having to always make an excuse makes me want to just off myself to save myself the shame and embarrassment. 

I sometimes just feel like I can't receive successful treatment and maybe I need to end myself so my fiancee and family can find someone who is less miserable and who can actually enjoy the things they have. I am just tired of trying to fight to survive and waking up miserable, irritated, panicky, shaky, rough..

For many years I was able to fight these thoughts but the last couple weeks the stress of upcoming marriage, lack of treatment options, has me really just not wanting to suffer anymore. I flew home 12 hours in a panic where I was passing in and out of consciousness and sweating so bad the flight attendant thought I spilled something on my clothes. My psych told me to take benadryl for the anxiety. I just feel like a fucking joke and am tired of suffering. 

&#x200B;

I have tried psychadelic retreats as well, then I even did 2 years completely substance free even cutting out caffeine and still felt miserable like this. My anxiety chokes me out, makes me feel like I am going to die any second, keeps me awake for days at a time, I just cant see myself pushing through this much longer anymore. I dream of dying. 

If I refuse to go inpatient somewhere, what are my options? Is there some new therapy or pill that I'm not aware of? I refuse to go back to standard talk therapy or CBT, it didn't work at all and only worsened me after 4 years of trying going sometimes once a week.",1
"Firstly, I want to apologize if this is going to be long and thank the ones who decided to take the time to red this.

I have to start at the beginning, I guess, so whomever decides to read this can understand what I'm asking/confirming whatever I gain the confidence and courage to type. Also, I'll try to keep this as short as possible without leaving major details out.

At the moment, I am at the age of 32 years, and I undenify as a male. When I was younger, when I was in elementary school, my mother decided to leave me and my younger brother while she went to the store real quick. She never came back. My father at the time was always away working in construction at some high-profile places (celebrities houses, big company sites ect ect). So he was gone 2 states away and wasn't due back for another week. We were found 3 days later when my grandparents hadn't heard anything from my mother. She went missing, and no one could find her, and she disappeared. Fast forward a few months, and she called my grandparents(her parents) and told them that she was in Mexico and wanted to come home. 

I was always taught that the man had to be big and strong and show no emotions or weakness at all, and I learned during all that time to bottle it all down and be strong. My grandfather's at the time were my father figures during that time because my mother was passing me and my brother off to them while she would go out and get high on whatever drugs she could get her hands on. Also, again, my father was away working to provide for me and my brother. It took me just a few years ago when I had my first major mental breakdown to realize that and understand it, or so I, myself, understand it.

My mother and father divorced, and we moved with my mother to many different places over the next couple of years, different states on the East Coast. Then eventually close enough to both of the grandparents. She found a  an abusive boyfriend and he decided to move in. I was in middle school going into high-school when she left me and my brother again, and disappeared again. Luckily I was old enough to realize what happened and called the grandparents to get us.

A couple of years went by, and my brother and I were living with my father. He still worked construction, but it was always closer to home now. I remember this day very vividly and it replays in my head quite often. I was in junior year of high school, English class when the teachers phone rings and he called me to come to the phone. It was my mother and she simply told me hi and that she wished me a happy birthday and hung up. I went to my desk and put my head down and truly cried and broke down at my desk. There was no way to find out where she called from or how she was able to get the number to the classroom at that time. 

Friends came and went, and the same went with the couple of girlfriends and one cheating on me for a really good friend at the time. After graduating high school, I decided to move up north with my father and work at my uncles company. My mother shows back up and says that she is a new person and a couple years go by and I decided to move back south where I eventually I met my now loving wife. We decided to get married after being together for two years. 

Fast forward 6 years later my one grandfather passed away while i was at the hospital bed and after that time is when I started having some disturbing thoughts and told my wife I didn't want to be with her anymore so she or so I thought in my head at that time would have to see what I was going through or that I had suicidal thoughts. I perfected the perfect mask at this point and told her it was because I didn't love her anymore and was cold to her but never put my hands on her as she rightfully threw stuff at me. 

6 months goes by and I have a reality check after one really bad drunk weekend. I never once touched drugs other than weed a couple of times because if I have to be honest, my mother scared the living shit out of me watching her do drugs and drink. I called my wife after I sobered up and apologized and really told her what was going on. During this time I started having really bad anxiety. I moved in with my wife and we honestly work on things and it honestly made our relationship stronger and stronger because I learned how to talk to her. I went to doctors because the anxiety was getting bad and was always what I would call it analyze mode where I would aways look around the room and see where everything is placed and different places I could leave the room and still do that to this day. He told me that I had anxiety and depression.

During the next couple of years I went through every depression and anxiety medication you can think of and if you would look in my closet, it looks like a pharmacy in there from all of them. I'm on paxil ( I think that it's spelled because by the time I reached here it is 6am and I started at 11pm last night.) and Buspar. There's some days that I feel great and then there's some days I just want to disappear and go live in the mountains some where and have the plans done all up and hidden if it ever came to that day. I do have the often suicidal thoughts but let me say this and make this clear I WILL NOT GO THROUGH WITH IT EVER. I made a promise to my wife that I would never do it. And she knows I have them because I tell her just about everything except for where those plans are.

My mother moved close to us.

We move in with grandmother to help her out 

Mother moves closer and is nearby all the time because of the grandmother drinks and so does my mother.

My anxiety gets way worse to where me and the wife have come to the conclusion I'm audio hallucinations where I think the dog is barking or doors slamming or someone saying my name. Nothing bad in the since but it has been becoming a very frequent thing. And I also have been seeing shadows just inside my sight range. 

The doctor told me I should go see a psychologicalist or whatever and I want to but I'm afraid. Not for the simple fact that I have to tell them this stuff but what their reaction to what is going on in my head. I don't want tobe put in some mental hospital or anything because of my thoughts that I have. 

But I do want to get better and enjoy my life with my wife but my head won't quiet down anymore.( AGAIN I WILL NOT GO THROUGH WITH THOSE THOUGHTS. ) I think of every thing that happens at any giving moment and I deal with it all day and night. I other think things, simple thing and sometimes I can think on it for days. I have recently noticed that I go in auto pilot mode for a few minutes and I don't remember what happens during that time. I hardly sleep now because of the medication because I love my sleep and miss my sleep soooooo very much. To be honest I hate people in general until I get to know someone then I become like them like I match up with what they like and pay attention to it to everything and watch this psychical movements. Not like any weirdo stuff or anything it's more to make sure they stay happy  and have fun around me.

I guess to end it all I guess I'm scared I want to seek help but scared of being trapped I guess you can say. I worried about everything and don't want to put my wife through that I really don't but I'm at the point I need to do something. I just need that courage push or whatever you make to get there but I always find a way to stop myself.

Am I honestly going crazy..? Is there something really wrong with me? And how do I stop finding ways to stop myself from making that next step for help?

Thank you for whomever decides to read this rant or whatever you call it anymore. I'm sorry that it was so long but this is the first time I've let it all out even though it's extremely cut down

Thank you again and hopefully I get some sleep because my head has finally calmed down enough from smoking weed to  maybe accomplish a couple hours of sleep

Good night all and I will check this often.",1

Currently my biggest challenges are

I think I’m developing schizophrenia all the time, and I’m going to lose my mind.

I’m hyper vigilant and see things in the corners of my eye.

My physical symptoms cycle throughout the weeks and I’m never symptomsless. Physical or cognitive I always feel something.

My mind always feels like as if something is off,

As my overall condition gets worse my brain fogs becomes really bad and my hands and feet become so cold to the touch, 

I become very forgetful

I can never stop thinking about my condition, my mind is occupied by it 24/7

When I go into crowded areas my physical symptoms become much worse, such as brain fog heart rate and jelly legs.

My internal monologue never shuts up and it’s always active.

Racing thoughts

When I’m on medications l as ssri’s I get irrational fears such as being allergic to nuts or something crazy. But seems to go away after a month when discontinuing  the medication,

Lightheaded, feel like my neck muscles are so tense that my brain isn’t getting enough blood.

"I don't know if this exactly qualifies as mental health persay, in that it's not only mental health as much as it is probably that and neurological issues/cognitive issues. So. I'm about to be alone for the first time in my life, at the ripe age of 25, and it's like I have no clear sense of self, no ideas spark into my mind, my executive functions, like working memory, planning, prioritizing, initiation, etc are all burned. I go through the day in a confused state. I can't socialize, reason, or just generally think like the majority of people. I'm just not intellectualy, emotionally, or cognitively up to par with most of society. It takes forever to learn someone's name, I have very limited visual memory, I can't really put timeframes on memories, nor tell you what I did on a certain day of the week. I also don't know what day of the week it is half the time. I don't learn or recognize patterns in things like people should, I no longer have a general sex drive possibly because of somethig called PSSD from taking paxil for a month then quitting it. Things are not looking good.



This chapter probably starts when I got into a relationship with my ex, a young, beautiful, driven, Intellegent personal trainer. I knew she was unlike anyone I'd been with before, she was functioning, had gained independence, had goals etc. I had to try to quell my insecurities, not go back into a depressive episode, and start actually building my life for it to work. Well, that all fell apart, I've never been with someone so sought after and even though a lot of it was me just being crazy already, I learned that she was consistently lying to me after we moved in together. Basically drove myself to the brink of insanity trying to figure that situation out and ruined what I originally saw as the perfect chance at starting to become a functioning human, I unfortunately did not realize just how broken I was. Ignorance truly was bliss. 



But now, Im lucky enough to work for people that seem to genuinely care about my well being. I do laundry in a homeless shelter basically. Clean the beds and kind of just exist there in a state of stupor and here recently everyday of existing like this eats at me a little more. I went through a long bout of spending everyday just thinking of suicide, but I'm starting to move past that. But, thanks to the people that employ me, I have a housing voucher, an apartment picked out, balls already rolling to get in there, which sounds great, right. Well. The issue is that it kind of hit me that I have something. Therapist was thinking dependent/borderline personality disorder. I first went to her because I wanted help with the jealousy but she ended up as just an ear for me to fill with all the discoveries I made through my obsessional investigations. Psychiatrist put me on Latuda, and would've rushed an antipsychotic faster, just because my attempts to talk to her were so disorganized she wondered if I could even keep a job until the genetic test and labs came back. Then a month later put me on Focalin because of me complaining about the executive dysfunction. She also said that it could be ASD, which would make sense. There were people throughout my life that noticed something was off in me, teachers, friends, friends parents, and probably way more than I'm aware of. Like I had a learning disability or something. But nonetheless, here I am. Single, for the first time since I was a teenager. The glue that held my weird, dysfunctional family home together is dying of liver disease and my mom and her boyfriend are what's left here. My mom's just as messed up as me, although she has some minimal strengths. He's got some sense to him, her bf, but he's OCD and bipolar, and I know I can't stay here. I can't live with my mom till Im 50. Not like my mom did, because her mom had the stability and intellectual/mental soundness to support her, and mine doesn't. I also don't want that to be my life. But at this point, right now, I don't know how I'm going to survive on my own. I don't know how I'm going to eat everyday, I don't know how I'm going to keep my apartment liveable, idk how I'm going to find a will to wake up and keep facing life with this malfunctioned brain, I don't know how I'm supposed to find the safety I crave, the comfort I desire. And I don't know how I'm going to do it because my life is almost going to be completely under my control. There's no one to fall back on and have food cooked, or remind me of something, or keep me accountable. And based on my accomplishments, or lack there of, based on my behaviors, based on my abilities, I just don't see how life is going to be possible. There's no magic pill to make me into one of the people with that spark of life and imagination. There's no therapist who can just talk me through my feelings enough to show me how to live and survive and follow my own path. There's no easy way and doing nothing isn't going to be enough. I don't know how I'm going to make it like this. I've not been the best human throughout this life I've led, I've been lost, I've been a liar, cheater, drug addict as a teen, abusive to my sibling as a child, absent as a dad, terrible as a son, and just a scummy individual in so many cases.  Maybe I deserve this. But, I can't help but feel that these deficits are what led me to these poor choices and disgusting actions, just as much as my actions justify the deficits.  How do I overcome something like this, something like ASD with intellectual disability, something like a personality disorder, something like bipolar disorder, something, whatever it's name is, something like this.",1
"Ever since I was younger I think I've had something wrong with me. My kindergarten teacher once said I couldn't chew gum and walk at the same time, and I don't think it got any better with time. Ive never been able to really click into a social group, I missed months and months of school in elementary. I played video games addictively and felt so anxious and out of place at school. I could never really strategize or plan or figure things out. I never had any organization and my hand writing hasn't really improved since back then. I don't really have a clear sense of self and my thoughts are so all over the place and obsessive, and I can't really recognize a pattern in them. I can't tell what I need to do.  And I'm also very much a procrastinater, but I'll just not do anything even when it comes down to it. I guess it's initiative im lacking. I'll start to do something simple and forget what I need to do it or get confused and everything out of order. I can't remember things clearly that happened yesterday let alone distant memories.  I feel like the only thing that has ever kept me afloat was my messed up family and having people that made food and kept things running to an extent. I couldn't see how unable I was to think logically and do things that made sense and figure things out till recently. I've not been single more than a couple months here and there until now. I was with an intelligent person, a solid 10/10 personal trainer. Apparently I attach myself anxiously and can't trust. I drove myself even more crazy investigating her and got myself to the point where I was anxious and depressed 24/7. It was like paranoia about her cheating and she lied about a few things and there were a few strange occurrences but I was never able to trust. I was obsessed and unlike the other people id been with she was more of a strong individual and healthy enough to see that my ways of living were unhealthy. It's like I can't see how I am effects others and I can't understand logically how the things I do effect someone else because I'm not logical, smart, or healthy enough to see how things affect me. It's like being a confused lost child stuck in a 25 year old man's body. Also I took paxil for a month, 5 mg then quit because it was causing ED. I took it to last longer which was dumb but I really thought it would be a way to overcome a life long insecurity. Since I stopped I haven't really had a libido and no longer get erections throughout the day. I also could see it make me enjoy things less and feel zombie like. But it's been like 3 months or something and I still don't really have libido and only the act of actually ending in sex sparks it. I have a very weak mind, a very weak will, and no problem solving skills really. I can't survive because before the meds and before going crazy I relied on familiarity and the safety of solitude and my emotions that follow those things to keep me going. They were what guided my decisions because its like impossible for me to think a situation through logically and see what had the best opportunity or outcome. I can't come up with an original thought it seems, I can't visualize imagery clearly. And to think I went through life thinking that I was okay at some point of crazy because a lot of the disorganization and troubles have been there for so long. I just wish I could exist like a normal person and remember right, and plan, and see clearly. It's like going through life on auto pilot and never retaining much to learn from. I want to know what's wrong, I want to understand what the issue is. I know that Im probably bipolar and the manic episodes get so bad that I get psychosis a little I think and feel chosen. People think I'm on meth because of how fast I'll talk and Stutter a bit.  Idk there are any experts in here that could maybe ask some key questions, and it's hard to even really know the answers to them sometimes because I don't really clearly see my patterns or behaviors or remember them all.  My theories are some kind of personality disorder coupled with maybe a nonverbal learning disability or something on the spectrum. An underdeveloped frontal lobe from drug use as a teen and young adult. There's a lot it could be but I'm just scared of living not the same as everyone who can hold it together and be an individual and exist in the ways they do.",1
"So, I’ve been on buspar and paxil for a while. Along with clonidine and Lamictal. Basically, your girl is a mess. 

I’ve had to see multiple doctors recently regarding some physical health issues. And several of them have questioned the buspar, and paxil together and tell me it’s a bad idea. That is can cause serotonin syndrome and serious heart problems. 
But I’ve been on them for years with more than one psych NP, and a psychiatrist as well, and no one has ever batted an eyelash. No pharmacist has ever questioned it either. 
I’ve never had high blood pressure or anything suggesting a heart issue.
But I panicked and tried to get off the paxil. My doctor was a little surprised as to why, and I just tried to shrug it off. Say it was because of dry eyes and headaches, which turns out are unrelated.
And now, I’m an absolute mess. My anxiety and panic are a nightmare. I cry constantly.

TL;DR: Buspar and Paxil has worked well for me for years, but several regular (non-psych) doctors have raised concerns about the interactions. Tried to get off of paxil and now I’m a mess.

What should I do here? I don’t know who’s right or wrong or what",1
"Mostly venting- but feedback would help

I’ve experienced GAD for about a decade now. Ive been on Buspar for a number of years, and while it helps with the daily anxiety of being a person, it doesn’t help with things like having to take the subway, or the dentist, so i use Ativan as needed. Due to how stupid our health care system is i had to start with a new office/set of providers. I loved the first doctor i was placed with he had no issue with how i was medicated and no problem filling my scripts. after about 3 visits with him i  got a call the he had resigned and i would be placed with a different doctor within the office. Bummer but these things happen.    
Doctor #2  immediately had issue with my treatment plan and said i should be on an SSRI and no Ativan. I explained that i use it very infrequently, sometimes going months with out needing any, but she was not hearing this and said i should try Prozac. I’ve been very resistant to SSRi’s since an old GP prescribed me Paxil and the first dose sent me to the hospital. I had to convince her to start me on a lower dose the normal, but i was willing to try cause maybe it could make my life better.  
I took 10 Mg of Prozac for a month and had a horrible tremor, shaky legs, no appetite and feeling like i was communicating badly with everyone around me. The feed back from friends was that “i was upsettingly calm”. At my follow up appointment the doc said this wasn’t good and that i should try something else. She prescribed Pristiq and said to stop Prozac that day and start Pristiq tomorrow. This sounded wild to me considering the side effects i was having. 15 minutes into my 30 minute telemedicine visit she said she needed to cut my appointment short because she had to go to the bathroom. Not that an emergency had come up. Something about the way she was prescribing and cutting my appointment short really rubbed me the wrong way and i asked to see someone else.  
I was now on to my 3rd doctor at the same place. This new one also did not like my Buspar /Ativan as needed method and we should try some other SSRI’s at low dose. Again, i knew that this kind of thing is trial and error, and maybe it could make my life better so we tried Zoloft. I broke a 25mg tablet in half for a month and i still had a tremor, stomach issues, very jittery, and got lots of feed back that i was kind of being a bitch at work.   
We moved on to Lexapro-5mg. My coordination s was so off. I would run into things i had just been looking at. I fell down the last few stairs of flight of stairs because i was so dizzy.  
Abilify 5mg- everything smells rotten and food sucks. Vomiting, restlessness, uncomfortable, could not stay in a chair. I spent a lot of money on things like lotto scratchers.   
Effexor 37.5 mg- This one was the worst. I would start getting the “rushes” around 4am and would have to get up and do something. So no sleep, increased anxiety, spending hours at the gym and going on long walks to burn off energy. I lasted 8 days on it.  
The doctor seems to finally be coming around to the fact that i am a very sensitive flower and that these meds don’t really work for me. We are upping the buspar but she it still being very strict about my ativan use (which increased greatly during the abilify/effoxor switch.   
Im off effexor for 10 days now. Still not sleeping well, but my anxiety does seem to be getting better. I feel like over all shit, but it does seem to be getting better.   
TL:DR  
Ive been on 5 different Psych meds in the last 6-7 months, all with horrendous effects  
Should I see my GP for blood work? I don’t even know what to look for, but maybe something else is up?  
Is this normal for trying to figure out anxiety?   
Should I be looking for a new center/ doctor?",1
"I had mild depression after my wedding, and it ruined all the fun of a wedding. 

Then I went to a doctor, and he prescribed me Paxil, which started to make me feel better, but I couldn't reach a climax. Then, after 3 months, I switched to Escitalopram, and I didn't feel any different from Paxil. 

I continued taking it for only 25 days, and then I stopped taking it. For a month I didn't take anything, but I was not able to feel emotions or any kind of feeling. 

Then my doctor put me on vortioxetine for 2 months, and it gave me horrible derealization. I then switched to agomelatine for a month, and it didn't make any difference. 

I need your advice and to know how your experience was with vortioxetine or agomelatine.

Note: I was not able to feel intense emotions during depression; I was super sad the next day of my wedding for no reason. Now my most important problem that interface in my life so much is derealization, forgetfulness, brain fog, no motivation",1
"I just got off Mirtazapine cold turkey like 2 weeks ago. Off Kratom since Friday, 9 December, had a relapse yesterday. I started using Lyrica (Pregabalin) on Sunday, 11 December, to combat and go through the withdrawals. I took it from Sunday to Friday last week. So 5 days in total, mostly 150mg in the morning, two days another 150mg in the evening. It really helped me to still go to work, be able to finish my tasks, and get out of bed or my apartment. I still suffer badly but it's the only thing that really helps me do something, get out of bed, and have way less social anxiety (still shy and introvert but way less antisocial and anxious, more talkative, esp no physical anxiety like shakes anymore). I took it these 5 days, then 2 days off (last Saturday and Sunday), then today again 150mg in the morning + 100mg in the evening as I had a university essay and a presentation today. It helped. I even think about going to the gym now, I managed to eat one whole meal so far, which is great.

My doc even prescribed me lyrica for daily use or whenever i need it but I never have been taking it more than once every one or two weeks as I was and still am horribly anxious about lyricas own dependance and withdrawal that can be bad according to some people. And that using it regularly just makes my condition worse in the end and offers me another bad withdrawal time that puts me even deeper to the ground of deep depression.

As I suffer more than anytime, probably because of withdrawing from Kratom AND Mirtazapine (while I thought Mirtazapine has no severe withdrawal, might also only be the kratom withdrawal), and I don't eat (lost 5kg/10lbs in these 2 weeks), I don't sleep and feel very fucked, insane, can't move much or do anything functional, I was wondering if it would be the best to just go back on Mirtazapine. But otherwise I'm very happy and proud that I got off Mirtazapine and don't have to take it daily anymore. I just don't know what to do. I know lyrica would help me if I continue taking it. But I also know there can be harsh withdrawal for many people who take Lyrica daily. Mirtazapine might have withdrawal, too and maybe I should just use this opportunity to finally get off Mirtazapine (which even didn't help my depression much, did nothing for my social anxiety, BUT it made me eat and sleep which can contribute to improving depression). Mirtazapine is the 14th med Im trying now, without much or any success. Life still has been a daily pain and suffering since trying these meds and 3 different psychotherapies for 5 or more years now.

What would you do in my position? Get on the lyrica train as many do and swear on but also many suffer from withdrawing in the end? Get back on Mirtazapine and hope to be better in one or two weeks, finally eating and sleeping again, and getting back on my weight (I always was skinny but now am really thin cauese of not being able to eat or drink at all).

Also my doc just prescribed me Lithium (as my 15th med to try plus 30mg Mirtazapine - my doc doesnt know that I quit it) on last Monday but as I don't suffer bipolar depression and I couldn't find any information or studies for Lithium being succesful for unipolar depression or social anxiety (which is my biggest source of depression) I just hesistated to take it until now.

Otherwise I also have many supplements left I still wanted to try and had hope that they can be finally ""heal"" me. Lavender extract, Bacopa, Rhodiola Rosea extract, SAM-e, Dopa Mucuna, Lemon Balm, Gotu Kola extract, Magnolia Bark extract, GABA (not bought yet but maybe was thinking of: Kanna, Lions Mane Mushroom, DXM low dose, Polygala, Tongkat Ali?). Can any of these be helpful for my withdrawal and depression and social anxiety even if 14 pharmaceutical meds didn't help?

It's hard to decide which way to go as all of these meds need time to work and I don't have the time or ability to suffer that long until I know if a med or supplement works or if it does not.

* Lithium seems so unuseful for my issues as there are only studies using it for bipolar, but I don't have bipolar depression, still my doc sees a reason why she prescribed it to me, I guess, as next trial after 14 failed meds and 3 failed psychotherapies. I just don't see the reason as there is no science I can find behind it.
* I could take Mirtazapine and I know I'd probably start eating and sleeping again in 1-2 weeks thanks to Mirtazapine but otherwise I think I might get dependent on it (Idk if this is withdrawal from Mirtazapine or Kratom or both, but if it's Mirtazapine too, I'd be better now off of it than prolonging the use and withdrawal of Mirtazapine).
* I surely won't touch Kratom again for a while as I've really been dependent on it, and it just fucks with my mental health after one week daily use and I also don't eat on it to get effects on empty stomach 24/7. It just isn't worth using it daily and I have to take a looong break from it until I can start using it like once a week max. Because I know when I only used it once a week it was effective and giving me good results but daily use just worsens my state a lot.
* I could continue Lyrica, with the very high risk for dependence and withdrawal when trying to quit it one day but I know it works for my social anxiety better than any med before, even if it's only a little lift. Otherwise many use it daily as no other meds worked and they just pay the price for a bit of life quality and one day going off of it with bad withdrawals and maybe long-term damage (?). How's your experience with Lyrica as therapeutical daily use for depression and social anxiety? Ever tried to get off of it? Is it possible or a very bad idea to use it daily even if it's the only thing helping a bit?
* I could try any of the above mentioned supplements I still haven't tried (I tried many others before without success but maybe you have some other supps that helped you with treatment-resistant depression and social anxiety when no other even strong pharmaceutical meds didn't help. but at that point I also think, if strong pharmaceutical meds couldn't help me or treat me right, how could a supplement do?)
* I could ask for another medication than Lithium. I will surely tell my doc that I hesistated to try Lithium until now as I couldn't find any studies on it for my issues anywhere and was overthinking of going on another med again, just failing, having no success and maybe side effects and withdrawal of it for no success or effects in contrary. What meds could I still try if 14 meds didn't work?

I already tried these meds and no one treated my depression and social anxiety, not even touched it except for Mirtazapine enabling me to eat more and sleep better:

* Escitalopram (Cipralex)
* Promethazine
* Venlafaxine (Effexor)
* Quetiapine (Seroquel)
* Sertraline (Zoloft)
* Opipramol
* Paroxetine (Paxil)
* Duoloxetine (Cymbalta)
* Moclobemide (Aurorix) (weakest MAOI)
* Amitriptyline
* Gabapentin
* Diazepam (Valium)
* Mirtazapine (Remeron) => makes me eat and sleep, probably lil effective cause of helping with that
* Bupropion (Wellbutrin)
* Pregabalin (Lyrica) => lil effective

All no success. Plus 2 depth psychological psychotherapies and 1 cognitive behavioral therapy, all failed, too. No success.

Still open to try, some meds I just noted some days I was desperated and surfing through the web for alternatives and relief:

* Ketamine (any experiences? also expensive and hard to find where I live)
* Psilocybin (Magic Mushrooms) (have big anxiety of horror trips and psychosis etc., also illegal here)
* Ayahuasca (maybe in a south american treatment center but hella expensive)
* rTMS or ECT (any experiences? also hard to find)
* Meds I didn't try yet: Tranylcypromin (Parnate, irreversible MAOI, affects both enzymes in comp to Moclobemide), Clomipramine (but serotonergic drug and ssris/snris never worked so far), Lamotrigine (Mood Stabilizer, idk if this would be making sense?), Selegiline (MAO-B-I), Amisulpride (low dose should be effective for social anxiety and drive/energy/anhedonia), Tianeptine (Sulfat/Sodium, but should have a high addiction and withdrawal risks as I heard), Vortioxitine (Serotomodulator/stimulator), Buspirone, Hydroxzine, Risperidone (Mood Stabilizer), Abilify (Add-On, potent. AD one doc I found on youtube swears on being effective for depression for every of his patients he tried it on, maybe antipsychotic worth a try?), Rasagiline (MAO-B-I), Tofisopam, Trimipramine, Doxepine, Milnaneurax, Propranolol, Dopaminergic: Pramipexol, Ropinirol, Mianserine, Maprotiline, ADHD meds (i possibly suffer from ADD and just never got diagnosed it? reason why no meds or therapies worked so far for me as wrong diagnosis?: Atomoxetin, Modafinil, Ritalin, Dexamphetamin, Lisdexamfetamin), other Benzos (Clonazepam, Bromazepam, Alprazolam, Oxazepam)

Any idea what you'd do in my position? Rn I don't eat and just starve all the time, I don't drink, I don't sleep, this is very unhealthy so I have to do something PLUS my horrible depression and social anxiety not enabling me to go out, see friends, just canceling all appointments, dont visit university anymore and probably just have to quit my masters degree and never make real friends or romantic relationships, having no future in sight, while also being cognitively very retared and probably just turned dumb, no skills, no knowledge, just no future and no strengths or anything I could offer anyone - and the anxiety I could never catch up on all these things, skills, knowledge and experience other already have in my age (im 23 now).

I feel like I've missed out on a lot of experience and knowledge to survive in adulthood EVEN IF let's say survive depression and social anxiety itself. I don't know, I surely remember when I first noticed my mental health issues that my deep depression had big impacts on my cognition and joy or ability to learn things. The social anxiety contributed to this ""cogntive performance/ability"" in public of course. Now I don't know if it might have been all the many different meds I tried or the depression or a combination which made me so freaking dumb that kills my hope for being able to live a normal life even if I'd be able to finally ever feel not fucking hellishly depressed and freakingly socially anxious once. These are thoughts like I just dont have learned any skills, any knowledge about any topic or profession, might it just be football, basketball, following it on the TV and knowing about players, I don't know anything about cars or mechanics as some men my age do and makes them somehow ""manly"" for me, I can't play any instrument or don't play any sports in a team, I don't know anything about politics or any science topic. I'm just blank. Only positive I see is that I'm at least a good looking young man, a good looking loser. I feel so unmanly because of not knowing anything about this stuff and have no skills or knowledge I can offer. Makes me suicidal and reducing my self confidence and self worth a lot. I was really often thinking about having ADD (but started only very late or no one rarely urged to test me on this as I have social anxiety and by that surely am not the hyperactive ADHD type - i heard the missing H part is the reason why many ADHD patients get ignored even if the attention deficit disorder is still fully present).

I really have big hopes on meds even if 14 different ones didn't work yet but I don't know how my life could change other than a med, supplement or any substance being finally effective and supporting me cause I tried so much (therapies, diet, sports - they only help a little) and I really think it's just my brain chemistry and it can't get better without any substance helping me... even my new doc said this type of depression and anxiety I have can only be solved by pharmaceutical help or biochemical influence from the outside as so much didn't help me until now and I tried so much.

Sorry for the long text. This makes me see that Lyrica helped me to day with my issues as otherwise I would never have the energy to write so much and not feel bad and just crawl into my bed doing nothing than starving and staring on the wall or trying to sleep and just not feel my horrible feelings of depression, self hate and future anxiety. I really am living unhealthy now, so at this moment I really take even withdrawal of lyrica just to survive. But idk if this is a very bad idea. I try to not take it tomorrow, but maybe I feel so horrible again that I have to at least eat one meal, drink a bit of water, get out and get something done for university or other todos I just skipped for 2 weeks now...",1
"I‘m 23 now, suffering from severe and treatment resistant depression since I was 15. When I was 17 I first called a professional cause I knew there wasn‘t something right with me and this suffering isn‘t normal. It mainly all started being surely problematic with 17 but the symptoms probably even started with 10 or earlier, at least I can think of similar symptoms back in these times.

So I called the doc at 17 alone first time, letting no one else know, and I got treatment. Now, 23, I‘m over 14 different medications and 3 talk therapies (psychotherapeutical depth psychological as well as CBT) all without NO success. I‘m now 23 and just got off Mirtazapine and Wellbutrin 1 week ago. Also I got off Kratom at the same time (started using he Kratom cause no treatment worked).

I now lay in bed since Saturday, doing nothing, can‘t eat, can‘t drink, can‘t move. I even quit my job on Friday. Still studying my master (have a bachelor at least already). But I just feel hell as shit now and don‘t know anything to do, I dont see any hope or any future. My cognition is also very bad, I feel like the dumbest and most worthless human. I lay way behind everyone else in my age regarding knowledge or skills, let‘say any professional knowledge but also about any sports (like following professional soccer, basketball or even playing it), I dont have any knowledge about anything, sports, cars, professions, sciences, literature, anything.

My doc just prescribed me Lithium now as next trial for medication. She told me to start taking it on Tuesday. I still didnt‘t start taking it cause I only can read it using for bipolar, never ever any studies or such for depression itself (without mania) or social anxiety and rn I just survived the day by drinking 3 beers, not eating anything or drinking more than a glass of water. I feel retarded, sad, socially incapable and dumb and no clue how to go on. Life has nothing to offer for me, it‘s such a big draining unsurvivable feeling of sadness and being imcapable.

Thinking about suicide and hosted psychiatry many times but also just looking for a quick fix as other people my age and „friends“ just live so happily and have their way rn so I dont wanna be the crazy guy being in a psychaitric wardness, especially as Id how it would help me after these many faile treatments.

"Hi, this is going to be a long post, so if you read it, thanks. I've been diagnosed with Bipolar Depression in the past. Within 30 minutes of meeting the first psychiatrist I've ever seen, she diagnosed me. So I don't believe this diagnosis at all. I also am not here to get diagnosed, as I know that's not possible. I am seeing a new internist next week and I am hoping to get referred to a psychiatrist now that I have health coverage.

So I was born with a lot of issues due to my birth mother doing a lot of drugs while pregnant with me. I was born premature at 32 weeks with cocaine, heroin, and methadone in my system. I had seizures for the first two years of my life. I was instantly taken away from my birth mother and I was in the NICU for the first 6 months of my life. I was adopted at 4 years old by my foster mother who took me in as soon as I left the hospital. I had ankle braces and I had to get occupational therapy and physical therapy at a cerebral palsy center until I was 4 years old. I'm now 33 years old. I've been suffering from chronic migraines since I was 15. I also had headaches a lot as a kid.

I didn't start seeing someone about my mental health until my adoptive mother died. I was 20. I've been diagnosed with Bipolar Depression, Depression, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I've been on Paxil, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Seroquel, Effexor, Celexa, Ativan, Xanax, and others. They all help at the beginning, then stop helping, even with dosage increases. Recently I'm starting to think I'm autistic or I have OCD or something. I really hope I can get a clear answer from a doctor soon.

But lately, what's been really bothering me, is, people tell me I say things or do things and I don't recall doing or saying them and vice versa. This has been going on for years and I only just realized it must be an issue because my husband is pointing it out a lot. When I was a teenager, I got yelled at by my mom A LOT. As a kid too. So I apologize all the time. However, my ex in high school would tell me that my mom wasn't yelling at me because he was there to witness it. Another example is: my most recent ex would tell me I did things and I didn't remember doing them. I have a really bad temper and my actions have been described as ""adult temper tantrums."" I am able to recognize that, but it all comes on so fast and I don't know how to stop it. I've tried breathing exercises and mindfulness and that doesn't work, either.

A few months ago, my husband started telling me I repeat myself A LOT. One example is: I told him Overwatch is on sale and I'd like to purchase it. He responded with ""You must really be excited about Overwatch. We should buy it soon."" I asked him what he meant by that and he had said I told him about it 5 times that day. I didn't think  I ever mentioned it before. I tell him things and he knows about it because apparently I told him a million times.

I also seem to need to be explained things over and over again or I don't understand the assignment. I've been told this at my jobs. This also happened in school. I failed most of the tests I've taken in school. I had horrible reading comprehension skills as a kid and still do. I never received any tutoring. I tried starting college and got pretty close to my degree, then failed out and couldn't continue due to funds. I took all $60,000 out in federal loans that they allow. So I can't finish. Nor do I believe I'm capable.

Anyway, I have a 4-month-old son and I want to be better for him. I feel awful. I'm scared that the things I'm experiencing might be blackouts since I can't recall things I said or did and I'm afraid of this affecting him negatively. Last week, I drove across a highway and there was a dip dividing the lanes (instead of a median wall, which is really odd to me) and I drove into it because I thought it was flat all the way across the road. We were fine, but I scratched up the front of my car. I'm terrified. I'm never thinking clearly and it's only getting worse.",1
"Im 22 and have been suffering from severe depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old. I tried 2 depth psychological therapies, one behavioral one and over 13 different meds (SSRI, SNRI, atypical, tetracyclic, moclobemide, neuroleptics) without any success. Nothing helped.

Im on Mirtazapine now and while its the only one that had a tiny bit effect at least (better sleep, better appetite) I still suffer a lot daily. I got on it after long break of ADs as my doc told me its very low-risk and she was right, at least regarding side effects (Idk about possible withdrawal) which I dont have any, except for sleepiness after I take it and increased appetite, but I welcome that as I had bad insomnia and sleep issues and Im very skinny.

So I was wondering if I just give a new med I never tried before a try or try the Mirtazapine + another med as a combo. Im really desperate and just started a new job I really like and dont want to lose, but in my condition right now I cant keep it up any longer if I dont improve mentally. I also registred for the gym and changed my diet, but Im still depressed and anxious af. Also my cognition is very bad.

Is there any antidepressant that has low risks for side effects and withdrawal that you could recommend me? Im adding the list of my tried antidepressants below so you have an overview. Thinking about Clomipramine, Vortioxetine, Tranylcypromine, Selegiline or just simple Wellbutrin (tried once but gave up after 1 week as I was having bad anxiety, now I know it was probably due to my at that time Phenibut withdrawal)

* Cipralex (Escitalopram) + Promethazine
* Venlafaxine (Effexor) + Quetiapine (Seroquel)
* Sertraline (Zoloft)
* Opipramol
* Paroxetine (Paxil)
* Duloxetine (Cymbalta)
* Moclobemide (Aurorix)
* Amitriptyline
* Gabapentin
* Mirtazapine",1
I have been on the antidepressant paroxetine(Paxil) in the past but I kept forgetting it then stopped entirely. Since then I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and I’m on Ritalin. I recently restarted the antidepressant(it’s the only one that’s ever worked for me) and since starting it (it’s been about 3-4 days now) I’ve been having issues with irritability and panic attacks. Is this a normal sudden side effect to restarting it or should I be concerned? I do have factors in my life that are affecting my anxiety but not to the point of having a panic attack everyday for the past few days.,1
"Memory loss is a common topic within the mental health world. I'm an RN that works in Mental Health & going to do my best to summarize some research on *which* mental health medications impact our memory and *why* they do.

**Memory** refers to the mechanisms that are used to collect, accumulate, preserve, and later retrieve information. There are three actions involved in **'memory'**: processing, storing, and recalling.

## I will Include the link to the original post that is probably easier to follow but also going to include all the info below.

## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs

**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**

### Drug class

This is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain. Over 10% of the US takes an SSRI.

### What Do SSRIs Do?

What does every medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, you’re blocking the neurons from reabsorbing Serotonin, meaning there is more Serotonin available.

So what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.

Did You Know?

Serotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. While we can measure the levels in our blood we cannot measure the levels within our brain. Meaning we’re all in the dark as to how much is within our brain and whether or not it’s even correlated to the amount in our blood.

How SSRIs Impact Memory

Age and gender do not seem to influence the data that SSRIs are correlated with memory effects. Something that is important to mention, is that while research has shown that SSRIs are *correlated* with memory loss, that doesn’t exactly mean that they CAUSE it. Correlation and cause are two different things. Many people that take SSRIs also take benzodiazepines, drink, smoke, have genetic predisposition to memory loss, etc. Depression and anxiety themselves can even cause memory problems.

Summary

So, after reading through many articles, there overall wasn’t enough credible information to emphatically say that an SSRI causes memory loss. In fact, I came across more research that suggested SSRIs improve cognitive performance and memory. Some data also specifically supported that SSRI’s can improve memory for patients experiencing psychosis and depression.

## Tricyclic Antidepressant  | TCAs

**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**

Drug Class

The word “tricyclic” refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed before SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays. TCAs are still often administered for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.

What do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?

What do all TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors. These key differences create a cascade of effects in the body that do impact memory. These key differences are also the culprit for the common side effects in this drug class like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.

Did You Know?

In 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 ( a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new 'invention' was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.

How TCAs Impact Memory

There are multiple reasons why a TCA impacts our memory. **The first reason** is that we retain memory best when norepinephrine is released at an optimal rate. These drugs block the reabsorption of norepinephrine; which is known to be a moderator of memory. With too much of it, we are anxious and stressed, too little of it and we are drowsy and not as coherent. Either way, the drug has an impact on norepinephrine which directly influences how we store memory.

**The second reason** why this drug class impacts memory is because it competes with our natural antagonists on muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is well documented that these drugs block muscarinic receptors (which is an acetylcholine receptor), and acetylcholine directly impacts learning and memory.

>*“Muscarinic* acetylcholine *receptors* in the hippocampus and cortex underlie *memory* formation”

Summary

So, TCAs are a drug that research has linked with memory impairments and dementia. These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life (even could improve memory if their extreme anxiety was impairing it), while for another it can make them drowsy and leave a bad impression.

\*Note each drug within the class impacts the degree of these effects a little differently.

## Benzodiazepines

**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**

Drug Class

These are commonly considered anti-anxiety medication (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.

&#x200B;

Let’s taco ‘bout it.

This drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which slows down our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).

Did You Know?

Anesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?

How Benzodiazepines Impact Memory

This drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is advantageously quick acting, the effects linger.  Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.

This is why a rehab center isn’t going to allow the use of 'said drug' while ‘recovering’. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking 'said drug' while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning & you're not able to remember anything, how can you work on it? The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.

Now, don't shoot the messenger. Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They're an actual life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with *repeated* use we will need *increasingly* higher doses, making the dent in your memory more and more indisputable.

Full Disclosure

My mother was an addict, benzodiazepines being her drug of choice.

Do you know an addict whose drug of choice is a benzodiazepine? No SHAME, but if so, you can probably attest that **they don’t remember shit.** 

How about an addict whose drug of choice is alcohol? All love here, but you can say for certain, *they don’t remember shit*.

There has even been a fair amount of data to support that the risk of Alzheimer’s is elevated in those taking the drug for over 6 months. One Harvard study even speculated that it would raise the risk by 84%! Seems unrealistic, but who am I to question Harvard; I'll add the link below if you're also feeling speculative.

Another point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.

This is often what is referred to as *“rebound anxiety”*  because your anxiety is likely to get worse, before it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken long term.

Take it from a nurse who works in mental health; it's not enjoyable being the bystander of a patient trying to escape their benzo addiction.

But this is why the mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time.

Now, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please don’t go flush yours down the toilet after reading this.

When Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is that we’re now in a benzo addiction crisis. We’re learning over time, as a society and those changes don’t happen overnight. And trust me, as a mental health professional I myself occasionally grow infuriated at the amount of family doctors who prescribe copious amounts of benzodiazepines only to later turn the patient away after addiction has crippled them.

## Anti-Epileptics

topiramate, topamax, zonisamide, zonegran, levetiracetam, keppra, pregabalin, lyrica, clonazepam, klonopin, rufinamide, banzel, vigabatrin,  sabril, phenytoin, dilantin, oxcarbazepine, trileptal, carbamazepine, tegretol, lamotrigine, lamictal, lacosamide, vimpat, valproic acid, depakote, phenobarbital, gabapentin, neurontin

Drug Class

Anti-seizure medications are commonly used for mood disorders and even anxiety in addition to epilepsy.

What Do They Do?

Epilepsy is caused by **excessive** hyperexcitability of the nervous system therefore, medications in this class are geared toward minimizing excitability. This drug class actually encompasses three different major classes

1. Blocking Sodium Channels
2. Enhancement of GABA Inhibition
3. Regulation of Synaptic Releases

Why it Impacts Memory

Overall, anticonvulsants work in different ways; trust me I rode the magic school for HOURS trying to gain an understanding of them to write this. Truthfully, we still have a lot to learn about them. Their impact is complicated and the effects range based on the dose and drug.

For instance, Topamax has pretty diverse pharmacologic actions, because of that, it **has** been linked with impaired concentration, cognitive dulling, psychomotor retardation, language and comprehension difficulties, rather extreme effects on short-term memory and working memory, poor verbal fluency and word-finding, reduced IQ scores, abnormal thinking and delayed cognitive speed. Because of this dark cloud of side effects, Topamax is sometimes referred to as 'Dope-A-Max'.

However, a more selective medication within the drug class such as Phenytoin or Tegretol are more specific to blocking sodium channels. Overall, they seem to have less impact on memory and cognitive function.

Many of these drugs listed above have an impact on GABA, and long term exposure to GABA agents can alter the functionality of GABA permanently, which means there are potentially permanent consequences to cognition, behaviors, and memory.

Phenobarbital has been linked to lower IQ, and worse effects than Depakote and Tegretol, however it is actually a barbituate. It’s effects are similar to benzodiazepines which you can read more about above.

Gabapentin, used for seizures and often mood disorders, belongs to it's own drug class. Still, it **has** been linked to memory impairment. Hence, the name, it also impacts GABA, which as mentioned several times now, certainly plays a hand in our ability to remember. At this point there isn’t enough research to say it’s linked to dementia though.

As far as drugs for epilepsy, Gabapentin is tolerated much better than many others. It’s also worth mentioning that this drug seems to have more *short term* effects on memory. Some will experience a disorienting feeling or short term memory loss while taking Gabapentin, but the reports of long term memory being impacted are reported less often.

[Long Term Effects of Gabapentin](https://deserthopetreatment.com/sedatives/gabapentin-addiction/long-term-side-effects/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

## Antipsychotics

**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics; risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**

Drug Class

Commonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome & Huntington's disease

What Do They Do?

Most drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.

Did You Know?

Oddly enough, memory seems to actually be improved when using an antipsychotic for a person with psychotic symptoms, though there are many that take medications within this class that are not psychotic. So let's talk about that more.

Why It Impacts Memory

First, let's skip back to the purpose of these drugs. Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it's to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.

This class is broken up into two categories;

**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which do impact the complex way in which we store memories. \*More movement disorders come with the old ones.

**Second Generation: (new, atypical):** Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors**.** Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.

What do they all have in common? **They impact Dopamine.** Long story short; A delicate balance of Dopamine is needed for memory to function. Since this class targets Dopamine, it's fair to say it has the potential to alter our memory. Whether that's a good or bad thing is specific to the patient, but it's typically an unwelcome effect.

# 

&#x200B;

## Antihistamines

**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom,  hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan,  triprolidine, triafed**

Drug Class

Commonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different 'generations' & target different histamine receptors in our body.

* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body
* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion
* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System
* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched

What Do They Do?

We're actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that **anti-**histamines are usually anticholinergic; **blocking** receptors for choline. The problem is that we need choline to be readily available to have the ability to learn, understand and remember.

### Why it Impacts Memory?

Being that antihistamines are often anticholinergic, they do impair our ability to think, learn and remember. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain. We already naturally produce less acetylcholine overtime. This is partly why as we age our ability to remember, think, and learn diminishes. It's widely known that anticholinergics impact memory, thinking, learning, and muscle function. It is also suggested that these drugs increase the risk of developing dementia.

Did you know?

The only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways in addition to the reason why it's administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much less specific in their effects, they are affiliated with greater memory impairment. Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings.

### Summary

Overall, the effects range. Regarding mental health specifically; Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax are commonly prescribed for anxiety. While your risks are much less severe than benzodiazepines, these are FIRST generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this is also means they do impair our ability to remember.

An example of second generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won't do you much good.

Hope this helps clarify some of the impacts of memory and mental health medications. Leave a comment if there is a drug you're still wondering about.

"Hey,

I'm not even sure how to begin this post but here goes.

I gamble and I drink and I've slept at the airport for several days because I couldn't get myself to go back home. I am now back home and I'm 29. I freelance and make decent money.

I saved up 8000$ but I put money into crypto like the genius I am and the market crashed while waiting for COVID restrictions to open up @ Thailand. Two years ago I went to a psychiatrist and he had me try Paxil. I quit after 2 weeks because I had trouble with my erections and I just didn't feel any better. It felt like speed and just a general sense of being uneasy. I didn't go back to him because deep down I don't actually buy into this medication or psychiatry/psychology stuff but my dad wanted me to.

My plan was to fly to Thailand and rent an airbnb and freelance from there, and try get in a better state of mind but COVID happened. I'm now on a alcohol binge week and I've drank 15 bottles of wine in the past week. I didn't drink today, and I feel terrified of the long term effects alcohol has. I've seen what it does to humans, but I'm still stupid enough to go on a binge like this and abuse it. Last night I drank 2 bottles alone in my room. I don't even know why because a month earlier I convinced myself I'd stop drinking altogether and I bought a juicer and started juicing fruit and veggies. Well turns out it wasn't that much fun and I've not juiced anything for the past week.

 I'm planning on flying out in April and hopefully I will feel better about things.

I don't even know what I want to do with my life. I feel super low, and for the first time in my life I've started thinking about suicide. I've not had a relationship in maybe 8 years and I masturbate 5 times a day.

I remember when I called a helpline maybe 2 years back and this woman picked up the phone and I started talking to this english lady just wanted to talk to someone about life, not the masturbation part or anything silly like that. And I'm not sure if it was because I wasn't english but european, but she hung up the phone on me after 90 seconds. Funnily enough this actually helped me in a way, because I was looking for help from others, and I guess in reality, most of us will only be able to help ourselves.

I realize all of this but I'm still the same stupid idiot. Does medication even help for someone like me? I f\*\*\*ing doubt it to be honest. I'm just one amongst many humans who just couldn't help themselves.

I'm starting to dislike humanity a great deal as I'm going along on my own little human journey and I fucking hate everything.

Sorry about this long ramble, I just wanted to write something somewhere. I guess my question is if you guys actually felt better being on medication, or if you would've felt better either way if changes would have happened in your life without medication.",1
"I ""HAD"" severe anxiety issues. Growing up my parents were particularly abusive. They had black and white thinking often shutting down my opinions if they contradicted their own. They would often yell at me, be hyper critical if I made a mistake, and gaslighting me. I was never physically hit but it always came close. The threat was there. I ran away from home 3x's. **Back then my anxiety/depression was at a constant 10/10 in 2014, spiking to 12 to 15/10 under various circumstances.**

**However**, through sheer grit and determination I applied CBT on myself in college in NYC. I constantly went out and talked to people and put myself in uncomfortable situations -- often getting rejected. I learned social cues and destroyed a lot of my preconceived notions about reality. I gained friends and had 2 girlfriends in the course of 4 years. **My anxiety was still at a constant 6/10, sometimes spiking to 8/10.** 

My studies suffered because I still experienced MASSIVE anxiety in my everyday life. I still couldn't sit down, focus, and read/write. The same things that scared me in the past still do but to a lesser degree. 

Fast Forward after a couple months trying to meditate and deal with things organically **I was given paroxetine 25 mg by my psychiatrist.**  It has changed my life, helping me focus on my job as a Software Engineer, form better relationships with friends and parents\*. **My anxiety is at constant 0/10**. **Sometimes spiking to a 2-3/10**. I'm a normal fukkin person now. 

**HOWEVER** sometimes I experience periods of extreme anxiety bursting to an 6-8/10. I used to smoke a lot of **weed**. Like A LOT to curb my anxiety. I stopped 100% 1.5 yearS ago **BUT I still experience a placebo high when I smell it.** I feel slightly high even though I know I am not physically affected by THC. I think my serotonin levels temporarily increase. Then drop after not leaving my apartment and smelling weed. **That's when my anxiety boosts to a constant 4/10, spiking to a 6/10** and a lot of my fears and issues start bubbling back up. It's really damn uncomfortable. 

Should I increase my dosage of paxil to 30-mg with my current psychiatrist or .....?",1
"Last night I was suicidal, completely suicidal, extremely suicidal. I couldn't bare anything and all I wanted to do was take all of my pills and chase them with alcohol. Life has no meaning, life has no purpose, life itself is not worth it. I do not want to hurt anybody who loves me but I just can't do this... If it were for me, I'd be long gone. I have no future, I have no fucking brain, it's like I never process anything of what people tell me and it's been like that forever. Ever since I was a young kid I started to lose interest in life, I started to see everything as so mundane and exhausting but I had to stay strong in order to maintain a good environment at home... My mother has always been exhausted, my sister went through a huge depressive episode and has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder with psychotic episodes. I had to remain strong, I always did and now I can't let myself feel my emotions... I can't even recognize my own emotions.

I remember being bullied, being called gay, a faggot, a fat ass, obese, effeminate, disgusting, progeria, AIDS, cancer at school and all of that I carried in a shell I had built for myself.. but that shell broke, and it all came crashing down to me. My mother who has had problems with alcohol, my family pretending to be the perfect family, my parents' divorce, me trying to be intelligent when I suck, I am nothing. I've lost hope in myself and nobody takes me seriously.

I've taken too much pressure and people tell me that nobody gave it to me, but oh boy did they make me feel so pressured to remain strong and be my best self. I'm sick, I'm depressed, I'm suicidal but I'm too much of a coward to do it. I see no purpose in life anymore, nothing is as pretty as it once was for me. My sister, dog and boyfriend are the only things that are keeping me alive, apart from the cowardice. 

I keep insulting myself in my head, I keep doing things that keep me depressed, I self sabotage, I've self harmed, I intellectually know that people love me but I cannot feel it. I feel like I'm hurting others, and that the only escape from this shithole is death. I'm scared of people getting bored of me and leaving me behind, but I keep talking to them about these things and I feel like that will end up with having them abandon me.

My therapist hasn't wanted to give me a diagnosis but I begged her to tell me what's wrong with me, today I'll talk to her about it, apart from many other things. I **need to know** what's going on with me.

" Hi all,

Stereotypical ""long time reader, first time posting.""

I was a long time worrier for most of my life but at the end of 2016, I had my first panic attack. I started paroxetine (paxil) around then. While the first couple of months of 2017 were rough, I ultimately came to terms with my anxiety and intrusive thinking and at the recommendation of my psych at the time, I weaned off of paroxetine. Things went well until a massive panic in spring of 2019 that led to another month of crippling anxiety while dosing back up to the effective dose of paroxetine by mid May 2019.

This time around it was different: paroxetine didn't seem to cut it. My psych then switched me to sertraline (zoloft). I had fewer side effects, but unfortunately still didn't reduce the severity of my panic attacks. My psych then gave me a genetic test that said that as far as SSRIs/SNRIs go, Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) would be best for me. Frankly it worked pretty well...until it didn't. While I think it reduces the severity of my anxiety and panic attacks, my anxiety isn't sufficiently controlled.

My psych right now is having me try a couple of adjunctive therapies to take along side the Pristiq, one at a time. First was Remeron (mirtazipine), which may have worked a little bit, but it caused me to gain weight and sleep through alarms. Then we tried Wellbutrin (buproprion) which made my anxiety 100x worse. I just started Lamictal (lamotrigine) as an adjunctive therapy, so the jury is still out. I am getting concerned that there won't be a solution for me.

**TL;DR:** Over the course of my time with anxiety I have been trying new drugs at the recommendation of my psych and I am not seeing a whole lot of remission of my anxiety.

Have any of you experienced this? How many therapies have you tried before you found the right one?

Also, I have a therapist I see on a weekly basis in conjunction with my psych",1
"i have GAD, cptsd and major depressive disorder. i was unmedicated for many many years and held up pretty okay. it wasn’t until i was in an abusive relationship that my traumas started resurfacing and i decided to start medication again. my doctor at the time put me on Wellbutrin, Paxil and Lamictal all at the same time. I felt like a zombie all of the time, I’d disassociate while driving so hard that I felt like I was in a video game and couldn’t express happiness or sadness if I wanted. I was a literal walking dead. I stopped all of it cold turkey. I later left my abusive partner and was single three years. During this time, I finally found me. I fell in love with life and myself. I wasn’t medicated. I still struggled with all of my illnesses but I was free for the first time it felt like. 

Rewind one year and two months ago, I met the love of my life. My first healthy relationship (although not perfect and at times codependent). Things were absolutely wonderful, out of a dream really... until late March. Lockdown hit. We unexpectedly moved twice SUPER last minute. The first was a vacation that turned into a permanent vacation until I lost my best friend, we couldn’t find jobs after three months of looking HARD and my mental health started severely declining. I was having panic attacks nearly every day. I attempted suicide twice in one month (my last suicide attempt prior was at the age of 14, nearly 12 years ago) I felt like a monster. My partner and I were living together for the first time and very very excited about it at first. Until we literally couldn’t get away from each other. I started to feel trapped. I know she did too. We started fighting constantly. I was having the worst CPTSD flashbacks. I was remembering things I’ve never been able to remember. Having panic attacks so bad I would convulse and my eyes would black out. I started having outbursts in which I couldn’t control my anger so I would hit myself. The city we both once loved, hurt too much to be in, so we moved again. 

I started zoom therapy and Gabbapentin. The Gabbapentin was realllllly helping with my moods and my ptsd. I felt better. I was excited about a fresh start in a new city. My girlfriend went back down to FL for a few weeks and I got our place set up. I started a job at a restaurant and hated it. Quit right after I finished my training. A week later, I found my current job (another restaurant gig). I loved it at first. I started falling back into a deep depression. I’m a clinical facial specialist. I was making 3.5-4K a month working 20-25 hour weeks. I lost my job due to COVID. I can’t get my license up here right away bc I’m short 30 hours. Now I’m back in the service industry working 30-35 hours a week and making 1.2k a month.... now, I also have an invisible illness. The doctors don’t know what’s wrong with me yet. I have extremely bad “IBS”. I’m intolerant to just about all types of food. I’m constantly in pain and sick. I puke often and have diarrhea most every day unless constipated. People at work have been talking about me behind my back and saying that I’m always in the bathroom or sick with stomach things. I’ve had three people within the past week tell me they don’t like me bc of it. I’ve also not had the easiest time making friends here bc I’m always feeling ill, working, I don’t drink really and honestly depression x anxiety. It’s been a lonely and hard past 6 months.  

Rewind back to March, I bought my first vehicle. 2017 Honda 23k miles. Fucking. Fell. In. Love. 
Within one day, she was giving me issues. I took it into the dealership I bought it from (turn and burn lot) and they sent it to Honda. 800 in repairs. After that, it ran perfectly. Fast forward until two weeks ago, it stalled out while I was driving two hours from home while seeing family. No more problems for two weeks after, until this past week when it happened again.  My engine light came on and stayed on, my break light came on and my car was telling me to park immediately. I took it into three different places for opinions and all of the diagnostics came back with the same code: my engine computer and wiring harnesses are fried. 2.6k in repairs. 

I do not have that. 


Now the real point of all this back story shit... two days ago this panic attack ensued. I was hyperventilating, I hit myself (or tried to) multiple times, I was weeping uncontrollably, screaming, flailing at first... I locked myself in our bathroom and fell to the floor and continued hyperventilating, weeping, choking and then my eyes blacked out and I started seizing again. 

I’ve wanted to self harm all week. I haven’t in six years. Before that time, it was ten years. Every time I went to do it prior, I’d stop. This time I didn’t. 

I grabbed a pair of fabric scissors and cut my upper thigh by my hip about ten times. 

I am dealing with so much shame about it. I’m so mad at myself for breaking that six year mark. I’m so ashamed my partner saw me like that and has had to witness and deal with my mental health since quarantine. I’m ashamed to not wear pants. I’m ashamed to look in the mirror even more ashamed to be naked in front of one. I feel ashamed for having to put her through half of the shit I have. 

I feel alone. I’m scared. I miss home. I have no money. 

I think a part of me was hoping to just vent but one part of me wants to not feel alone, the second is happy to have this platform to vent and the third part of me is hoping for an answer. 

Regardless, if you’ve read this far, thank you....",1
" I feel pretty close to rock bottom and really have no one to talk to. I feel it building with me day by day. I struggled with depression and mental health issues when i was in my teens. I felt so worthless, unwanted, stupid, ugly. A total failure at 14. I was always known as the kid who was held back in first grade and in all the special ed classes. It was very hard, and very dark. Was on Paxil for pretty much all my teens along with all kinds of ADD drugs. Not seemed to help me. I completely failed in school, both academically and socially. I was screaming for help. Then boom. The one thing that worked for me. I repeated the 9th grade (another repeated grade)..... At a military school half way across the country. In my most dark time of my childhood - i was sent to the one place that saved me. Over the next 4 year i spend my time doing nothing but achieving. Was never the greatest student (but improved) but i worked hard, was recognized and it simply worked. It built self confidence, it gave me a place to belong, it saved me. I joined the Army in 11th grade and it all did want it needed, turned a scared young insecure kid into something worth their weight. I was proud of myself. Fast forward 6 years i leave the army in relative failure..... It simply didn't work out. since then i tried to make something of myself. With moderate success followed by failure over and over again. I lost my job back in November and have not been able to find employment that replaces even ballpark range of my needed salary. No one finds me of value. if i go get a response, i get one interview then crickets.....Unemployment? HA not a dime and not a word from them. So here i sit, writing this to whoever my read it feeling pretty much at rock bottom. The feeling i had as a kid, i felt them lurking ion the back of my head the last few years or so... knowing they shouldn't be there... but they are. Those feeling i had as a kid are now fully here again... felling worthless, unimportant, a failure, a deadbeat, fat, ugly - i could go on. I now, for the first time over the last 3 months, i have found myself in uncontrollable crying spells. The tiniest thing can trigger it. It last for 5 mins, it last for an hour. It comes and goes so frantically the rational part my my head says this is very bad man. The simple thing will trigger it then with in minutes im crying because i know how much a failure i am. How i had so many opportunities and squandered them all. How i should be a certain way but im not. I'm me, and me is not good enough. I Could go on and on about what i feel inside, about myself but its simply too much. The one thing i do know is that the rational part my me is still there, its what is able to try and pull me out of these dark areas even if only for a short moment sometimes before the tears come again. They say - this isn't normal. its not so bad. why are being like this?... yet i dont have the answers and the dark seems to just be so much more powerful than the rational. I know this is a bad spot to be in.. i could already be in over my head. Im making plans with my partner to move closer to my family - but that is months away and i fear in that time i will fall further and further. When this all started thought of the irreversible decision were just thoughts.... now, is i wipe tears from my eyes during one of the crying spells, i look to my closet where i keep my rifle and have emotions and thoughts that chill me. My god to feels so close and im scared. How can i combat these crying spells? they are so sudden and out of nowhere. They are so powerful, these massive emotions, so overpowering to my rational thought. Im just so scared, so aware of my flaws, so aware of my failures and where i come up short. I know i need to start over - thats the point of moving home, but after todays boute, i fear that could be too far off. I want to stay. I want to be a good person. I want to love. I just want to live. But is seems life wont be so easy on me. Some would say my life has been easy bc i wasnt poor growing up, or abused or ect ect. Im just a normal guy whos having a really hard time navigating this impossible life we all have to live nowadays. What saved you, again? If it worked for you, it could work for me. I dont want to go. i struggle inside every single day. and not a single person sees it. I put on a happy face to hide it. When im on the up and up, its so easy for it to be destroyed. My mood can change so drastically so fast. I just want to have a simple life, love, be loved and have enough to make a little life. I will keep fighting. Im not going to give in. Once i was strong enough. I believe i could be again. Any advice? And words of encouragement? Just a quick thought in your mind where you are pulling for me? I appreciate it. Thank you for listening.

"Dear guys and girls, dear sufferers, dear survivers,

I'm suffering from **depression and social anxiety** since I was 15 years old (now 21). My **symptoms** are painful negative thoughts about past, present and future starting right in the morning when I open my eyes. Otherwise: huge lack of drive/motivation, anhedonia (lack of interests, almost nothing that stimulates me), lethargy, feelings of extremely painful inner emptiness and restlessness (hard to explain but somehow as being alive in a dead body or being buried alive without being able to do anything against it), cognitive decline (focus, memory, access to thoughts) body pain (makes it hard to stand, sit straight, walk, keeping body posture and walk stairs), typical symptoms of social anxiety etc.

**Medication**: I tried 10 different medications until now. 8 antidepressant, 2 neuroleptics: Venlafaxine (Trevilor), Escitalopram (Cipralex), Sertraline (Zoloft), Paroxetine (Paxil), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Opipramol, Moclobemide (Aurorix) and Seroquel (Quetiapine), Promethazine. None worked, none gave me any effect at all except for side effects, sexual ones etc.

**Conversational Therapy**: I had 2 depth psychological therapies. No success. Right now I'm in a behavorial therapy. The therapist is quite good but I never have much to add or feelings of new enlightenments. Makes me think my depression is mainly biological/neurological. Could be.

I discovered **alcohol** in the age of 15, a substance that improves mood just by drinking some liquid, damn, a wow! effect. With 17 I started drinking daily, first only in the evenings to kill negative thoughts, be able to enjoy life and sleep. With the time I began drinking in the mornings and before events especially social ones but somehow for everything: sports, seeing natives, seeing friends, before school, then before university and so on. Imagine being drunk everywhere, sitting buzzed out in school, in lectures of university, playing tennis drunk, sitting drunk at the table with your mother and brother without anyone else knowing you're drunk. I drank almost everything, beer, wine but mainly hard stuff like vodka for the odor. And I still don't know why but no one ever noticed anything about me being buzzed to drunk all day. I had trained my techniques, drinking vodka, then eating garlic, gum, just putting anything with strong odor for example sauces in my mouth burbling and consuming it. Then a hot shower with a lot of shampoo and brushing my teeth with a lot of toothpaste. Now I was ready for the day, dumbed and buzzed out but therefor less negative thoughts and more good mood and ability to talk, socialize and be funny. Alcohol seemed like a godsend for me, it was my antidepressant and anxiolytic. What a dumb therapy, I didn't think about it in the beginning, some day I recognized how dumb it was but I didn't care as everything, every addiction, every physiological damage I was doing myself, was better than feeling the psychological pain I would experience being sober. I drank mostly daily until I was 19, then I lost my driving licencse because of course drinking that often alcohol was almost always in my blood. It was late night, the morning after I directly quit cold turkey and never began drinking alcohol since ever. Nowadays I can't even drink alcohol anymore, I tried as society (friends, family, just social events) kind of forces one to, BUT I can't enjoy it, it just directly gives me headache, (strangely for alcohol but) bad mood, tiredness and very psychological and physiological unpleasantness in general. This occurs right after one or two sips. Kind of sad, I think sometimes, but probably the best thing for me and my health.

With 20 I discovered **phenibut**, oh yeah. First I was sticking to the very important rule only consuming it twice a week. Then as I went back to university I couldn't stand not being able to socialize again, I wanted to talk to people, make friends, meet girls, be able to impress people and not be branded as the shy, silent, not interesting at all boy in university. It was not only about impressing them but also myself as being this psychologically disabled boy made me very depressive and sad. Another thing was my disabled cognition due to depression. Before phenibut I sat in universiy and didn't understand a thing, I was socially anxious and panicful all the time. I spent much more attention to what this person 3 rows in front of me thinks about me, what the girl sitting 6 rows behind me would think about how I sat, when I would cough or give a strange sound from me. Thanks to phenibut I didn't care, I could focus on the topics, not on the people around me and what they could think about me (even if they don't care anyways, it was very paranoid and irrational thinking). I had the greatest idea, creativity and funny jokes on my mind. I participated a lot in the lectures, group work and projects. I was very social, the people told me I was the most social person they met and that I should stay like this, never change as I was very friendly, funny, even integrating social outcasts or people with mental issues like depression, social anxiety or even Asperer. I wanted the best for everyone and tried my best to give people a good life and confidence as I knew how bad it was for me before phenibut and now I was able to gift people. Well phenibut made me kind of hypomanic as you could imagine. I had the feeling I could do anything, life was amazing, life was heaven. I never worried at all, I was happy all the time. I had great perspectives and ideas all the time. Future was safe for me. I could speak with every person, doesn't matter which age, gender or whatever. I could just go to a girl and flirt with her, change numbers, take her home at partys. I had so many dates, met so many different people and girls. Did so many different things, tried new hobbys, political thinking and engagement, positive thoughts about future jobs, social life etc. Everything worked. What should I have worried about. Sure, also phenibut lost its magic after a year. I struggled with withdrawal for a month very hard. It's no joke at all, it was in comparison to the heaven I experienced on phenibut, a total hell. I experienced a feeling of inner emptiness and restlessness that I wouldn't wish my worst enemy. It was not bearable in these moments that came like for periods of 30mins during the day. There was nothing I could do to against during this pain of hell. Very hard to describe but believe me intense torture without knowing what or where it was coming from or hitting you.

**Today** I'm still studying luckily, I didn't give up but I was very close to. But depression and all these symptoms in the first paragraph are strongly present. Future anxiety is big. What should life bring me being depressive, bad mood, kind of dumb, disabled in thinking and cognition, not being able to socialize or talk. How should I ever manage a job like this, find some people I'm able love and people that love me. How should I find joy in life when nothing stimulates me, nothing interest me, nothing gives me joy? I feel very dumb, disabled, hope- and perspectiveless and bad mood all the time. Additionally many moments are filled with deep psychological pain and inner emptiness or restlessness. Life is a torture but there still is a little spark of hope somewhere. Otherwise I wouldn't continue studying (even if with very bad cognition and not a lot of success) and sometimes socialize (even if after social events I feel very disappointed of myself). I also have a sidejob since 2 months which works quite well and gives me good feelings about myself. On days I work I feel slightly better.

**If you read until here I want to thank you so much for ""hearing"" me.** I would love to read about your experiences, assumptions, suggestions or tips. According therapy, medication, cogntive/behavioral paterns and so on.

I want to **try a new medication** (as I already tried 10, see second paragraph) now in December, I already talked with my doc about it. I also tried almost every supplement there is in the world and many nootropics. My therapy seems quite **therapy resistent** at least according that what I tried. As I already said **I think my depression is mainly biological**. I don't know if it always have been like this as the alcohol could have fucked my brain much too. **In my depth psychological therapy I also learned** that **my older brother** played a big role in messing me and my thought patterns up. I don't want to give him the fault but it makes a lot of sense as he really harmed me psychologically and sometimes physiolgoically and when a thing like this happens daily sure your brain and thought patterns change withit too and not in the positive way. Additionally I grew up with my mother and brother alone, **father was not there** since I was 4. My mother allowed us everything and was a everything-going-to-be-great speaker. Maybe the **austerity and inurement from the father was missing**. Otherwise I was very **not-resilient and socially anxious since I was a small child**. Again: That's why I think the origin/source is biological. I also think the depression arised out my social anxiety and weak resiliance.",1
"Hello I‘m suffering from severe depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old, now I‘m 21.

I already did 2 depth-psychological therapies and am in a behavioral therapy right now. I already tried countless medications: Venlafaxine (Trevilor), Sertraline (Zoloft), Escitalopram (Cipralex), Seroquel (Quetiapine), Promethazin, Paroxetin (Paxil), Wellbutrin (Bupropion) Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Opipramol, Moclobemide and am on Amitriptyline 100mg at night now. Of all meds I reached the highest dose possible and none gave me any effects. I think the amitriptyline has a very little impact on my depression and keeps me from falling into the deepest depression. Additionally it helps me with my sleep but does nothing regarding my social anxiety. 

Right now I‘m a dumbo and abusing phenibut and kratom daily (which also are very subtle to me) as I‘m in an internship which is a must-do for my bachelor degree and without phenibut and kratom I wouldn‘t have done it, came so far or being able to the intern tasks I do here. It‘s still one week to go, after that I‘m going to quit phenibut and kratom and 100% experience withdrawal which will give me deep depression and anxiety again, I‘m sure.

Well I wrote so much about my trials forgetting to mention the point of this post. Social anxiety was and still is the main source of my depression. 

My symptoms are mainly anhedonia (lack of interest, nothing that stimulates me or makes me fun); deep psychologically extremely hurting negative thoughts and feelings of emptiness and that I have failed life and will fail from the moment I open my eyes in the morning; cognitive deficiency (caused by yearlong depression); social anxiety and all its symptoms and restrictions to life (a big problem for me is that I never am able to think about anything to talk about, my head just feels empty and inhibited, as if I had no knowledge, memory or experiences at all); then also psychosomatic pain especially in my back, neck, shoulders. Even walking a bit or just standing, keeping body posture, sitting or walking stairs are incredibly exhausting for me. Social anxiety hinders me to build relationships (friends/romantic), open up or be myself and going out, in short it hinders me from experiencing life and developing. For example I hide in my room when I hear that my roommates are in the kitchen (even if I really have to pee or I‘m hungry as fuck). If friends ask me to do something I always invent excuses because my anxiety and panic grows big. If I‘m walking in the city or somewhere and I see someone in 100 or even more meters coming the same direction to me I’m like paralyzed and thinking about how to act for this one second he will be near by me. Like holy shit crazy unnecessary stuff I can’t control. I think that everyone observes and criticizes me, doesn’t like me, just waits for me doing something wrong and so on and so on. Irrational and exhausting things like that which continuously add up to my low self esteem of course.

And what is a life without humans and social life, without being able to build up real relationships or feel interests, passion or fun. I feel like I don’t have a own personality. I feel like I don’t even know myself. I feel like my future has nothing to give. Life feels like living in a dead body for me. I feel alone, a painful emptiness and as if I have nothing to offer and no worth or skills, nothing. 

How should I even have developed myself or skills not taking part in life because my socially anxious brain hinders me from living, experiencing and by it: developing. It takes me all my self esteem and lust for life being like this. Just because of social anxiety. In short feel like a dumb, mentally and physically retarded, incompetent, always bad mood, antisocial and worthless washout. 

So my question to you, how to continue? How should I ever be able to work a real job like this (depressive, socially anxious and „dumb“), build up true relationships and have true friends and true girlfriends? (With true I mean relationships that I build up because I really wanted, relationships in which I can be myself, have fun and especially finally be able to open up.) How should I some day be a father of a family, feel fun, interest and passion, enjoy life and get through all the challenges and so called „life tasks“ that life will bring?

About my resources:
I‘m 21, in college, no future perspectives because of what I wrote about. I don‘t see myself functioning anywhere...
1. At least I was able to almost get through my bachelor somehow, am in 5th from 6 semester now (even if I took one year break in between). I don’t know where to go or what to do after my bachelor.
2. I have friends and family. But I can‘t be myself, open up or feel fun, even at my closest family members or friends. It all feels so untrue for me. As I said I feel like I don‘t have any personality. Everything feels so unreal, daunting, horrible and painful or just boring. 
3. My physical appearance is no problem to me, without wanting to sound narcissistic I really am a pretty motherfucker (I get this told a lot lot). But this doesn‘t mean anything to me, it has no value, it doesn‘t give me any self esteem at all. I‘m still a mental wrack and slouch. I still feel as if really anybody else is 2000% better than me.
4. I had girlfriends and sex. I’m mentioning this because it was something that really helped me a bit as if I kind of checked this life task off like: Job done!
5. I am really anhedonic but still I produce digital music for Spotify sometimes and people seem to like and support it.
6. Im interested in neurosciences but it’s nothing I could make money with.
7. If you would ask me about my hobbies I would say tennis and skiing.
„Hey see you have interests then“ yes but this is on a very anhedonic way. It still all feels so painfully empty and I’m just not able to feel/get stimulated by any of those things. But I can say that tennis and skiing help me with my negative thoughts for a moment.
7. We aren‘t rich (my parents are divorced btw) but I would say we don‘t have any financial issues.

Thank you so so much if you read until here. I could write on and on. Like how my childhood was, what I have experienced etc etc. but yeah I tried to write down the most important things which could be useful for anyone trying to help. If you need any further information please just leave a comment and ask me anything you want!

What are your suggestions for me?

If you suffered from social anxiety too:
What was your way of losing this horrible disease? Or more: What was your way of becoming more social and talkative, being able to open up and just be yourself. I really just want to be able to talk and talk and talk, have fun socializing, open up to other people and just be myself. Right now it seems like I‘m faking 100% the whole time and that‘s so exhausting and feeling wrong and bad.

My therapy as well as I think social anxiety is really the biggest source of my depression as it hinders me from having social boundaries (which is really important for the human species), living life, going out and just experience things to be able to develop and grow in personality and knowledge. I feel like I kind of stagnated since I was 15 and started to become capable of perceiving my social anxiety and it‘s restriction => so: of course depression, a very low self esteem and restricted not enjoyable life.",1
I’ve been on Trazodone and it has made me more anxious. Currently coming off it and having some yucky withdrawals. My doctor suggested Paxil but I heard some bad things about coming off it. ,1
"Maybe you already read one of my countless posts about my depression and social anxiety. I'm suffering from them since I waas 15. Now I'm 21. It first started with social anxiety, I'd say, then because of the issues the social anxiety gives the depression came and then complete anhedonia, lack of drive, appetite and huge cognitive deficiency making me feel dumb and retarded, mentally as well as physiologically, right now.

And I don't know how to change it, I tried a lot like 10 medications (SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs) and right now on a tricyclic antidepressant called Amitriptyline. I also tried socializing weeks daily but it seems that my brain never gets an aha-effect or wow, this it how it works, my brain just doesn't learn any new patterns or cognitions (according socializing, university, knowledge etc. etc.). I also tried 2x depth psychological therapy and right now I'm in a  behavioral therapy.

The Amitriptyline doesn't work neither. It was my first antidepressant after more than 9 months now, I started it on 20th of December 2020. But I also started abusing Kratom daily since October 2020 and Phenibut since 3 weeks daily now as without it I wouldn't be able to function in the traineeship for my university which I am in right now. I start thinking about maybe those are the reasons I don't get effects from the Amitriptyline. Also regarding the antidepressants I tried before I always was abusing alcohol at first, then some years later phenibut and now kratom daily. The first 4 antidepressants I had I didn't use any substance at all (not even alcohol/nicotine) but I also didn't get any effects. 

All is fucked up: my brain chemistry my thinking my body. I feel retarded and dumb, mentally as well as physiologically. I don't know what to say in social events, I can't open up myself and feel free or be myself. I can't keep or learn new knowledge, I can't focus at all in conversations as well as classes in university. I can't study. I can't stand up in the morning. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I can't make any new friends or make romantic relationships even if all the people I know tell me I'm so good looking but this doesn't touch my self esteem at all. My self esteem, -trust and -value are at zero. I can't find any clear or rational thoughts but countless incredibly painful negative thoughts. And I fuck myself with kratom, phenibut and cigarettes (at least 0.0 alcohol since 2 years and no other drugs). My head and mind feel empty but at the same time over all the place. My hope is getting less and less since I'm fighting since I was 15. I know the reasons due to my depth psychological therapy so this is understood but still nothing changes.

Any suggestions or recommendations for me?

I will continue my behavioral therapy even if never go out with it with knowing something new that helps me. According meds I still have perspective as I think my brain chemistry is so fucked up because of all this years living and thinking like this because of depression and social anxiety. I also know that my depression fucked up my cognition so bad. I already tried: Venlafaxine (Effexor, Trevilor), Escitalopram (Cipralex), Seroquel (Quetiapine), Promethazine => those were the meds I tried without abusing any substance meanwhile. On daily alcohol abuse starting in the morning: Sertraline (Zoloft), Paroxetine (Paxil) => then slowly drifted to phenibut meanwhile on: still Paroxetine (Paxil), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Opipramol, Moclobemide (Aurorix, an MAOI) => now on 4 months Kratom and 3 weeks of phenibut daily: Amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant).

I also heard about amisulpride helping tons with social anxiety (which was the main source of my depression early in the beginning and it would help me tons with my depression if I didn't have social anxiety). My doc also mentioned pregabalin (Lyrica) and gabapentin at some of the last options but I know those are very addictive.

What other meds could I give a try the next time I'm at my doc? I also (naturally) want to quit phenibut and kratom after my traineeship ends in 2 weeks. I just need it for this time somehow. Phenibut I don't take at the weekends, only kratom. So is there any med that would help me with withdrawal and detox at the same time while improving my mood, drive, cognition and helping me with depression?

What is your opinion? Did most of these meds didn't work because of my abuse of other substances at the same time? Otherwise also the first 4 meds I tried didn't have any effect and I wasn't using any other substance than the antidepressant. I feel very bad about thinking this now, of course. My own fault but I just wanted to live at least 20% rather than 0% and these substances allowed me to do so.

I thank you for reading so far! I appreciate very help so so much and give you a big hug! Thank you!",1
"But I hope it will give me the incentive to come off for good.

I've been struggling a lot lately with depression and anxiety and particularly low self confidence and self esteem. To be fair, I've suffered with that my whole life pretty much. But recently it's got to the point where I've had to take time off work to try and deal with it.

It's hard but I'll do my best to learn to cope with it",1
"(cross post with r/BipolarReddit)

Starting in 2009 (age 17), I had increasingly awful depression, reaching a peak in late 2014 (age 22), when I checked myself into hospital for 5 days outpatient then 7 days inpatient. After this, my meds were switched from Paxil and Abilify to Effexor XR. In early 2017 (age 24), after gradually increasing the Effexor, I was bumped to 225mg a day. This sent me into a hypo manic episode for a week until I dropped it back to 150mg. My body couldn't keep up with my mind, I had no filter, and I did things without thinking.

This lead to my psych to change my diagnosis from Major Depressive Disorder to Bipolar Disorder Type 2, rapid cycling, as we believed that this wouldn't have happened if I didn't have bipolar, paired with how I had described my depressive episodes as wave-like/ebbing and growing for years. I added on lithium 300mg 2xday at this time.

Now I'm in a new state and have a new psych (age 25). I went to her last week for Rx refills and because I had the worst short-term depression in years. I couldn't work or even get out of bed for 5 days. She says the the Effexor Lithium combo seems to have helped with some issues (anxiety, bulimia, self-harm), but isn't doing enough for the depression. She upped my Lithium to 300mg 3xday and is seeing me March 13th. Her main issue is that I don't have any issues with sleep during my ""up"" periods. I sleep normally. When I'm depressed, I sleep a lot more and have trouble getting up in the morning.

What my issue is: If I don't have bipolar, what are the other possible disorders I could have? What runs similarly to bipolar but isn't? Is there such thing as cyclical depression? If I don't have bipolar, what the hell was that episode in early 2017? (I asked my new psych something like this when I saw her, but she didn't have an answer for me, just shrugged it off...) 

**I'm not asking that you diagnose me, just what is similar to bipolar**

Edit: Added info",1
"Does anyone here feel like they have been misdiagnosed because of a medication that they’ve been prescribed?

I feel like the industry is set up to fail at effectively treating a patient because they trust the medication more than they trust the patient. 

My story, if you want to read it (not necessary... I really just want to know if people have had experience with this):

I was taking two antidepressants (Zoloft and Wellbutrin). One is known for increasing anxiety and I was struggling while on it. I went to a psychiatrist to help me figure out the right meds for my dysthymia and GAD. 

Psychiatrist took me off both meds and put me on Paxil. Paxil caused mania and I took myself to the hospital because it scared me and I was having impulsive thoughts of self-harm, which is not me AT ALL. I’ve never been suicidal until that day. 

Then he took me off of Paxil and put me on Lamictal. Told me that Paxil hates me and that I am bipolar type 2 (first time anyone has ever said this to me).  I had never, ever had mania in the past. 

Lamictal makes me feel even more out of my mind. I’m unable to sleep, no appetite, no happy thoughts, only thoughts of wanting to die, etc. My senses explode and I can barely wear clothes or handle things even touching me. My muscles are tense all day which is causing bad joint pain. 

I tell the doctor the Lamictal is not working. He then tries the following medications in order without taking me off of anything (except the Xanax). Xanax, Trazadone, Ativan, and finally Zoloft. I begged to be back on Zoloft because I have a long history with it working well. 

I tell doctor I want to get pregnant (which is true) so then I start weaning off 4 medications at this point. I’m almost done. Lamictal has about half a week and then Trazadone. 

If I wouldn’t have been prescribed the anxiety inducing med to begin with, I never would have had to go to a psychiatrist who kept piling medication upon medication on me. 

On top of it all, the psychiatrist doesn’t believe a word that comes out of my mouth. He won’t remove the bipolar diagnosis and doesn’t listen to me when I say I’m not. I guess I don’t know what is going on with my own brain. 

How is it that I go from a fully functioning person who had dysthymia and GAD into a bipolar mess who can barely function in life without having a massive meltdown? I feel like it’s the industry’s fault and I made this post wondering if anyone else has had the same experience. 

Sorry for such a long post.",1
"It’s bad today. Real bad

This depression, anxiety, PTSD, possibly Bipolar (that diagnosis is new, made from a psychiatrist with whom I’ve had a single one hour session and the majority of it was her telling me that we won’t be a good fit) ... 

I’ve been up all night shaking and sobbing uncontrollably. I’m broken. I’m a burden on my friends. No family because both parents died (cancer and stroke).

— no therapist so no emergency number to call for counseling. And yes I’ve tried counseling. The first place, I went through EIGHT in a year because their work environment was so hostile (bad management) that they kept quitting. The eighth one was verbally abusive. The second clinic: I liked my therapist but I missed 3 sessions in a row so they dropped me as a patient. Why did I miss sessions? I was 1300 miles away tending to my mother who suffered a stroke and was in a vegative state, absolutely no brain activity and I had to make the decision to take her off life support alone because I’m an only child. Her body stayed alive (zero brain activity beyond breathing) for nearly two weeks before dying. I told the therapist where I was and why. I begged for help navigating my mother’s slow death. They still dropped me 

— ERs around here only care if you’re suicidal. If you’re not, they kick you out. They make zero attempt to help you find real help; one nurse literally said that it’s not the hospital’s fault that I can’t find a decent therapist. She discharged me ten minutes later 

— the only people I know who have first hand knowledge haven’t responded to my pleas for help(I’ve asked to talk to them several times with no response). They probably hate me anyway. 

I just want to be better, be normal. I just want help.

To be clear, not suicidal. I just want to feel normal again. I want my life back. I want to feel like I matter


Medications:
Xanax: 1mg twice a day

Lamitcal: 50 mg once a day

Paxil: 60 mg once a day",1
I’m a 20yo male who after a week stay in inpatient care at a hospital has been court ordered to outpatient care and it’s really scaring me. My anxeity and depression are through and room and as far as I can tell have only gotten worse since my commitment. The program I go to starts Tuesday and idk what to do. My meds have been changed and it is really affecting me. I used to be on Paxil and kolonopin the latter being 2mgs a day and they cut me off cold turkey on both and put me on Prozac nuerotin and Minipress. I feel utterly hopeless and afraid I have been getting horrible headaches and heart palpitations. My pulse is almost always around 100 and I have lost hope. If anyone has any advice or encouragement I’d be extremely grateful. ,1
"TL;DR at the bottom <3

ALSO **\*\*MILD TRIGGER WARNING\*\*** I'm actually not entirely sure, but just in case, paragraph 4(yikes, this was supposed to be a quick question, not a novel), just before the bullet points is a quick note about suicidal ideation. 

My partner went psychotic back in October, and I was fully in charge, and after a few months of care, he's finally back at work as of this week and following treatment for BP. 

I'm a bit worried about myself because I just started treatment for OCD, and I've had a couple of low points. My psychiatrist said I should stop Paxil(only 13 days), but since I'm traveling for work, we decided it's safer if I take a smaller dose until we meet next week.

Because what I was feeling was rather odd(crying, fear of being anxious again when I stop the medication, feeling selfish and greedy for eating meat multiple times a week, wanting to smash my phone when I'm frustrated, headaches), and also because I will probably be put on a different treatment when I see him, and thus go through other rounds of symptoms, I realized I'm not prepared in case of a mental health emergency, and that it might be a good idea to leave instructions for my partner, as well as my sister and how to inform my parents who live outside of the US.

When I woke up this morning, I felt it was silly to want to make that plan, until my heart started racing again, and my eyes were puffy and I felt a headache coming in. I don't think I'm going to die, but I can imagine the quirky ideas I'm having where I, the meat lover, start feeling bad about eating cows and fish, start feeling selfish for eating meat, or when I have graphic ideas on how taking my life if things happen to my mom. I won't act on the suicidal bit, I know it's my OCD being a dick. 

Essentially, I just want:

* My partner to know where to find the note(he's still forgetful),
* My partner to follow steps on how to inform my sister so she doesn't worry and drive crazy(hevenucamembert is fine, she had a mental health crisis and asked me to share this with you. She's a planner and left instructions for you as well). And also fill out an FMLA and disability form ASAP. I don't want this to be my life, but at the same time, when my partner was hospitalized, I had know idea what the eff an FMLA was, or how to make sure he'll keep his job. Better safe than sorry.
* How my sister should inform my parents without affecting their health(they're older and sick), because I call my parents every day, and they'd know something is up.
* Make sure my parents' bills are paid on time if I end up staying longer than necessary
* Make sure my pup and kitty are fed

Have you prepared anything in writing in case you have a mental health emergency, with instructions on how to treat you, and how to inform your family, what bills to pay etc? If so, do you hide it, or leave a post it on where to find it? I don't feel comfortable leaving it on my computer, but then again, maybe I should email it to my partner

So, TL;DR, Scared of treatment in case of ER, and want my partner and my sister to follow my exact instructions if it ever were to happen, and would like your thoughts on how/where to leave instructions

"i have had anxiety and depression my whole life and was prescribed paxil a few years back. i’ve recently started seeing a real psychiatrist during a rather severe depressive episode where i was diagnosed with an NOS mood disorder and put on wellbutrin and abilify. i’m feeling really down about having to take all of these new medications. i feel weak, and sometimes even feel worried that maybe i’ve been faking it this whole time and am taking all of these for no reason? idk lol",1
"Hello everyone!

Lately I’ve found that the logistics of day-to-day activities have been so overwhelming that they prevent me from enjoying the activities. When I go out somewhere, I always ask myself, “Is there enough gas in the car? Is there enough money for food and whatever trinket we may want to buy? Do we have the energy to drive back and forth?” and a dozen other questions geared toward addressing every possible contingency so that everyone can have a good time. 

Normally this is not a problem. I’m very happy to handle all the logistics myself so that nobody else has to worry and everyone else can have a good time. Recently though, my girlfriend’s empathy has seen through my tactics. She senses when I’m not having a good time and that makes her feel bad. With my exes, with my friends, and with my family, I can distract, feint, and parry so that nobody notices my mood. Not with my girlfriend. 

We’re both employed full time. She hates her job. We never have enough money and we never have enough time to do the neverending list of chores we have. I do make a dent in the chores when I can and I pay all the bills, which often leaves me poorer and sadder and more stressed than she is. 

Both my girlfriend and I have a history of taking anti-anxiety medication as prescribed. I regard ever taking medication for anxiety as the biggest mistake of my entire life. Let me say that again for all of you: **taking anti-anxiety meds was the biggest mistake of my life.** 

Paxil, Lexapro, and Luvox claimed to better my life, but in fact ruined it. I am 29 now and I took these medications as a teenager. I am only just now rebuilding from the wreckage of my life on those drugs. I still experience the side effects of these  drugs over ten years later: sexual dysfunction, lethargy, apathy, dry mouth, and tachycardia still pose stumbling blocks for me. I’ve asked doctors about this and they tell me that side effects from anti-anxiety meds can be lifelong.

The worst side effect from anti-anxiety meds is that the people who know that I used them (my parents) no longer trust me. I sometimes try to tell them when I feel nervous or I try to ask them for advice, but when I admit to nervousness or sadness or anything, they tell me, “Wow, it sounds like you need to go back on drugs.”

When I try to help them, they refuse. They tell me, “You needed drugs to handle life before. We wouldn’t want to burden you now. You are fragile.” It’s gotten to the point where only my girlfriend knows about my history with Luvox, Paxil, and Lexapro. To everyone else I deny ever using those medicines. Gaslighting isn't bad when it is an act of self-preservation.

These days I am proudly unmedicated. I do get worried and stressed as I mentioned above. However, there are some moments some days when I realize how lucky I am. I feel like everything will work out. I feel so grateful for my girlfriend and I realize that being honest about my emotions isn’t bad. And I also realize this: without those moments of terrible anxiety, I wouldn’t have these moment of calmness and serenity. 

Have hope everyone! There’s more than one solution to your problems!

When getting of Paxil how long does hot flash’s last and intolerance to high temperature stop ,1
After 6 months of having severe anxiety my Doctor prescribed me Paxil. I’m concerned that if I start taking it I’m never going to learn how to manage my anxiety on my own and I’m scared that if I stop taking it then my anxiety will get worse. Any advice? ,1
"So i use to be on 20mg of paxil for 3 years. Then i went up to 40. I ended up stopping when i left florida as my pshyc cant send meds out of state. 

I saw a new primary (pshyc are months out here) and he put me on seroquel and thinks i am bipolar and was manic at the time. 

I been on seroquel almost 2 months now. It helped the depression but not with the anxiety much. I also been having major health anxiety all day and a few panic attacks. I take propanolol and it helps a little bit . So now he asked if i want to try Paxil again  to see if it helps with the anxiety and health anxiety and i said yes. He said theres a very low chance of it sending me manic with me being on the seroquel. 

He prescribed 10Mg and as soon as i took it i started getting a panic attack thinking im manic again as when i was manic it was 24/7 panic attacks. 

I am super scared and dont know what to do. I feel im manic again but i think its just my bad anxiety telling me its manic. ",1
",",1
"I was prescribed Paxil a month ago but just started taking it 2 days ago. I was prescribed 10mg. So I’ve only taken the pill twice. I have severe ocd, anxiety, depression. Ya know all that good stuff. These past two days have been great. I am a SAHM to 2 toddlers. I have been able to laugh and enjoy the small moments and not feel like a mess. Although I am still experiencing some anxiety and intrusive thoughts but not nearly like I was before. I have been reading about Paxil and it’s withdrawal. My doctor never mentioned anything about it. And I am freaking out now. I never wanted to stay on something long term. I just needed something to help me out for a bit. My bf works on the road. I am alone with my kids all the time. I am worried now that if I were to go off of it I’d get terrible withdrawal symptoms that im reading can last a year and I can’t go through that. I have two kids that depend on me. I can’t not be okay. Can I just stop taking it since it’s such a low dose and it’s only been 2 days? Will I get hit with terrible withdrawal symptoms? This morning I woke up in a pissy mood and immediately wanted to take the medication because it does make me feel so much happier but I don’t want to experience any withdrawal if I ever forget to take it or want to come off of it. I am so upset that my doctor didn’t warn me about this. I’m reading everywhere that it’s a terrible medication. ",1
"Hey guys, so it's been 10 days I've been off paxil after 14 day of use. I'm getting chest hotness inside and my body is hot any recommendations or what to do? Im even  taking valiums 5mg  and it's not helping me i stopped taking propranolol 10mg cause i started having shortness of breath i still have shortness of breath",1
"Has anyone with chronic stomach knot anxiety experienced relief with paxil? I've tried other antidepressants and even benzos. While they have helped some of the mental symptoms, none of them really touched the physical anxiety. I'm hesitant to try paxil due to the horrid apparant side effects and potential for difficult withdrawal, but if it helps with this I am willing to sacrifice. ",1
"I’ve contemplated for a long time about going on medication again. For some context, when I was 14 and had major depression I tried Prozac, Zoloft, and Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin didn’t do much for me, but Prozac and Zoloft messed me up badly. I was already depressed of course, but those two medications made me extremely suicidal to be honest. I dropped out of high school, started drinking and it was a whole mess.

I’m now 22 and I have minor and short episodes of depression, but my anxiety is quite bad. I have panic attacks fairly often (maybe once every 1-2 weeks). My throat will feel closed up for months at a time, sometimes I have difficulty unclenching my jaw as well. I also have been picking my skin on my ears and around my fingernails (all my life but it’s gotten worse).

I feel I’ve tried my hardest to work around this without medication (therapy, breathing techniques etc.) but it’s just not working. My anxiety is very hereditary. I’m asking about Paxil specifically because both my mom and grandma have been taking it for 20 years+ and they say it drastically changed their lives, so maybe it would work well for me? I am very afraid of going on an SSRI again to be honest… just wondering what has worked for you guys. Medications or techniques, really any advice is appreciated! ",1
Lexapro and paxil both caused worsened anxiety and constant panic attacks. I had a lot of anxiety before but no panic attacks ever until taking these meds. I haven't even been able to work for 2 weeks. I need my life back. I was taking paxil for about 3 weeks,1
"Has anyone had this combination? It’s been about 4 days or so and I feel pretty good while on it… a bit weird sometimes it’s hard to explain, not necessarily brain fog but maybe??? I’m just wondering what I should do after my 7 days of klonopin is out bc that’s all I was prescribed but I feel normal with these two combined. I’m hoping the Paxil works its magic and helps me continue feeling normal and less panicky. ",1
"Im cutting paxil gradually by taking 12.5 after 2 month of using 25. , now i feel body electricity in my brain and my mouth. , this feeling really make me worry. , if any one had this experience please tell me its will be gone ",1
"I've severe anxiety and got prescribed Paroxetine, at what does it helped you ? ",1
"I was prescribed 10mg but I felt like it made my anxiety worse after taking it (I took for 2 days straight) I haven’t taken it since and I feel like absolute shit, I’m sad, I have negative thoughts, bad dreams, I couldn’t sleep, I wanted to cry because I haven’t felt like that in years. Is this how it makes you feel if you miss a day or two? Has anyone else been through this before? I’ve been taking buspar for way longer I’m at max dose (I took them together) but I’m not sure if I wanna deal with that if Paxil is gonna make me feel like hell for missing 2 days ",1
"hi! so i’m on paxil 10mg and have only been on it for a week. it’s been causing me terribly physical symptoms including increased heart rate, severe nausea, and occasional vomiting. i haven’t been able to sleep that well and it’s been hard to eat.

my doctor told me to stop taking it and just take the hydroxyzine 10mg i have until i see him again next month. is this safe? again, ive only been on 10mg for 1 week but i’m terrified of having worse symptoms than i already have being on it.

please help.",1
"hi all. i currently take paxil. i have for about 4 months. i notice that if i forget it once or twice, i feel like a walking corpse. i also notice recently ive gotten dizzy, nauseous, etc. even when i do take it. i’ve ruled out diabetes, i have no symptoms or anything alarming that could be it. im not sure what else it could be, so im strongly considering its my meds. oddly enough, if i don’t take my meds and i eat, i feel like crap & i still feel like my stomachs empty. which again, i thought i was diabetic. does anyone have any advice for a different medication? im thinking about some but im so anxious to wean off of paxil. i dont want to feel like crap anymore. not to mention, i either feel so so emotional or no emotion at all. i’m tired. (this med makes me exhausted.) i have some brain fog, sometimes i get heart palpitations too but i believe that’s my anxiety. my heart was checked and it’s healthy. anyway, thank you guys. ",1
"Been on it for 3 weeks, seemed to be improving until the last few days I barely eat & I wake up on the verge of a panic attack every day. I’ve read Paxil can sometimes make you worse before better so not sure if I should stick with it or not? ",1
I’m not sure people can take this. I took this for 2 days and slept for 2 days. I have no appetite. I haven’t ate AT ALL!! It’s been 2 days since I’ve taken it and I’m still out of it. My mental health is worse than it was. I go from one emotion to the next. I feel like I’m on 🍄. I have to rock myself to sleep. I feel horrible!! I can feel it slowly leaving my system but I thought it would be gone by now. I can barely function. My eyes are extremely low. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m 5’4 and 115 pounds or because I started on 20 mg but this is not for me. ,1
"hi all. 2-3ish months ago, i began to take Paxil. so far so good, but since i started taking it i get nauseous, kinda dizzy, just overall sometimes dont feel good. does anyone else take this medication and has side effects or possible side effects even after months of taking it? i’m only on 10mg. i dunno if it’s my meds or my body’s mad at me. any advice or suggestions?",1
I’ve been tapering Paxil for three years and at .7mgs but withdrawal symptoms have been a lot lately. I’ve heard Prozac is easier to get off of. Anyone have experience with this? ,1
"Been on Paxil 10mg for 9 months, used to take 20mg Lexapro, it was good for first few months, but when u have period of anxiety and stress, like now the rumination got worst and also seems like restless leg syndrome of sorts. I tried going up to 15 mg Paxil , maybe thinking the 10 wasn’t working and felt like I was on meth , every morning at 4;00 am I wld walk around the house, major anxiety . So goin to switch back to lexapro 20mg ! Cross tapering 5mg Paxil to 10mg lexapro at first! ",1
"I started 10 mg of Paxil 6 days ago. Anxiety, depression,insomnia all got worse. Then twitching and brain zaps. Dr just told me to discontinue the medicine. Am I ok to stop after 6 days or will I have withdrawal? Should I taper? ",1
"I have had debilitating anxiety with horrible thoughts and shakiness occurring each morning before opening my eyes.  I cannot bare it.  Went to ER with full blown pain attack.  Told to continue taking Paxil. Today is day 6.  Increased it from 10 mg to 20 as of yesterday. Gabe me Ativan 0.5. Honestly, I feel like that should be helping more than it is. I take it once I feel the extreme anxiety and can get back to sleep for an hour or so but then wake up with shakiness and definitely anxiety I would hope would be reduced with such a strong medication.  Maybe Ativan doesn’t really work for. Me.. Will ask to switch until the Paxil starts to work more effectively.  I”ve never in my entire life felt like this.  I’ve heard of being anxious but this is on a whole new level and you cannot function.  Any stories like this… HOPEFUL ONES!!!!",1
"
I got a story to tell. I first began taking paxil in '97. I was 16 years old. Since the age of 7, I experienced the occasional panic attack after a house fire that forced my family and I to be homeless a few months.

Fast forward 10 yrs, I was a young adolescent hanging out with the wrong crowd. I had a really bad trip smoking weed and within 2 weeks my anxiety got so bad I couldn't make it to school. Eventually this lead to agoraphobia where I couldn't even make it to the hallway of my building to throw out the garbage. I felt hopeless. My mother found me a psychiatrist who I went to for a few months and prescribed me anti anxiety medication (don't remember which) but nor medication or therapy was working. I was deteriorating as a 16 yr old boy who was always outdoors with friends. After 6 months of being house bound, my mother found another psychiatrist who was a lot closer to help with my agoraphobia. Our first visit he mentioned paxil and said this is a fairly new medication but seems to be getting a lot of positive results. My mother asked can he guarantee this will help and he said no. I began crying due to the hopelessness I've been feeling the past 6 months. 
After a few weeks on paxil, I started to notice my anxiety wasn't as bad. And little by little I grew the courage to walk outside. I would go up 1 block and come home. 2 blocks the next day. Eventually would take the bus and the train again. Everything was feeling back to normal and I was so grateful. 

Here's where my story changes, after a few months on paxil, I noticed I would get really aggressive and angry. I wanted to fight everyone. I was outside actually looking for problems. I would give people dirty looks on purpose so I can start a fight. One day I was walking behind a man and I felt the urge to hit him in the back of the head. Violence was all I was fantasizing about. I brought this to my dr.s attention who said, ""really? That shouldn't be happening. It should be doing the opposite. Let's up your dose""

I was put on 40mg of paxil. I became an animal. At 17 yrs old everyone in my neighborhood feared me. I would carry guns and pull it out whenever I argued, in and out of jail for fighting, assaults, robberies, car theft...and eventually attempted murder. 

I spent 5 years in prison. During my time upstate, paxil began getting multiple lawsuits against them and it turned out paxil shouldn't be given to kids. Knowing this you would think I'd get off it. But going through withdrawal symptoms in prison is the last thing you want to do. So I waited until I came home and took me a few months to wane myself off. I've been off paxil since 2007. Recently going through some really bad debilitating anxiety that I'm considering going back on it. I remember how paxil gave me the confidence while other medications didn't. And even though it led me down a violent spiral, my anxiety and panic were almost nonexistent. 

Got a lot of thinking to do....",1
"Would it be bad to just suddenly stop Paxil? I’ve been taking the lowest dose but I just don’t think it’s for me, I’ve only been taking for two weeks so I don’t know it would cause any harm to go cold Turkey ",1
"I’ve been on Paxil for about 15 years, I’m now 35 yrs old. The past 6 months I’ve tried other meds and had no relief so returned to Paxil and my anxiety is now manageable. About week three into switching back to Paxil I started having horrible jaw clenching and eye issues from it. Nothing seems to be helping. It’s now been about a month of this and I’m beyond frustrated, any ideas, did this get better for you? I didn’t have this when I was on it in the past. ",1
I kind of already know since I was on it 10 years ago but it's just been so long I feel like I forgot. My psychiatrist wants me on it again and I just took my first dose 30 min ago. Did it help ya'll? Short term? Long term? Right now I mostly feel calm like my anxiety and feelings are there but far away if that makes sense. My thoughts feel slower too. ,1
"hello reddit! I was recently prescribed paroxetine (paxil) 10mg due to SAD/GAD, as well as dpdr and health anxiety; however, I've been so scared to take it considering its rep. I know I should just try it, but all of the side effects are making me worried (serotonin syndrome, brain zaps??), that it would be more difficult to get off it if I need to versus continuing to live/think the way I do.. I feel like I've been tricking my mind into thinking I feel okay without any medication and my anxiety hasn't been as bad lately, but I still feel anxiety symptoms (brain fog, feeling dizzy/lightheaded, arm tightness, racing thoughts, etc.) Should I ask my doctor to switch my prescription to zoloft first as it seems to be one of the more ""safe"" SSRIs (ofc it depends from person to person), or should I try paxil first? any feedback is appreciated!",1
"Yesterday I got diagnosed with ptsd and anxiety. Dr prescient me 5mg of paxil and Ativan. I've take Ativan previously so I'm not worried about that. Yesterday was the first time I've ever heard of paxil so I read up on it and now I'm extremely nervous. Hoping to hear the good and bad about it! 

Previously I have taken prozac, Celexa, Zyprexa, abilify. I'm allergic to all of them except the peozac. Prozac gave me extreme migraines",1
I’ve never taken any type of medication for my anxiety or panic attacks BUT Lorazepam and that’s for “emergency’s only.” My doctor suggested 20mg Paroxetine daily. I’ve only been taking it for two days now - I can’t tell if it’s making me feel like shit,1
"it’s so frustrating coming on to an ANXIETY subreddit and seeing benzos being stigmatized. 

*TW* suicidal ideation

i’m a 22 year old high school and college dropout due to severe panic disorder, agoraphobia, and GAD. i have never held a steady job. i live my life convinced i’m going to die daily. i wake up panicky, and a lot of times i go to sleep wondering if i’ll die during it. my panic attacks are atypical— they last for hours, coming in waves. i have lost substantial amounts of weight during bad “flareups”. i have had severe suicidal ideation because the thought of taking my own life seemed easier than living in constant fear. i have been on Prozac, Lexapro, Celexa, Zoloft, Paxil, Pristiq, Cymbalta, Lamotrigine, Abilify, Risperdal, Seroquel, Zyprexa, and a couple more off label medications since i was 12. i have tried EMDR, CBT, IOP, and have been inpatient. i’ve seen a therapist since i was 10. so please, don’t you dare tell me that there’s no place for benzos when they’re the only things that make me feel normal.

i started taking 1 mg lorazepam as needed when i was 12. i hardly took it; drug addiction runs in my family. but living was a struggle. as i developed and became more mature, my anxiety got substantially worse. i was prescribed 7 pills every 3 months. however, when the pandemic hit and i was in my psychiatrist’s office shaking inconsolably, i was given 1 pill a day to keep me out of emergency rooms, since that is where my panic attacks would often make me end up. for the first time in a long time, i felt normal. i started my first job as a doordasher. on benzos, i felt like any other 20 something with their whole life ahead of them. for the first time, i saw what it was like to live without fear. 

in the last 2 and a half years, i have built a tolerance and my dose has had to be upped by another mg. however, i fight every day to take less than the dosage given. i’m exhausted because i spend all of my time convincing myself i’m not going to die. but when i finally give in and take what i’m prescribed, i feel like i can do anything a normal person can do.

i’m terrified of withdrawal, of course i am. but my psychiatrist (who is seeing that the medicinal options are starting to run out), decided that giving me daily benzos would give me a substantially better quality of life. it is not ideal. of course it’s not. he made that clear as well. i know about the scary withdrawals and the memory loss (which i thankfully haven’t really experienced) that comes from long term use. give me a different option and i’ll try anything. 

but you know what? if this is what i need to live a fulfilled life, then fuck it. this is what i’ll do. since on it, i’ve been able to travel without my parents, earn my own money, enjoy my life, and cultivate a healthy relationship. i’m tired of how stigmatized benzos are. i’m tired of coming onto this subreddit and seeing how they’re the devil’s drug— worse than heroin and feeling guilty for needing it. 

trust me, nobody would choose this. but i’d rather live a shorter fulfilled life needing benzos than live a long life filled with constant fear and anxiety.",1
"Hello i was using paxil 20 mg seroxat company, now in my country they dont have it , only Orion 20 mg paxil. Im sensitive to meds, will i feel like its other meds? I mean i need to change brand name",1
"Hello, in on paxil 20 mg for 13 months already, it helped me alot, i feel 100 % good.  When i stopped smoking weed after 12 years daily cold turkey it messed me that i get anxiety, it was mild (high hr, palps, depresed it was bearable ) then there was a birthday party of my friend and i drink alot of strong alcohol, and used 2-3 lines of white, all was good i went home and went sleep, i wake up at night because of my heart rate 150-180 maybe more but it felt crazy, it was my first panic attack. And after this it went really bad, i was having panic attacks daily, i tried to recover myself for 1 month but its only get worse, anxiety was unbearable, all symptoms you name it, i was loosing my mind, i couldnt function at all. And then I realised that i need proffesional help, and they put me on paxil. First day of paxil use, it was a nightmare, i literally almost went insane ( not sure or its common) thanks god doc prescribed me a xanax to cope, my mother gave me half xany  and i felt a sleep next day was  better. (It was 0.25 mg of xanax)  i had alot of symptoms from paxil but they all faded away with  some time , the only one i have now its that im not gettin horny , like sex is not interesting for me,  everything works, i can ejeculate etc, not sure how to name it probably low libido , and also i feel sleepy when i need to drive  alot on a highway lol.  I was working with therapy,  back to work, gym,  fix my eating , sleeping habits,  dont do caffeine at all
Any kind, the only bad habit now i have its cigarettes. I feel good, so my doctor decide that we need to start tapering soon, but i read alot about ads and not sure or hes tapering plan ok, and also im not sure or im ready , will i feel okay without it? My pills are 20 mg , so he tells me to make 25% cuts,  20>15>10>5    Every 4-6 weeks. I read alot
About 10% tapering but im not able to do it with 20 mg pills, its also a struggle to make it to quarters.  What you think guys?",1
"Hi everyone, I’d appreciate any advice from people who’ve dealt with a similar issue, I’ll try to keep it as brief as I can:

-started on Paxil 20mg at 16 after having intense anxiety and depression, OCD and panic attacks.
-it worked great and I stayed on that pill until 2017 or so.
-a couple times when I ran out of prescriptions I started going through w/d which is a fate I wouldn’t wish on anyone.
-I am a highly sensitive person so I can typically feel the slightest changes to my brain chemistry and need very small doses of meds to feel their fx.
-in 2017 I decided I wanted to try to get off paxil bc I want to get pregnant one day and the side effects of taking it while pregnant and also the withdrawal did not sit well with me.
-I talked to a psych and they started me on Prozac.
-I got the liquid version of both meds and titrated over about 2-3 months. It actually went really well for a while except that I couldn’t drink coffee on Prozac and drinking wine on it made me physically ill (both are fine on Paxil, I assume bc Prozac is geared more towards depression it gives u a bit of a “buzz” as a pick me up so doesn’t mesh well with these substances, at least for me).
-I was actually completely off paxil for a week or two before the floor totally dropped out from under me and I started feeling intense panic/withdrawal symptoms. It was paralyzing- I couldn’t leave the house, I felt manic, it was awful. I went back on the Paxil and everything went back to normal.
-however, I tried to go back to a lower dose, since I had the liquid form still. I basically just titrated back until I felt normal again and stopped- that was at 16mg.
-since then, for the past five years or so, I’ve been on the liquid formation, taking 16mg. Unfortunately, they don’t make the pill in 15mg form and I’m worried splitting a 10 won’t provide the same Amt in each pill half to reliably take 15mg.
-additionally, I tried to switch back to the pill before titrating back up on the liquid when I restarted after trying Prozac, and the 20mg pill felt way stronger than it needed to be, that’s partially why I went back to the liquid form instead.
-now, it’s years later and I’m hoping to start a family in the next 1-3 years. Again, I would prefer to be off paxil when I’m pregnant.
-I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place and would appreciate any advice, as I see only a few options: (1) stay on Paxil during pregnancy and take the risk my baby/ies will develop congenital heart defects; (2) go off paxil onto a diff drug- but to do this takes months, and I’m not sure it wouldn’t interfere with work (either the side effects from withdrawal or from starting a new antidepressant). How do people do this? I can’t take a leave of absence every time I try to get off this drug. Also, which antidepressant would I even switch to? Prozac obviously doesn’t work, and I think Zoloft is geared towards depression exclusively. Paxil works really well for me, but I don’t want to feel like I’m addicted to this drug forever.
-lastly, obviously I’d start working with a psychiatrist but my experience with them in general has been that they are there to manage your meds, not talk. I feel like I’d need to see one- and the right one- for months to establish trust before I would feel like they knew me well enough to make an educated suggestion at a new drug plan for me. Does anyone have experience with this?",1
"I started Paxil a couple years ago along with finasteride and propranolol. Since then, when I start to sweat I go from nothing to my clothes are soaked within seconds it seems (no joke. It’s super embarrassing). It’s like Niagara Falls coming out of me and I don’t know how to not sweat like a pig at work",1
"Hello,  today is 12 months of my paxil 20 mg
Journey, started 10 mg first weeks then went up to 20 mg. First 6-8 months was tricky , i had some bad episodes of anxiety , heart poudings. It usually went away after 5-7’days.
Now last 4 months i didnt had any long lasting or serious anxiety bouts, so my doctor decides  it’s  time to start taper and offers me a 25% method , splitting 20 mg pills and stop using them in 1
Month period. Basically every 5-7 days taper 25%. Being a year in this group i found her way of taper a bit rushed and drastic, especially with paxil. So the conclusion, i have 80 pills 20 mg. What i should do? (Probabbly i wont get more because she is pretty serious about her taper method) for clarity i stopped smoking weed after 12 years and as result
I get  racing heart, anxiety , adrenaline rush 24/7 and all other symptoms it was so bad i couldnt  function  and was about to go insane and paxil fixed it. ( also while being in this weed withdrawal anxiety i used once alot of alcohol and a bit of other drug like coke and after this it messed me even more) in my early 20s i had some alcohol bouts and drugs, so i could tell you this life style wasnt helping either . Now im 27 years old, will i be able to feel ok without paxil? And how should i taper having 80 pills.  Sorry for bad english",1
"Anyone ever take Paxil and get chest pain? I’m two weeks off of it and had chest pain two weeks prior to getting off of it. It’s wild. I think SSRI’s mess with my heart for some reason, Lexapro gave me heart palps. Anyone experience anything like this?",1
So I’m a hypochondriac which makes it bad enough. I’m absolutely mortified of dying and I’ve been taking Paxil to help me with this. Recently I ran out and I’ve been desperately trying to find a psychiatrist and it’s hard. I’ve been without it for about 4 days now. I feel the usual withdrawal symptoms and I just finally got a refill on my prescription. I did some research on Paxil withdrawal and I’m genuinely mortified. Everyone is saying it’s dangerous to go cold Turkey. I even read that someone picked up a guy who was having a seizure from his withdrawals. I don’t plan on quitting cold Turkey but even to taper off??? People are saying it’s horrible. I’m so so so afraid of dying as it is and I was never warned about this when I was initially put on Paxil. I’m angry and frustrated and scared. I don’t want to be on Paxil anymore but I don’t want to fucking die? Like I’m genuinely mortified. Any suggestions? Do you guys think I’ll die or have a seizure from quitting Paxil? This is gonna send me down a spiral I can feel it.,1
"Anyone been in a full state of agitation when starting Paxil? I wouldn’t call it a panic attack, it was extreme restlessness with malaise. Crazy feeling, still slightly there from about six hours ago. It was strong for about 2-1/2 hours and has gone from 100% down to 10% if I could put a percent on it. 

Anyone else ever feel rough starting Paxil?",1
I am an avid weed and CBD smoker for my anxiety.  My psychiatrist has recently transitioned me off of Celexa and onto Paxil.  But with Paxil I get light headed and nauseous when I smoke.  Has anyone had this experience?  Will I continue to get nauseous and lightheaded when I smoke or will my body likely adjust?,1
"Hi, im using paxil for 9 months , it helped with panic attacks, anxiety (cripple couldnt live) my
Psych tell me to start weening already , from 20 mg to 10 mg instantly cut by half, yesterday  i wanted to start weening took 10 mg (half of pill) but after 20 min i took again half so i consumed my normal dose but with the 20’min delay not full pill at the time like i used to. (I afraid i cant work while weening off cause of symptoms so i want start weening on my 2 months holiday) and this night i felt weird , palps some anxiety,nightmares  (i didint felt like this like for months) is it possible that i felt this way cause i took my pill not at once or its just coincidence because sometimes
Bad days happens",1
"Anyone having experience with paxil before? Do your sex drive become normal?

I am worried about it",1
was just wondering what i could take when the paxil isnt working,1
"I’m taking 5mg Paxil since the 13th I was prescribed 20 but anytime I take over 5 I get horrible gi issues. I’ve developed an aversion to food so that along with the gi issues is making me feel week and dizzy and giving me panic attacks. I don’t know what to do. The only time I feel normal is first thing in the morning. By noon I start sobbing and having multiple panic attacks that last until night. I don’t know if I should keep taking the Paxil but I’m scared to take it, I’m scared to eat. I’ve been surviving off of a bowl of cereal in the morning and bites of white bread downed with water. What do I do?",1
"I got 10mg paxil added onto my 225 mg effexor and after starting it the first 2 or 3 weeks I had no anxiety but it's coming on my 4th week and the past few days been having constant pressure in chest and heartburn etc, is this normal with paxil?",1
Im kinda scared I have been Zoloft 50mg for about 9months. It h lied in the beginning but these last two months have been very rough on me. Baisically i haven’t been able to relax most days. This week I dropped from 50mg to 25mg of Zoloft and I am finally able to nap something that I wasn’t able to do but at the same time o feel dizzy and have headache. I am scared of starting Paxil because of the horror stories,1
"Prepare yourself for some literal shit talk….

So last week (and perhaps for some time before then) I had become rather lax with taking my Paxil every day. I would say I would remember about every other day. Then, the Sunday a week and a half ago — it started. 

After dinner. Almost exactly 30 minutes. I had to shit my brains out. We’re talking whatever comes after 7 on the Bristol Stool Chart. 

This went on for a week. No other symptoms. I could eat any other meal with no ill effects. But, if I consumed anything more substantial than toast for dinner - poop time. 

This was until it occurred to me that I am supposed to be regularly taking an SSRI (this occurred to me as I was blowing up my cousin’s dorm’s bathroom. Many thanks to him and his roommates and I’m deeply sorry) and serotonin services to regulate most GI functions so maybe things were connected and I was doing this to myself. 

This week I have been much more diligent about taking my meds and things are… solidifying into place. Even if the alarm bells are still ringing 30 minutes after dinner. 

I came to ask what your experience with forgetting to take your SSRIs was like, and if you thought that’s what happened to me",1
Hey guys. Just started on 10mg of Paxil two days ago and I’m noticing that my pupils are super dilated from it. Called the doc waiting to here back still. Wondering if this is normal or if anyone else has experienced this? Thanks!,1
"I have been an anxious person my whole life and im really tired of it.  I want to know what it’s like to not live in fear and anxiety.  Lately I have been struggling with some really bad insomnia, health anxiety, and weight loss.  My doctor prescribed Paxil 10mg and told me to start on 5mg because I am pretty sensitive to meds.

Im so terrified of side effects, specifically permanent sexual side effects and worsening insomnia.  I’m also terrified of how hard it will be to come off of them.  

After reading all about Paxil, I thought about lying to my doctor and saying it didn’t work, Then requesting something like Trazadone for insomnia.  

 I really could use some words of encouragement and positive experiences with Paxil",1
"I've been on 40mg of paxil for about 9 months..I started it at a low time in my life and due to the side effects (weight gain, mood change, no sex drive) I decided to begin to taper off. After 3 weeks I'm down to 20mg and I can really feel the effects. I have bad headaches almost all day, I'm fatigued, and I can't focus. Plus my anxiety is through the roof. Any suggestions for getting through this time? ",1
"This next big chunk of text is me venting about my anxiety so feel free to gloss over this lol

I got prescribed Paxil when I was 15 and stayed on it for 6 years. I decided to taper off last summer because I felt like I was fine, knew how to cope, and knew the anxiety I used to feel was just me overreacting at things. I was so rational, motivated, and normal on Paxil. I knew what I wanted to do in my future, had hobbies, good grades, worked two jobs, interned, and volunteered. 

Well fast forward to me tapering of in spring 2020, I was officially done with the med august 2020… then covid got worse and my boyfriend got sick. Queue my anxiety getting heightened. I was scared for my diabetic dad. Then February came and I switched my major just as I got accepted into a university after spending 4 years at community college. I was so lost with my future.  
In June I knew I needed help and was feeling suicidal from the anxiety. I couldn’t handle it. I called the crisis line like 5 times in a month. I convinced myself I had cancer and was going into a spiral everyday. I finally started seeing a therapist late June. She’s great, but I still feel impending doom. 
Whenever I drive, I convince myself I’m going to die. Whenever I have a stomach ache, I convince myself I’m going to have diarrhea in public (anxiety gave me very bad IBS) and because of this I pop pepto bismol and Imodium like candy ruining my natural digestive process. I also have a chronic bladder problem where I have to pee like 20 times a day and constantly feel like I have a UTI and I’m going to pee myself in public. It’s ruined traveling, Disneyland, and driving long distances for me. But I feel like anxiety made this problem worse, as my bladder was fine when I was on Paxil.I have a fear of eating and have convinced myself food is going to make me sick. So I regularly just live off of toast or pasta with vegan butter and salt. 
Anxiety is creating a lot of fears for me I need to stop in it’s tracks (like driving, going to concerts, theme parks, traveling) I am genuinely considering selling my Hamilton tickets I was so excited for because of my anxiety about my IBS and bladder. 
~end of anxiety life story~

I’m just so scared to go back on Paxil. I was still me on the drug. I just was more calm and collected. The only bad thing was getting off of it. That was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. 
I’m also scared how it will affect my relationship with my boyfriend and I. I read something that said SSRIs make people fall out of love?? What??? Granted, I don’t think this will happen as my boyfriend and I met when I was on Paxil. I continued to be on it for a year, I tapered off of it with his support. Plus I love him more than anything lol. I feel so guilty sometimes the way I treat him because of my anxiety. I get so irritable because I’m anxious and I constantly need his support. I question that he loves me and will never leave me. It must be so exhausting for him. 

I just feel defeated. I was only able to last a year off of the drug and here I am crawling back begging to be medicated. But I can almost see the future of my ibs, bladder illness, agoraphobia, health anxiety, and fear of driving (I can’t be scared of driving, I live in Southern California!!) consuming me if I don’t put a stop to this soon enough. I’m only 23 I have so much left in life

Wondering if anyone has experience with this, sorry for the long write up, I don’t see my therapist until Monday and needed to vent now :D",1
"Hello!
I had been experiencing an increase in general anxiety and mood changes because of my Nuvaring. My doctor upped my Paxil from 10 mg to 15 mg on Thursday. Since then I have been feeling weird. I feel like my skin is tingling and I don’t feel like myself. Like I’m floating away. I pinched myself and I could barely feel the pain. I can’t see my doctor for another 2 days. Has anyone experienced side effects like this? Advice?",1
"I took it for 5 days and it caused a lot of depersonalization so I stopped it it felt like I was going to forget my surroundings and my family members besides that it was okay at treating my anxiety. I’m currently on Zoloft and Zoloft sucks because it leaves me restless 2/47 idk if it’s akathisia. When I lower my Zoloft dose the restlessness stops but then I start having panic attacks. I was also on Fluvoxamine/Luvox and that one worked more on my ocd than my anxiety.

Right now it’s trying Paxil one more time or trying Lexapro",1
"I have been taking anti-depressants to deal with anxiety for about 17 years now, starting just after my freshman year of college. I have taken Lexapro, Zoloft, Effexor, and Paxil (paroxetine). I have taken paroxetine for about ten years now, and have felt very much happy and at peace taking a high daily dose of 60 mg per day.

However, I have had sexual side effects from the paroxetine.  My libido has been low.  This has never bothered me previously, but now my wife and I are trying to have a baby, and I have only been able to ""perform"" about once per week.  I talked to my regular doctor about the issue (I haven't needed to see a psychiatrist for about 8 years), and she told me start tapering off the paroxetine and start taking Buspar (buspirone) 7.5 mg twice per day. She also ordered testing for my testosterone levels, which showed that my total testosterone was low (although my free testosterone was in range), and I am scheduled to see a urologist in January.

Yesterday, I had a full-blown panic attack, and again now, today. I have been tapering the paroxetine for about 3 weeks now; I am still taking a quarter (15 mg) of the 60 mg dose I was taking, and have been taking the buspirone.

I feel like I have made a huge mistake.  I have asked my doctor what I should do going forward, but she won't respond for a few days, most likely.  I am tempted to just go right back up to my full dose of paroxetine and hope it starts working again.  I can live with a low sex drive, but panic attacks a debilitating. Have any of you had similar experiences?",1
"I have been on and off Paxil for 10 years. While it combats my anxiety well and doesn’t lead to panic attacks, I’ve had some side effects I can no longer deal with. I gained over 70 lbs even with consistent dietician tracking foods and strength training multiple times weekly. Also I have 0 libido. None. For me, I have been trying to find something that works better. Some haven’t worked, but in the process, I consistently get Paxil withdrawal symptoms. They are not pretty. Paxil is great for some, and helped me so much, but watch out for side effects",1
"I’m a little late to seeing this, but I just started Paxil 10mg and I feel my anxiety and panic attacks are worse. I know I read they may get worse before they’re better . Idk how long that’s going to take because I’ll wake up and feel a rush and go straight into a panic attack but since I take buspar 60mg it keeps me from losing my shit. It’s hard though because you start to assume the worst. I’ve been to the hospitals had test ran all of them and it came back good, it’s just having to control a panic attack without calling 911 is hell because I feel better knowing there’s people who can be there immediately, I just want to know does your anxiety get worse while taking it because idk if I wanna go through that again just to feel better. Every time I have a panic attack hr goes up to 140+ and I have to remain calm for it to come back down which takes a bit",1
No,1
I got paxil for depression after my dad died and I had a lot of other depressions also because depression it really runs in my family so after 2 weeks I mean two weeks to the day it says on the bottle I mean on the information package it says it will take up to two weeks to work and I swear to you that on the two weeks to the day I woke up and said hello family and my daughter she said my mama's back Yes and it worked and from then on it kept working and I feel like a new person I mean I just feel like I could see you again like a fog had been lifted off of me and everywhere I'd go I would have a smile on my face you know if I wanted to but I mean it just took that bad feeling away like bad feeling like nothing was right you know how depression is it feels like nothing's right the whole world is wrong but all that went away with paxil so it was really good experience I don't need it anymore and I'll sell my brother had to had had a bad depression thing like I said it runs in my family and he tried to paxil and other than that another man told me this too it takes away a couple of things for men that you know that they would can't make happen anymore but my brother said he didn't even mind that he said he felt so much better and when he said if he goes and gets him a girlfriend he'll quit taking it for a while and laugh out loud anyway he said he felt so much better just like I did like you can just see again it's just hard to explain it's just depression was gone that's what it was Yes try packs a little is really good paxil,1
"I started taking paroxetine 10 mg 3 days ago 
I suffer of depression,anxiety and panic attacks my whole life
I was on citalopram for 20 years,my life was not the best but I survived fine until last year when I started to feel more depressed 
I am 47 and going towards menopause 
I went to different doctors and they made me try other meds but it did not helped 
I tried escitalopram for 3 months, then I went back to citalopram with addiction of xanax to manage the anxiety 
Lately I tried mirtazapine but it makes me very sleepy and cymbalta I had to stop it after 5 days only because it was way to activating for me
I hope paroxetine  will help me ,I saw a lot of positive reactions here and gives me hope",1
"I just got prescribe it too and am wondering about anyone having interactions with caffeine? I get horrible headaches and caffeine is the only thing that helps. Just like one, max two, cups a day. I usually don’t even finish the one cup. I’m seeing mixed answers so thought I’d ask. It’s making me anxious to take my anxiety meds lol",1
W,1
I hope it helps you!! I have agoraphobia and now I feel calm outside. Give it time and try going out little by little,1
/r/trt,1
My brother took paxil because it depression runs in our family and we had just lost our dad so we both took it and it worked wonders for the depression but he did say that the man thing you're talking about did go away I mean he said he couldn't he didn't have any thoughts of that anymore he wasn't you know into it he said but if he got a girlfriend that he really liked that he'd put the paxil for a couple of weeks or something like that laugh out loud but anyway it does affect men in that way but the benefits are tremendous but if you got a regular girlfriend or wife or something you just have to explain to him that you have to take that medicine cuz you have to take it for like six months to a year to get your life back to normal till you learn how to be normal again that's what it's all about you have been so depressed for so long I guess anyway I was so depressed for so long I had to relearn how to live anyway to get to the bottom point paxil is a wonder drug for depression but it does affect men okay thanks  said hope that helps,1
bruh,1
For the most part I’d say yes,1
H,1
Nope. Just ect,1
"No I don’t recall having any breathing issues. Mostly brain zaps. A bit agonising, I recall. But that’s to be expected on Pexeva. My anxiety would typically cause my breathing problems back then. But, try getting a pulse oximetry monitor from your local chemist/pharmacist. If you’re above 95-96% blood oxygen % then you know it’s only the anxiety giving you fits. Not the Pexeva. Let me know how it’s going for you mate. Remember, you are not alone in this. It’s not the fault of yourself but your genetic design. I hope you get well",1
I’m switching from 150 mg of Zoloft to Paxil! Zoloft isn’t working for me anymore… are you still taking the Paxil??? Just worried about if there will be any side effects 🥴 been on Zoloft for 3+ years,1
Did the paxil atleast help your anxiety? Lol,1
"Not well actually. I come from a family of drinkers and one night had a really bad reaction with paxil and alcohol. Def don’t mix the two.. i’m doing terrific now, but not from any pills. I stopped taking paxil the day after I had the bad reaction",1
Are you in the US? Wondering if they are both available here,1
Paxil sucks btw,1
"can someone please help me i am on 12.5 day 10, and my anxiety feels bad today. just asking ressurance that it will pass. I have increased from 7.5",1
Was it your first SSRI? Did it make your anxiety worse in the beginning,1
"No, I took lexapro a few years ago and quit, and yes, it made my anxiety so much worse and then one day U woke up and it was gone",1
Ohhh no how long did the bad anxiety last if you remember ? Idk if I can get through that cause my anxiety already has me wanting to die lol,1
"Hey everyone! I am having a very hard time right now and I believe sharing this will be cathartic. Please be patient with any writing errors. Anxiety makes it hard to think. 

Nutshell version of things. Anxiety and depression run in my family. I know that I am genetically predisposed. I also didn’t realize until recently (I’m in my late 40s), that my environment growing up probably contributes to my issues. I never had a tragic event, nor was I abused. However, a parental figure was inadvertently teaching me to find fear in everyday life. It was always worst case scenario. For example, I was told that as a child, the lenses of toy sunglasses were removed for fear they would shatter and cause blindness. And the weather. The weather was a big one. If there was mention of any kind of storm, going out was “nuts.” Or when it snowed, the roads were always “treacherous,” and to venture out would be “death defying.” Looking back, I had massive separation anxiety as a child, and in my early 20s, I started having horrific panic attacks. 

Fast forward 25 years or so, and I am weaning off of paroxetine. I was on citalopram for a number of years, but went off for awhile. I went on 20 mg of paroxetine in 2007. That got bumped to 40 mg in 2014. I dropped to 30 mg around Thanksgiving of last year, 20 mg in January of this year, and then 10 mg this month. So, I’ve been on 10 mg for about 2 weeks. I thought the taper was going well, until the past few days. I’ve been depressed. The anxiety is intense. That warm, tight feeling in my chest. Feeling like I can’t catch my breath. Throat clearing. The feeling of water running through my legs. Pounding heart. Palpitations. Feeling like I have the flu. Irritability. Headaches. Fatigue. Stomach problems. Could these symptoms be from something else? Sure. But I go to the doctor regularly and I’m generally in good health. 

What’s going on in my life right now is undoubtedly playing a role. A close relative is in hospice and I was recently laid off. So why go off now? Why go off at all? For one, I started my taper before these life events occurred. I know I could go back to 20 mg for awhile, but I’ve done so much work dealing with these issues, that I just don’t want to run back as soon as the going gets tough. Further, the paroxetine stopped being effective long ago. And since I’ve cut down to 10 mg, sexual function has been restored. I’m feeling emotions more deeply. I don’t crave sweets like I did. I don’t want to experience life behind the veil of paroxetine. And if I simply can’t function without it, fine. But I refuse to believe that I can’t find peace without it. Regardless, I wanted to share my struggles and while I have no idea if “sending thoughts,” helps those who are suffering, I’m doing it anyway. Love to all!",1
"I'm not sure if anyone on here is active anymore but I stopped paxil 8 days ago. 
I've been on it a decade 40mg at the higher end. I was always silly with the meds, would choose not to take them for days at a time, up my dosage and down it etc etc. 
A few months ago I went down to 10mg from 40mg, it had no effect on me. After a few months I went down to 5mg for maybe a month then to 2.5mg for a month then 0mg. 

I've tried to come off it several times before and always got to around day 6 and had to go back on due to severe dpdr and agoraphobia. However I am doing okay. The first five days I had severe physical symptoms, brain zaps, migraines and fever. The brain zaps are just about gone now, no more headaches. The only lingering feelings are anxiety and dissociation. I have a feeling because I once spent two years in such a dissociative state I couldn't function or leave the house I have some PTSD from this and constantly check in on myself and I feel and if I'm going ""insane"" again, but I am doing my very best to just accept the feelings and sit with them. 

I am also listening to Claire Weekes books about dealing with nervous illness and it has been very helpful. 

I did join the site survivingantidepressants but found it to be very bleak, most people on there say they have taken years to taper and years to get back to even slightly normal and that's not anything I can handle hearing. I didn't manage to find any success story that didn't say it took them years. I found I was just being reprimanded for tapering too fast aka not tapering over years but if I'm being honest I know I wouldn't have been able to do that. 

Positives : I feel like my 20 year old self again in a few ways. Paxil eventually made me have 0 motivation for life, I didn't really care for music anymore, didn't care about my future, did what I needed to to survive but was mostly just existing. I feel hopeful now, I want to do things, I love music again and I'm crying a lot which yes is weird but it's nice to feel something. 

Negatives: some residual brain zaps, racing thoughts and feelings, dissociation, anxiety. Suprisingly no real depression. 

I guess I'm looking for people with similar stories. Before reading too much I assumed the first month or so would suck but things would get progressively better, now I've heard people can be fine then completely break down months later etc, this scares me and I know I shouldn't read into it but if someone could tell me that yes their withdrawal fucking sucked for a while they got there in the end. 

I'm not delusional and I know I'll have ups and downs, everyone does, but I'm just hoping I never go back to the horribly dark places I've been in before. 

Also, I take valdoxan at night, it was prescribed by my doctor when I spoke about wanting to withdraw and he said it may help soften the symptoms. Yes I'd love to be drug free but I knew Id tried it many times before without success and when I read about valdoxan being quite gentle and working in a completely different way with no side effects I thought I'd try - it has improved my energy levels and sleep a lot and do think it's responsible for me being able to handle this withdrawal. 

Thanks guys 😊",1
"Omg I was only taking 7.5 mg (for my hot flashes!) and took for about 6 months. I am having these brain zaps and tingles in my hands and feet when they happen. The doctors just say oh that shouldn’t have happened to you with such a low dose🤷‍♀️
Anyway been off them completely now about 1.5 weeks after weaning for about 2 weeks. Cannot wait for this to stop!!",1
I was on Paxil CR 12.5Mg for almost a year for hot flashes. I started to have stomach problems last year and upon reading that this meds can cause gastritis as I had a scope done and put the two together that Paxil CR was the cause of it. So I weaned off this meds and still have up and down on meds as my stomach hurt here and there . Somedays more tolerable than other other days.  I want to know will this get better as time goes on? I last took the Paxil CR 2 weeks ago and am not on it anymore.  I read that it can cause gastritis and other Problems.  Tell me this will get better eventually ? I hope because this med is pure evil and hell I don’t ever want to be on it ever again!,1
"I am going through hell right now and need some reassurance. My family and friends just keep saying ""hopefully it gets better"" 

I was on paroxetine for 5 maybe 6 years.  I was on 5 different ones before this one. I still would get depressed and have anxiety. Anyways..

Long story short, I got diagnosed with ADHD and got on vyvanse. So with vyvanse and paroxetine, still get depressed and have anxiety. So my np and I decided to go off paroxetine and try welbutrin.

I think I tappered off too fast and my nurse practitioner doesn't know a lot about this stuff so I can't really blame her for not warning me about what I would be going through

Its been less than a month and I went from 30mgs to being off it.

Its started with nausea and dizziness, then the heart palpitations and anxiety started. Then it turns into me not being able to get off the couch for 5 days. Day 7, went to the hospital due to feeling like having a heart attack or stroke. Turns out all is good but my resting heart rate is between 80 to 105 all the time. I am scared but nothing seems to be wrong.

Day 9 I spent the whole day puking and now im on day 10 and I'm still in the same boat. Dizzy, heart palpitations, anxiety, nightmares, insomnia, nausea, agitated, the list goes on

I need to know there is a silver lining and it's going to get better",1
I had a good afternoon but I have been getting hot sweats. I see the dr on the 19. I don’t wait to be on meds. I do have energy and I try my best to work out atleast 4 times a week for only 10 min,1
I had to go up to 15 from 2.5 mg. It’s working tor me. I’ll be on it for like 2 months then taper to 10 another 2 months,1
"Hi, 
I'm withdrawing off Paxil currently and have been experiencing acid reflux, I believe. It presents as a weird/metallic taste in my mouth. To be fair I've dealt with acid reflux for many years and take prilosec daily. However, nothing changed in my diet, so I'm wondering if the metallic taste was related to the paxil withdrawal. 

The psych PA I'm working with says acid reflux/the metallic taste is NOT a known withdrawal symptom. It's a relief to hear someone else who dealt with this while weaning off paxil.

Edit: grammar",1
Day 9 off Paxil. I am legit questions every life decision I ever made. Just a little back story. I was put on for Anexity and panic attacks. Turns out I have pots so it was tachycardia not panic attacks. The brain zaps. Omfg the brain zaps. I can't do anything without puking. And I have vowed to never take another prescription med in my life. Also I don't know if my smell is heightened from being nauseous or I just smell extremely bad this week bit fuck every thing. Thay is all,1

What helped you with dizziness and feeling light headed,1
Did you guys have breathing problems getting of paxil,1
"So, I was put on Paxil back in 2009 in my late teens at 50mg, 😱 yes I said five zero, after several friends died of different deaths very tragically in about 6 week span and I was depressed.  (Normal human response)  I was depressed for few months & my mom suggested I talk to my doctor and maybe needed something to help get me out of the trench and said everyone sometime in their life will need help getting through grief and depressing moments in their lives. Well, with the generic Paxil only being on the shelf a few years at this time, not a lot of studies were done on its side effects or anything. My mom noticed me acting strange after several months of being on it, and suggested to get off that sh*t because you’re not yourself. Me being young, dumb, and naive didn’t know you had to be weaned off SSRI’s, and ESPECIALLY Paxil (being the worst) stopped cold turkey. 🫡🫣🫠 Let me just explain to you why I explicitly beg people to never take Paxil to begin with. I suffered horrendous side effects from withdrawal. I LEGIT felt like a heroin addict going through withdrawal and I only know because of looking up the withdrawal symptoms. I laid in the bathroom for days because my insides were detoxing from Paxil. Extreme nausea, diarrhea, vomiting…. I couldn’t walk for a week because I was beyond dizzy, i literally crawled in my mom’s house to get small bits of food from the kitchen and go lay back down. I didn’t drive for that first week either because of this extreme dizziness, I had the brain zaps feel like being struck by lightning. I was terrified to fall asleep because I kept having multiple horrific nightmares back to back and I would wake up drenched in sweat. I stayed up for as long as I could and then fell asleep from exhaustion. It was THEE WORST EXPERIENCE any medicine has ever made me feel in my life. I suffered for a few weeks detoxing, but the first week was the worse. BEWARE!! ",1

"I’m dealing with coming off paxil after 30 years!
The withdrawal is awful.
I’m cross tapering with Prozac. I don’t know if that helps I guess it does but the withdrawal is still awful.
The very worse was going from 10 mg to 5
Just about destroyed me so back on 10 mg and waiting for it to stabilize
No way can I go from 10 to 5
I’m going to cut a 10 mg pill into 4 ths and taper more slowly
Did y’all have adrenaline surges. Horrific!
On top of that is anxiety, irritable and scared! Awful feelings

Was at 40 mg
Now 10

There’s no liquid and it isn’t compounded so stuck using the tablets but will def cut in pieces and try to wean slower.

See doc next week… not ready to start decreasing yet. Still anxiety bad in the mornings with trembling.

Does this get better?????
Can you really get off Paxil and be good again???  U cant help but feel down when u feel such dread",1

"hello! i'm not sure if you'll see this since it's been months but i'm 19yo and i just started paxil 20mg. i've had horrible ocd and panic attacks since i was around 12, and the constant anxiety has taken away so much joy from my life. because of this, i also got pretty bad depression. i was on zoloft for years, eventually going up to 150mg. i couldn't go up to the maximum dose because i had a pretty bad reaction when i tried. ive also been having horrible pmdd symptoms, like, before my menstural cycle i'd either be numb or i'd feel so angry and upset at the thought of BEING awake. everything is just piling up, and my doctor made me really hopeful about paxil. but now i'm reading all these stories, and now i'm scared. i'm scared and i'm even more anxious. do you have any advice? is it worth it? i really just want to feel better, i want to feel normal and i want to feel the same energy i used to have when i didn't get constant panic attacks. i wish zoloft still worked. if paxil works for me and i'm on it for years, would it be for nothing?",1
"how it's going, did you successfully discontinue paroxetine",1
The anxiety is almost unbearable,1
"I had to get off of Paxil for one reason - gastritis.  Something you don't ever want to deal with. It's a very painful condition.  Paxil causes increase stomach acid and Paxil causes a erosion to the stomach lining aka gastritis. Once it's damaged it takes at least a good 6 months to a full year for stomach to fully heal from it. You can't even eat or drink at times because it will hurt your stomach so bad. You have to avoid certain foods, you will lose weight as I have lost over 25 pounds because you can't/ don't feel like eating with gastritis.  I had to start taking famotidine in order to help with the daily pain / nausea I got from Paxil.  I was only on it for hot flashes not depression.",1
"Hey!!!! I'm with you on going down... at one point I was at 40 mg after suffering a TBI from a car accident 3 years ago and developing C-PTSD and crippling anxiety. I had been on 20 mg for 2 years  and went down to 10 mg for 2.5 mos. I am on day 5 of nothing and it is miserable. The night sweats, dreams, stomach yuck is awful, but I can deal... what I don't like is the brain zaps and feeling like my brain and body do a little quiver/shake. I'm fighting the urge to go back and try 5 mg to step from but I'm 5 days into this.... blahhhhhhh... anxiety is too bad but I haven't been leaving the house much",1
"I’m finding the anxiety to be so awful with decreasing Paxil.
Am cross tapering with Prozac but after 2 months on that I was still having hard to live with anxiety surges. So, doc said get off Prozac  it’s not doing what it needed to do
Now I’m on Elavil… generic name starts with an A

 Not only is reducing Paxil awful you still have to go thru getting use to another anti depressing and then it changed again

I’m not changing again no matter what! This is awful
You said you haven’t left your house much. I feel ya. The fear like feelings/ anx is extreme
Did you have this?

I can’t help but think this HAS to get better. Today was a wake up severe agitation…. Horrible

How r u coping and did u experience these things",1
"Hi
Glad you reached out. This is a tough journey!
I was,at first, put on Remeron while tapering off Paxil because the side effects of reducing Paxil is bad. Then the doctor retired.
So, the next doctor said let’s put you on Elavil and I’ve been on that. 
So yes, I am taking that while on Paxil. I also had the concern about being on both but I have found no problems doing it that way.
The Elavil calms the anxiety rushes  and helps with sleep. 
I am on 25 mg which is not a high dose.
It took 1 to 2 weeks to not feel groggy in the mornings from the Elavil. But then that all dissipated.

I have gotten down to 10 mg of Paxil then 5 and it was awful. That’s when they prescribed the Elavil and went back up to 10 so my system could slowly adjust.
( so Remeron first, then Elavil… they both do about the same thing)

As of today, I’m still having restlessness in the mornings and am wondering if I may need to increase the Elavil if I ever want to start trying to reduce the Paxil to 0…. Which is our goal.

Good luck.
Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
I got on this site because I wanted to see if others were having a hard time reducing Paxil.

Doc said it is the worst SSRI to get off of and prescribed less often now due to that.

If I’ve confused you feel free to ask me any questions 
I’ll be interested to see how you do getting off Paxil.
If u take Xanax it’s short lived so the Elavil was helpful for the huge anxiety I had from reducing",1
"Was on paxil 6 years. Got sick and tired of sides that never resolved (mostly sexual) so doc put me on zoloft. Well I hated the zoloft. Made me feel agitated as hell. So now I'm off the zoloft per her instructions for the last two weeks.

My God I'm miserable. I'm thinking it's not the zoloft now but the paxil withdrawals still. I'm extremely tired but unable to sleep usually because of brain zaps and uncontrollable feelings in my legs. They feel so agitated and restless no matter what I do. I'm praying it starts to get better soon. Op says I need to just power through it",1

"It's hard to say bec ""Paxil"", has a long half-life and is one of the hardest drugs to discontinue. More people are starting to go back on Paxil, due to the harsh withdrawal symptoms. Some Dr's are prescribing alternate antidepressants that are easier to taper off while on Paxil., so when Paxil clears their system they start tapering from the alternate antidepressant. I recently stopped alprazolam 1 mg tid, in a week I was suffering from major withdrawal symptoms that I used THC/CBD tabs to flush out alprazolam without any side effects or seizures then discontinued the tabs., as opposed to suffering from  ""Akathisia"" from benzos. So, you have options, to either withdraw from Paxil (which could take months to ?) or talk to your doctor and try the alternate route or do what I did. I know what you're going through and I'm sorry you're going through it",1
"Noo, hey, don't cry, I'll help you figure this out but first you need to start tapering the valium's because that's causing you to have the suicidal thoughts. Also you need to talk to your doctor and start some kind of antidepressant, alright? If you tell your Dr you have S. thoughts, he'll immediately stop prescribing valiums",1
Pharmacotherapy has poor evidence but if I went that route I’d sooner use Mirtazepine than Paroxetine,1

Doesn’t seem great",1
Confounding by indication,1
"They seem like they were extremely sick, I would not beat yourself up. I do not think 30mg paroxetine would contribute greatly to serotonin syndrome, withdrawing the Paxil quickly would also certainly cause somatic symptoms, If the patient were conscious which it does not seem like they were fully so",1
"Like the title says, I'm now completely off of Paxil after 25 years of use.

I started on Paxil (20mg) at age 10 for OCD and GAD. It seemed to help but it never sat well with me that I'd have to be on an SSRI for the rest of my life. I tried to taper off once in high school and again in college. Both times, I tapered completely off within a month and was walloped with withdrawal symptoms. However, I always believed that what I was feeling was simply the unmedicated version of myself. Both times, I reinstated Paxil which made me feel better and reinforced my belief that I'd need to be on Paxil for the rest of my life.

Once I turned 30 (still on 20mg of Paxil), I started to spiral due to work/life stress. Because I was so stressed, I went to my doctor and we decided it was time to up the dose of my paxil since I had been on 20mg for so long. We doubled my dose to 40mg.

What followed was months of suicidal ideation and some mania (both of which I had never experienced before). I figured these issues were due to the mental breakdown I seemed to be having and not the increase in dosage of Paxil. My doctor agreed.

Things eventually calmed down but when Covid/quarantine hit, I started to spiral again. This time I was determined to seek treatment outside of therapy/meds which I had been doing for many years. I started taking online meditation classes which were incredibly emotionally difficult, interesting, and ultimately very healing and helpful. After about a year of these classes, I suddenly felt the need to come off of Paxil once and for all.

Btw, I am not anti-psych drug or anti-SSRIs, but I felt ""called"" to get off. It just didn't feel right in my gut to be on Paxil. I felt emotionally numb, distant from my wife, and often had very dark thoughts. After I read ""Your Drug May Be Your Problem"" I thought that a slow taper would be worth it. I wanted to get completely off of Paxil, get thru the withdrawals, and see who I was on the other side.

I started learning everything I could about tapering. Even though I read about the 10% reduction every 2-3 weeks guideline, I was too eager to get off of Paxil and reduced my dose by 25% the first month, then a 33% drop the next month. That's when the withdrawals hit. They were really intense so I slowed my taper considerably. I made a promise to myself to never ""up- dose"" or return to a previous higher dose. I simply wanted to slowly reduce my dose, no matter how long it took

Whenever my withdrawals would get too intense, I'd hold at whatever dose I was at (sometimes for months) before returning to tapering.

I'm now completely off of Paxil. My last year of tapering was very slow (and therefore, much easier.) I spent a year tapering from 4mg to 0mg.

I wanted to post here because when I was tapering, I often doubted if I'd ever succeed in getting off of Paxil. And would I ever feel normal again? I'm happy to report that I feel very good, calm, and have a better understanding of my emotions than ever before. The tapering process was extremely difficult but caused me to grow as a person in a positive way. 

The withdrawal symptoms have all disappeared and I also no longer identify as OCD/GAD. I still have times where I experience anxiety or depression but during those times, I try to understand what I'm needing and address those needs. I now exercise, practice deep breathing, and most importantly, acknowledge that my thoughts and feelings are not anything to be afraid of. I feel much more thankful for my life these days and I feel as though my heart has opened up.

Getting off of SSRIs seems to being up two major challenges: 1.) dealing with the temporary (but unpleasant) physical/mental/emotional withdrawal symptoms and 2.) addressing the underlying issues that caused the need for the SSRI in the first place",1
"Hello. I got prescribed paxil today because after I came to the doctors for mental health concerns. I told my doctor I would prefer not to take prescriptions but she still recommended it to me. I have been doing research and I’m really scared to take this. I don’t want it to permanently change my brain, and I don’t want to depend on it. I am prescribed 20 mgs, and I have to break them in half for the first week. I really want to tell my doctor through my website that I don’t want to try it and to try to go the route to talk to someone. Should I do that, or should I at least try it? If I try it, I still wouldn’t want to take everything I’ve been given. ",1

"Went to a psychiatrist for the first time today, I scheduled the appt like two months ago. They prescribed me Paxil 20mg for my mild MDD and OCD. 

I’m worried about this for several reasons—I have been feeling like overall my mental health is improving. I initially scheduled this appt due to OCD surrounding psychosis after having a psychotic episode. My symptoms/paranoia have improved a ton since I scheduled this appt. I still have relationship OCD, but I feel like this is also improving over time with therapy and increased self esteem. I’m worried meds will induce another episode or cause weight gain (my main two worries).

I feel like my diagnosis doesn’t affect my life to the point where I can’t work or do school. The only thing it might be affecting is my relationship (my obsession over it), motivation to do chores or work (still do them eventually) and the ability to make friends (I have no urge to make friends I think due to my CPTSD, hanging out with friends gives me anxiety).

Should I try this medication given its harsh withdrawal symptoms if I stop? I just feel like maybe my symptoms aren’t bad enough to warrant. I also have PMDD which keeps me fatigued, irritable, anxious, and isolated but that passes once I start my period (I understand this med could help).

Looking for ppl who may have had similar worries and what happened",1

"Tomorrow I'll be starting 20 mg of Paxil for my out of control anxiety, panic, and intrusive/ruminating thoughts. I've been on Lexapro 10 mg for 2 years and I always felt like it just ""kind of"" worked. Never fully got me where I want to be, and in the past 2 weeks I've been hit with an explosion of anxiety and panic symptoms. I tried upping the dose to 20 mg, did it for exactly 1 month and this current anxiety episode I'm in actually started while on the increased dose. I don't think it necessarily caused the symptoms I'm feeling, but it certainly hasn't done anything to ward off this horrible wave. 

My mom had tremendous success with Paxil and took it for nearly 20 years, so I'm giving it a shot as well. I'm currently in a tense stage of my life so I'm sure that's played a part, but I'm looking forward to starting tomorrow and I'm happy to keep you all updated on my progress if interested! Feel free to message me.

UPDATE (DAY 23): So far I feel… less bad but still wouldn’t say I’m “good”. I feel more tired throughout the day and I feel like my anxiety levels have lessened slightly but not to the point I want to be at. Week 2 I felt improvement, week 3 felt some ups and downs and now in the beginning of week 4 I’ve felt bad anxiety again. I see my psychiatrist this week and will likely increase my dose to 30mg.

UPDATE (DAY 28): The past few days I’ve felt significantly better! It felt like on day 24 things just started to roll off my mind easier. Intrusive thoughts didn’t hurt as much nor did they stick around as long. Its easier to stay present. Today I increased my dose to 30mg so I’m expecting a slight setback but now I feel confident that Paxil DOES work for me, so looking forward to better days :) if you’re considering taking Paxil or an SSRI but are afraid to, don’t be afraid. The side effects have been pretty much irrelevant and the progress made is so worth it.

UPDATE (DAY 37): I’ve been on 30 mg for 10 days now and I can happily say I feel essentially back to my normal self. Intrusive thoughts only happen a handful of times a day and they are easy to shake instead of getting stuck on it. The associate anxiety with them is also gone. I feel some fatigue throughout the day and my sex drive is lower but it’s not totally gone. Still there enough but I think it might have been a little too high to begin with. Anybody going through a rough patch or considering taking Paxil I highly recommend giving it a chance. 37 days ago I felt hopeless and afraid that the darkness would never end. Now I have my life back. Hopefully this post helps somebody else in need. Stay strong friends.",1

I tried many antidepressants through the years and the side effects were awful. I finally discovered Paxil and it has, really helped my anxiety and depression immensely. I am a better mother, wife, and person overall. The only drawback is that I have zero desire to be intimate and find it impossible to climax. It has taken a toll on our marriage and even made me feel like less of a woman. I really want to get off the medication but the thought of being off medication really freaks me out.

"Hey all, been on 10MG Paxil daily for 5-6 years now (33/M) and it has been absolutely wonderful. I had my first random panic attack back in 2018 when I was between jobs, had me in the hospital because I felt like I was losing my mind. Doctor put me on 10mg Paxil, that took...maybe a month or two to fully kick in? Been fine ever since...up until a month ago. I decided to start weening myself off Paxil because I felt like I was back to normal around November '23, when my dad was put in the hospital. Took half a pill (10mg) every other day until my dad passed last month, between the stress of starting a new job, buying a house, losing a parent and realizing I only have my almost 80 year old mother left, I broke.

I started going back on my daily Paxil dose, but felt like I needed some help until it kicked back in, as I felt I was losing my mind again. Doctor prescribed me 10mg Buspar ""as needed"" which worried me a bit because everything I found on Buspar said it needed consistent dosage to be effective. Two days into my Paxil and Buspar 2x a day, I'm seeing results, day by day until about 10 days in, I feel like myself again. I decided to come off the Buspar and go as needed, but two days later, last Saturday, I felt the anxiety creeping back in. I've been taking my Buspar again every 12 hours for 3 days so far, but I'm not seeing much improvement, especially nowhere near like I did before. I do notice though, I tend to feel about 90% normal at night, about the time I get off work and head home. I take Buspar in the morning around 11AM when I get up, and Buspar and Paxil together when I get home around 11PM. 

  
I keep telling myself the medication needs time to ramp back up  to level me out again, but man.. I hate how easily it is to feel like I'm not in control. I'd really like to come off the Buspar at some point and just go back to my Paxil and be fine, but it feels like I might be stuck taking more pills for a while. Anyone else on this combination? It would be nice to get some insight about roughly how long it took for anyone else to feel normal again. I want to feel like myself again, even if it means taking some extra pills to help. ",1

"hi all. i’ve been on paxil for about 3-4ish months. recently, i’ve been getting very nauseous, dizzy, and fatigued. i’m not sure if it’s the meds or something else. it just started happening recently. i feel like i’m hungry or i have hunger pains even if ive ate. sometimes after i eat i feel crappy. i’m not sure if this is my meds or something else. sometimes i actually feel like my eyes won’t focus but they are. it’s little odd things that started. does anyone else or has anyone else dealt with this? MONTHS AFTER starting paxil?",1
"20 year old male 

i have started having bad panic throughout the day and especially when i wake up heart racing

my doctor prescribed me Buspirone 5 MG (twice a day) and Paxil 10 MG (once a day)

this is my 2nd day on them, the buspirone is fine no side effects, but she recommended taking the Paxil before bed to see if it makes me tired, and if it keeps me up to take it in the morning.

anyways I took the paxil last night before bed and i woke up 4 times through the night vomiting anything i could

now i am scared to take it again, is it possible i ate some bad food or has this happened to one of you?

and i can deal with nausea and stuff but i legit woke up out of sleep and threw up bad bad multiple times",1
"Anyone that had gotten off Paxil - 
What helped you most during Paxil withdrawals? Please don’t say nothing since I’m already terrified enough and barely have the guts to do it",1
I have been taking Paxil for 3 weeks. After months of my drs wanting me to try SSRI again and again. I choose Paxil because long ago when I took it my anxiety was lowered. I believed that I could take it no matter what side effects it has. This week I am starting to feel extremely numb. I feel very spaced out and tired. This numbness is makes me very miserable on continuing Paxil!!!,1
"I have been on paxil 12.5mg cr for 18 days, and most of that time had a loss of appetite and nausea, with some anxiety. When does this go away? I am struggling to push forward with this because years ago it really helped me for a depressive period. ",1
"Hey (this is my first post on Reddit).
I suffer from anxiety, depression, severe sleep disorder and have had panic disorder in the past (but no longer). I tried sertraline (Zoloft) 50-100mg for 2 years and it actually helped a lot with the panic disorder and improved my mood a lot. I stopped because I thought I didn't need it anymore (big mistake) and because I suffered from brain zaps (= electric shocks in the brain that don't hurt. You are ""mentally absent"" for a millisecond).
After a 3-month break from Sertraline (where I was mentally worse), my psychiatrist prescribed me Fluoxetine. He said that due to the longer half-life, there should be no brain zaps during treatment (in his opinion, brain zaps are a discontinuation symptom). So now I've been taking Fluoxetine for 4 weeks, but I've already had a few brain zaps in the meantime. Also, after 4 weeks I feel that the fluoxetine is not improving my mood or reducing my anxiety.

Today I saw a new psychiatrist who doesn't think the brain zaps will go away with a longer half-life antidepressant. She said that you can treat such ""absences"" (= the word she used for the brain zaps) with specific medication (She hasn't told me which one yet. She wants to do an EEG examination first and then we will clarify this further). However, she said that Paroxetine would be better suited to my diagnosis
.
I would like to know what your experience is with Paroxetine (Paxil). Do you have experience with the transition from antidepressants?

I am a little worried because Paroxetine has such a bad reputation. I also don't quite understand why I wasn't prescribed Escitaloprame (Lexapro).

Do you have any experience with Escitaloprame (Lexapro) and Paroxetine (Paxil) in comparison?

I would be grateful for any experience reports!

UPDATE: I was diagnosed with epilepsy! The antidepressants have lowered the seizure threshold. Now I‘m getting meds against epilepsy. ",1
"hello. about 5 months ago i cold turkeyed off of celexa like an idiot. the first couple of months went fine, actually it was surprisingly easy. fast forward to april and i started having the worst depression and ocd anxiety i have ever had in my life. i mean on the brink of ending it bad. i tried to reinstate with lexapro, celexa again, and prozac. neither of these i could tolerate more than a week because of increased anxiety when starting. well, today i went to see my psych and he prescribed me paxil because he said it was very helpful for extreme ocd. after reading all of the negative side effects i am debating on whether to take this med again. i took my first dose today (5mgs) and i didnt really have too bad of side effects other than increased heartbeat and terrible dizziness and a slight headache. should i keep taking this med, i am just scared because it is apparently notorious for withdrawals on these forums. i really want to ride it out and take it for a month or so and see if it works. i honestly couldnt feel much worse than i have been lately. i mean it has been bad, but my psych said after 5 months off of celexa cold turkey (i was on it 12 years) that my brain had no serotonin left and that is why i feel like this. i mean my ocd has literally been off of the charts to the point its scaring me. i am just worried i will take this med for a month and be stuck on something that is making me feel worse and i cannot come off of because the withdrawal is too bad. has this ever happened to anyone. this 5 months has also left me extremely sensitive to meds. i also take buspar and have some benzos if needed for the increased anxiety that will come along with starting paxil. i just want to be better and not have constant ruminating horrible and i mean horrible thoughts so bad to the point i couldnt even get out of bed last week and it makes me sad when i see my dog. this is bad. i need advice. paxil is pretty much the last resort. i also take 2400mg of gabapentin daily too for my severe diabetic neuropathy. can anyone give me some encouragement and advice? would i be kindling my already weak CNS? I just have to have some relief and i cant take benzos everyday because they work too good and are more addictive than heroin. anyone have any advice for me? thanks.",1
"I’m discontinuing Paxil and stopped after a week of tapering. That might be my problem, such a short taper, but I haven’t been on them that long either. These brain zaps occur each time I move my eyes, clench my jaw, and turn my head. Sometimes the zaps get so bad to where I can feel it shoot down my arm or leg and completely disorient me, making me feel like I might fall over. Fun stuff, anyone else? ",1
"I am currently on Anafranil, but might have to try Luvox, Paxil or Prozac soon.

Anyone have experience",1
"My psychiatrist put me on Paxil after lexapro wasn’t working. I was on Paxil 20mg for 4 weeks before she made me switch to lithium (Paxil worked great the first two weeks, but then it plateaued.) 

She suggested I take the Paxil every other night while I start the lithium so I can “taper off.” Then it all went to hell. 

I started taking lithium on Wednesday (no Paxil), then on Thursday (with Paxil) and on Friday (no Paxil.) 

Saturday the vomiting started. I had nausea all week, but I threw up a lot on Saturday. I attributed it to lithium toxicity. But I was on lithium for 3 days only??

Then the gastritis was awful awful awful. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t sleep. 

The vivid dreams came all at once. Any nap I took or sleep I had was plagued with super HD dreaming. 

My psychiatrist suggested I stop everything altogether until the vomiting got better. Sunday night I took the Paxil again because I was wondering if it was withdrawals I was experiencing. I felt a bit better. Is that possible after being off Paxil for only like 2 days?? 

Today is Wednesday and I have been dizzy for the past two days, my left eye is hurting like a bitch, and the nausea came back. 
I also noticed I am starting to question reality. Which is terrifying me. Feelings of depression and hopelessness came back and have been crying for no reason. The worst is questioning reality. 

TL;DR. Can this be withdrawal after being off Paxil for ONLY TWO DAYS??? Or can it something else?? ",1
"
Okay so I have been on 800mf 3x a day of gabapentin for 6 months. About the last couple of months I have noticed an unbelievable spike in intrusive thoughts and horrible anxiety and a sense of impending doom about 4pm everyday. It usually lasts until 8 pm or 9 pm and eases off but not by much. Sometimes it can last until I take my last dose of gabapentin.

I dose at 7,3, and between 9 and 10 everyday. Lately I have had horrible trouble sleeping and waking up at 4 am and I can tell I am craving something. I normally micro sleep until 7 and take my gabapentin. Then I sleep for another few hours. Could this be inter dose withdrawal? I know I am on a high dose, but my doctor says there’s no such thing as Id withdrawal.

My question is, why does the anxiety let up at night after my last dose? The second dose of the day doesn’t even faze it usually. I take busepar the same time I take my gabapentin. I’ve found if I take the busepar an hour or so before I take my gp it isn’t that bad. This is the worse anxiety I’ve ever had. So bad I started Paxil a week ago. Although the Paxil has made me more nervous starting it like they said it would I still get that anxiety in the same interval everyday. My doctor won’t go up on my dose so idk what to do. It’s 5pm now and I haven’t took my second dose yet and my anxiety is off the charts. I am trying to wait it out to take it later if I can so maybe I can get some sleep tonight.

I know this isn’t in my head. Could it be the gabapentin causing this? And why does it ease off after my last dose I just don’t understand.

Can anyone give me some advice on what to do and how to start a taper to get off this horrible drug?

I have klonopin to take if I need to but I try my best not to cause it’s just another addiction I’ll have. Will the Paxil even help this? Advice?

I’ve never had anxiety like this. The busepar does not touch it. 

I also cold turkeyed 40 mg of celexa in January like an idiot. Hopefully the Paxil will do something I’m on day 6 of only 5mg and so far it’s just make it worse. I just need some relief. Should I be afraid to take the benzos until my Paxil quits giving me more anxiety?",1
Has anyone had any experience with being on Paxil and lexapro at the same time? I currently tapering off lexapro onto Paxil. I am taking 10mg of lexapro and 10mg of Paxil and I am feeling the best I’ve felt in a very long time. Has anyone’s psychiatrist kept them on both? I’m almost nervous to stop taking the lexapro because that really helped my anxiety but wasn’t working on my depression hence the start of the Paxil. Thanks! ,1
"Hello. I (19F) was diagnosed this morning with depression for which I was prescribed Paroxetine. I took the first pill (20mg) at around 9:30am. Since then, my whole body is lowkey shaking and I have involuntary spasms throughout my body, like I've had too much of an energy drink. The worst is when I yawn: my neck tenses and feels like I'm being strangled and my jaw feels paralyzed for a few seconds. Is there any way to calm this down? Is this normal or should I go back to my doctor?",1
"I want to start with, I am fucked up. This medicine has fucked me up so if I misspell something or sound stupid this is why. I am really struggling right now with memory loss, confusion, blurred and dizziness. It was really really bad when I was on Wellbutrin. Doctor took me off and put me on Paxil. My therapist recommended I do not take a break because the Paxil will help the withdrawal side effects from Wellbutrin. He said I am extremely sensitive to these medications and that he put me on the lowest dose of Paxil. 

I just feel really really emotional, because to be quite fucking FRANK, I can’t remember shit. I can’t get anything done because I’m like dory from finding Nemo and I’m trying really hard and getting nowhere. I’m exhausted to my bones. To be quite honest with you, I’m high as shit… but not in the good way. In the dory way. 
My therapist is getting me into a psychiatrist, who she says can help better diagnose me and put me on medication that will actually help me and not make me… like this. 


But please tell me I am not alone feeling like a damn dementia patient. I’m literally losing days of time.",1
"In 2021 I was initially put on Prozac and then Lexapro. I no longer remember the dosages, but I know they were too high for me. I dealt with many side effects, including increased anxiety and panic attacks when Wellbutrin was added to counteract the Lexapro side effects. One symptom I remember is extreme brain fog. I'd just sit at my desk or on the couch and not really be able to get my brain to do anything. 

I stopped all medication that same year and went back to struggling with depression and anxiety with no help. In late 2022, I was referred to a psychiatrist who I think is great. He listens to me and reassures me. The most important thing for me was starting at a very low dose, as I was pretty sure I was sensitive to antidepressants, since in 2021 I experienced so many side effects that the medical professionals assured me wasn't normal or shouldn't be happening. He started me at 5 mg of Paroxetine/Paxil and through 2023 I slowly moved up to 20mg. A few months ago my work situation became too much and my psychiatrist agreed it was time to move up to 30mg. It has been just over 2 months since that switch and I'm wondering if my extreme tiredness is due to that increase. I'm back to just kind of sitting and not being able to do anything. It doesn't feel like extreme brain fog yet as much as just mental tiredness. I get enough sleep, but it's like I can't function because I just don't have the will or motivation to get up. 

&#x200B;

I'm wondering if there's anything that can be done about this besides either stopping medication and spiraling again or just suffering through. I'm so tired and it's affecting my ability to get things done. My psychiatrist is great, but I'm not sure if there are many options besides just accepting the costs is worth the benefit of this medication.

&#x200B;

Some other information that might be relevant: I'm autistic; I've started getting random brain zaps (but not as bad as I experienced when withdrawing from Lexapro) though I still take Paxil; my anxiety isn't great to be honest, but I've learned to live with it by reducing activities and interactions that are difficult; I've had some recent big changes that include quitting my job (I'm kind of ashamed to tell my psychiatrist this, but I think the tiredness had something to do with me not being able to perform my job as expected) and adopting a puppy with my partner. I do need to improve my physical fitness (the new dog is helping with that) and lose weight, but this extreme tiredness/lack of motivation is quite recent.

Has anyone taken Viibryd to “bridge the gap” when trying to come off of Paxil? ,1
"Hey guys!

Long time lurker here, and I've actually just created my 1st Reddit account, so bear with me as I navigate through Reddit. I wasn't so sure if to post this here on either r/Anxiety or r/Paxil_Paroxetine, but here goes my story with Paxil, which I've been taking since October 2021.

I'm making this post, as I see a lot of bad comments regarding Paxil and people nervous about side-effects particularly on weaning off. I've started taking Paxil in late 2021- I reached rock bottom so bad, that I actually moved away from the country I was living in the past 8 years, left my job that I was for 2 years and a relationship of 5 years, all in the matter of 5-6 days. I was in such a panic/maniac state that my father had to drag me to the psychiatrist and like many of us here, I was not entertaining the idea of taking any sort of medication at all, because I thought I'd become a Zombie.. I was prescribed 30MG of Paroxetine, which I started in increment of 10MG over the course of 3 weeks.

At this time, the only side-effect I was experiencing was a heavy sleepiness, but to be fair, I was exhausted and kinda needed that to reset my whole brain and existence- I was literally sleeping for 12-15 hours each day. As time went on, the improvements were INSANE - I was a normal 28 year old again going out with my friends, working out and playing rugby. I've stayed on 30MG up until a few months ago, and the only thing I can tell you in regards to side effects was that I gained a fuck ton of weight (Around 15kg), I just get this insatiable hunger all the time, and that I was lasting WAY LONGER in bed (Which to be fair I kinda miss lol).

As of last month, I weaned off to 5MG (Quarter of a pill) and next week I'll be done with Paxil. Basically my wean off was always 10mg at a time, and the plan I had with my psychiatric was the following:

January 1st to 15th: 30MG on even days & 20MG on odd days  
January 16th to 31st: 20MG  
February 1st to February 14: 20MG on even days & 10MG on odd days  
February 15th to March 1st: 10MG  
March 1st until March 8th: 10MG on even days & 5MG on odd days  
Today: Started doing the same thing with 5mg

I have experienced literally 0 side effects during this process, and I attribute a lot of it to the advice I'm going to be giving you, which really helped me with this battle with anxiety/depression: We're not robots, we're not meant to feel 100% of the time- No one does. Stop trying to find a root and cause to what you're feeling, just ride it out. Maybe I felt some side effects, but I didn't dwell on it because it's normal to have some days that I'm a bit more anxious or more sleepy or whatever and days that you feel like superman and super productive. Stop trying to find the cause of what you're feeling, a lot of times it has no explanation as the human body is a wierd thing.. It may be the paxil or whatever, but who cares? Tomorrow I'll wake up feeling better! ",1

i've been switching between 10 and 20mg of paroxetine for approximately two years.

the doctor prescribed me 50mg (saw it later on my receipt, i dont know why we didn't discuss the dosage at my appointment 🤦🏽‍♀️) and i'm wondering, why are there such dosage differences? is zoloft somehow 'weaker' than paxil? 
why is the maximum dosage with zoloft (200mg) so much higher than paxil (60mg)?
i'm feeling pretty uncomfortable, taking such a high dose",1
"I'm on day 10 now. Feeling so exhausted, depressed, low mood, no motivation and fatigue. I've just been craving sweets since starting paxil. Idk what it is.

I got prescribed Paxil and I’m pretty skeptic on starting it,1
my psych said bc it causes birth defects so it’s not prescribed for women of childbearing age. I think it’s also an older med and they prefer prescribing newer ones that also tend to have less sides,1
It seems to hurt more people than it helps,1

"I was put on Paxil a month ago for anxiety and panic disorder as my Ecitalopram wasn’t working for me anymore.

With Paxil all I want to do is sleep and stay home, no motivation for life. I certainly need help with this matter, any advice will be appreciated.",1
Wish I knew that when I got it prescribed :( tapering it down was a hell,1
It still takes me 1-2 minutes to pee sometimes,1
Woah this is so WILD!!!! I’ve been having the hardest time peeing and I got on Paxil a week ago!,1
Prozac did this to me at 20mg. Got down to 10mg and it’s perfectly fine,1

No it's my time on any psychiatric medication,1
"It never caused me to gain weight.  And for panic disorder, it helped some - It was better than nothing for sure.  I added Wellbutrin XL a year and a half ago, so my depression has been helped greatly with that.  My doctor is actually switching me from Prozac to Cymbalta now to help with my anxiety.  I take Xanax daily so we’re trying to find something else that I can rely on for anxiety.  I’ve been on Prozac for 6+ years, so it’s also possible that it stopped working.  We shall see!  All in all, I think it’s certainly worth a try.",1
Yeah that’s why I’m considering it again too,1
Paxil has really bad withdrawal symptoms that’s about all the bad I could say about it,1
"Yes! When I went from Paxil to Prozac, the withdrawals weren’t so bad.  About a year prior I had started tapering down with the goal of getting off of Paxil completely.  I did it under doctors advice and whatnot but it threw me into a depressive state.  Depression runs in my family so it was likely just a matter of time.",1
Just realized I've repeated a couple things twice. Obv I didn't covid well. Two hospitalizations and no sleep,1
"I don't really have a question but I just want to say thanks for sharing, it gives me hope. Been on lexapro for almost 2 decades and I tried to come off and had the scariest, most awful, torturous withdrawal I've ever experienced. It was a year ago and I'm still scared to try again. Maybe one day",1
"I'll lay out my whole taper story for you below. I wanted to be detailed in hopes it helps you.

When I started my taper, I didn't quite know how much to drop, all I knew was to go ""slow."" 

So I simply dropped down based on the common dosages Paxil is available in. I went from 40mg to 30mg to 20mg. I dropped every 2 months during this time. Once I got to 20mg, my withdrawal symptoms were pretty intense. I read about tapering no greater than 10% of your dose at a time.  Dropping from 40mg to 30mg is a 25% drop. And 30mg to 20mg is a 33% drop. I was still eager to get off of Paxil so I decided to drop from 20mg to 17.5mg

I asked my psychiatrist for a prescription for 17.5mg and he said ""No. You should drop down to 10mg. That's the next smaller dosage that Paxil is available in."" I told him that'd be a 50% drop and that I didn't think that'd be a smart idea. He told me that was my ""anxiety returning."" I didn't feel anxious about this, I simply felt informed. So I told my psychiatrist thanks but I'll be seeking my prescriptions elsewhere moving forward. 

I then found a nutritionist who was used to working with people coming off of street drugs. His office had a doctor who could write prescriptions. I told them my plan to come off of Paxil and they saw no issue with me tapering slowly. The doctor agreed to write whatever dosages I would need in order to taper to 0mg.

So I then dropped to 17.5mg for a month or so, then 15mg. That's when I discovered liquid paroxetine. A game changer! Extremely helpful to get accurate and consistent measurements. I started dropping by 1mg every few weeks. Whenever my withdrawals got too intense, I would pause for a few extra weeks. A couple of times I took breaks that lasted months.

By the start of my third year of tapering, I was down to 4mg and my withdrawal symptoms were way less severe. I started to feel like myself again after two years of shit. I then spent a year dropping from 4mg to 0mg. I was in no rush and I could tell my nervous system was in a fragile state. I became paxil-free a couple of months ago and I would say I'm fully recovered at this point.

But I'm not the same. I've changed and for the better. I still have problems in my life and anxiety and depression visit sometimes but overall I FEEL so much more. And I'm filled with gratitude to have gotten thru that tapering process. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done.

One thing I would tell myself when I was really suffering was that I knew I would eventually come ""back online."" I would also tell myself I was a badass motherfucker and that I could survive this.

Also, I could tell that joy existed, I just couldn't access it. I felt hijacked emotionally and physically. But I would go for a walk and see people enjoying their lives. I chose to believe I would get back to that space. I just had to be patient and focus on sleep, good food, exercise, avoiding alcohol, cultivating loving relationships, staying busy with work, etc.

I also wanted to kill myself at different times. I just felt hopeless. I read a book called The Upward Spiral and it made me better understand suicidal ideation. I realized that I didn't actually want to kill myself but, perhaps a part of me did need to die. I needed to let go of believing I wasn't deserving of love. I needed to realize that I could destroy my life if I wanted to. I also became very curious about what life really does mean and what do I truly believe. If I had nothing to lose, maybe there's some freedom in that to explore. But I also don't think you can force any of this. If you do anything, try to focus on accepting yourself for exactly who you are and where you're at in life.

I did a lot of meditation and breath work practice during my withdrawal. I joined a support group over zoom too. I was struck by how much kindness I received. Meeting and talking with others helped me realize that 1.) Everyone has struggles but we have a say in how we respond to those inevitable struggles 2.) There is amazing power is listening to each other and lending support. That support extends both ways. Like right now, helping you is helping me. It's helpful for me to put these thoughts into words as well as remember my own taper journey.",1
thx cuz i read on google there might have interactions between them and it made my health anxety worst lol,1
"I totally understand. When your life feels like it's being run by OCD, PTSD, etc., it can be exhausting and feel very hopeless.

Two books come to mind that you might find interesting. ""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Bessel Van Der Kolk is kind of the go-to book on trauma and how amazingly skilled our minds are at creating coping mechanisms to deal with that trauma. PTSD might occur when someone experiences such trauma that their mind can't seem to fully process what happened. So the mind replays the event again and again and again. OCD can be a form of control after experiencing a loss of control at some point in one's life.

Looking at ""mental illness"" this way has really helped me understand what my body/mind is trying to do. These mental illnesses are almost like overactive bodyguards trying to help us cope thru traumatic events. However, these ""bodyguards"" seem to stick around long after the traumatic event is over, which is less than ideal.

The other book that comes to mind is more of a practical guidebook on how to ""move"" some of these feelings through the body. GuruMeher Khalsa wrote ""Senses of the Soul"" which includes a number of breathing/moving exercises that I found quite radical. Becca Williams was a meditation teacher I worked with for a while in group zoom settings and she teaches breathing techniques.

I did talk therapy for many many years and while it was helpful, it never seemed to get to the root cause of what was going on. I don't fully understand how these breathing techniques work but I do feel as though I was able to ""release"" something. I think psychedelic therapy may be similar in the sense that we need a way to ""look under the hood"" and treat the source of our pain (usually some sort of trauma or something we're hanging onto) in order to change a behavior. During these breathing exercises, our class would often smoke a small amount of cannabis which would allow me to really sink into these practices. It was amazing what would ""come up"" in my mind during these exercises. Old memories, different emotions, and sometimes what felt like ""messages"" from my inner self or some kind of higher power. It all sounds very woo woo to talk about, but I spent a year doing these exercises in a group setting anf ultimately, it was extremely helpful (and made me more spiritual, which I did not see coming!)

To answer your question, I've been completely off meds for a couple of months. But the last full year of my taper was spent from going from a measly 3mg to 0mg. I went really slow at the end, mainly because I was feeling so beat up from the two years prior. 

Also, I actually no longer consider myself as a person with OCD, anxiety, depression. When I believed that, it made me feel as though I was sick or broken. Now I consider myself  a person who has a broad range of emotions, experiences, coping mechanisms, etc. I realize this is kind of a semantics argument, but this slight change has helped create a little more space for self-love. I spent many years trying to change and fix myself before realizing that maybe all I need is a little love and acceptance. This love and acceptance slowly started to feel more powerful than my anxiety, depression, and OCD.

I do believe that doing this extra ""work"" on one's self is necessary for successfully coming off of meds. We have to work thru the withdrawals of the meds (which are temporary, albeit unpleasant) while also focusing on addressing the reasons that led us to take the meds in the first place. Luckily, this ""work"" can be done while on meds. I did a year of meditation (with no intention of getting off my meds) before I felt ""called"" to get off Paxil.

Long ramble! Maybe he does have OCD after all!! 😜 Thanks for reading.",1
"I’ve also found since being on Paxil I’ve become lazy, much more anti social and that wants me at all once upon a time, I want my motivation back. I’m currently on 7.98, from 20mg",1
Oh trust me I’m feeling like the time will come sooner than later. I had paxil 10 either poop out on me last Thanksgiving. It was that or I missed doses as I’m prone to do and then tried to go back up to 30 which was my high and I got way more anxious on the 30. It was similar to when I first started on Paxil. It can be freaking brutal.,1
thats reassuring. i don't drink so im safe on that side xD and currently im on 10mg of paxil for anxiety and panic attacks,1
When you say your humor creativity etc… what about joy? I’m off for about 3 months now and am still very emotional / get mad easily and don’t experience joy the way I used to before meds … how long did it take for those things to level ,1
I don't think they change your brain. They can have bad withdrawals if you need to stop and you might need to taper,1
Paxil made me gain 60lbs and engage in risky behaviors,1
"what are your symptoms, diagnosis? Can you function in daily life? i took paxil for 6 years, withdrawal is though",1
"I have depression and anxiety and I’m using Paxil for 7 weeks already. At first it was 10 mg, then 20 mg and now 30 mg (for 2 weeks).
I still have anxiety: can it be that paxil is not working. And I’m having thoughts about how it would be if I would be able to change the past and I wouldn’t get this illness (as I got it because I was pressing my feelings and being in relationships I didn’t fit.). I already think that I have obsessive compulsive disorder maybe if I’m so desperately trying to change the past .
I feel not normal and that I will never be myself again. I’m searching for hope. Can it be that paxil is not working and are my thoughts are normal.
As well I’m afraid to go far from home and people around for me looking so different from me.
Please write a comment or text me",1
I’ve been referred to a therapist and given some options too. I think that may be best for me,1
Especially after you specifically told her you didn’t want to take medication. Get a new doctor,1
"She said it helped with ocd, anxiety/stress, and drinking",1
It’s one of them yes,1
Me too. I’ve emailed my therapist because she said I could do so and told her about my opinions so I am waiting on that now. A thing I like to do is going outside at night and just look at stars on a clear night. It can be pretty peaceful sometimes,1
I’ve emailed my dr about not wanting to and just to take the therapist route. I’m taking that advice haha,1
It sucks.  Ruined my life,1
Horrible for me,1
Last resort. One of the hardest to quit,1
I took Paxil for 20 years. I just spent the last 5 months suffering withdrawal when it quit working.I would choose something else. I have had brain zaps for over 10 years,1
Are you still on Paxil,1
The more I learn about this drug the more horrible it sounds,1
Ocd,1
Was on 100mg Zoloft for ~5 months. I felt better with my depression (which is weird bc I really wouldn’t have thought I was depressed before) but didn’t really help with my anxiety (original reason I started). Starting 20mg paxil tomorrow,1
Are you still on Paxil? How did it end up for you,1
How’s it been now,1
I am still struggling. I tried Prozac 10 mg after trying Zoloft for awhile. It worked for awhile and now it doesn’t. I am weaning off and then I’m done with antidepressants.I still have brain zaps and I’m trying natural supplements instead of drugs. It is hard to get off Paxil. I pray you are able to have the strength to rid yourself of this,1
"Could you write me please 🙏 
I have questions about Paxil",1
Not really.  I’m  more aware now but damage has been done,1
So I’m a 19 year old female hypochondriac which makes it bad enough. I’m absolutely mortified of dying and I’ve been taking Paxil to help me with this. Recently I ran out and I’ve been desperately trying to find a psychiatrist and it’s hard. I’ve been without it for about 4 days now. I feel the usual withdrawal symptoms and I just finally got a refill on my prescription. I did some research on Paxil withdrawal and I’m genuinely mortified. Everyone is saying it’s dangerous to go cold Turkey. I even read that someone picked up a guy who was having a seizure from his withdrawals. I don’t plan on quitting cold Turkey but even to taper off??? People are saying it’s horrible. I’m so so so afraid of dying as it is and I was never warned about this when I was initially put on Paxil. I’m angry and frustrated and scared. I don’t want to be on Paxil anymore but I don’t want to fucking die? Like I’m genuinely mortified. Any suggestions? Do you guys think I’ll die or have a seizure from quitting Paxil? This is gonna send me down a spiral I can feel it.,1
"I was depressed every day, and so to feel some effect of relief, I started to double dose (I know, bad), but in doing so, I started to feel ‘normal again and not in a depressed state or constant funk. I didn’t have any motivation nor desire to go anywhere or do anything before double dosing, and so that helped to crack me out of that shell again.

Then, my prescription runs out and time for a refill. Normally, I’d refill via automated assistant at the pharmacy, then go pick them up about an hour later. Two hours passed and I didn’t hear anything from the pharmacy letting me know my PAR (Paroxetine) was ready for pick up, so I shoot on up to the store to see what’s up.

I get there and the pharmacist tells me my doctor denied the auto-refill because he wanted to see me in for a physical since I had last seen him almost 3 years prior. I told the pharmacist I needed a couple to tie me over until I could get in to see him as I knew that the tapering of the medication in my system was surely going to lead to those horrible brain zaps, which are uncomfortable, scary and I hate them. She gives me 10.

The following day I go see my doctor. We talked and I explained how I felt they were no longer working as maybe my body built up a tolerance and also that I had started double dosing. He shook his head.  He then orders me to stop the Paxil and prescribes me Zoloft at 100 mg.

Jump to current and I have now been taking the Zoloft in single pill, no doubling up. I’ve been taking the Zoloft since 7/28/2021 and yet I do not feel any difference. In fact, I feel worse. I’m crying for no reason, and just have that general Eeyore black cloud over me again.

Docs: is it safe for me to say, and to presume, that maybe I don’t feel a difference because I have not given the pills a chance to kick in? I’m probably rushing the process as I want that immediate relief of elation and for the sadness to go away. I also thought that because I was going from 20 mg to 100 mg that I would for sure feel it’s effects immediately, but no.

Anyhow, I don’t feel they’re doing their job and am not sure what to do. 7 years of Paxil versus one month exactly of Zoloft, and I don’t feel any better. Not sure what my next move should be. He told me that 100 mg of SSRI was the max dosage he could give me. What happens next?

Thanks to all who may comment.",1
"Hello everyone! I need help for a friend who was on 40mg of Paxil for 6 months. She is a 24 year old that is 5’4” and weighs 150lb. She suffered from depression, anxiety attacks, and OCD. She no longer has access to health care and can’t afford to pay for psychiatry so she was cut off cold turkey. She’s been off of Paxil for 9 days and is having some pretty severe symptoms including dissociation, nightly nightmares, and head rushes. I’m working on getting her access to this medication again. Is it recommended that she start again and then taper off or is it better to just cut cold turkey? I’m not sure what to do since it’s been 9 days already since her last 40mg dose",1
"I am a female, who is 5 ft1 and weigh 104 pounds. Anyways,  i recently began taking 10 mg of paxil for my anxiety.  I took my 2nd dose of it just last night, and today i woke up feeling high and jittery. I also have diarrhea. Is it normal to already be experiencing side affects after only taking my 2nd dose? Could this be serotonin syndrome?",1
"I was on Paxil 20 mg first then upped to 30 mg about 2 months ago. I decided to stop because my hubs and I are thinking about trying to conceive. Before Paxil, I was on zoloft for 2 years but had to stop because it was affecting my heart rhythm. I stupidly stopped the Paxil cold turkey because to be honest I did not think that 2 months could really make a difference. Yeah that was dumb.. I am nauseas, dizzy and overall feel foggy. Like my brain feels heavy. I’ve had 3 visual hallucinations now. And worst of all, I keep getting this weird sensation in my head like a pulse almost... it sounds like a sound that would be like “wub wub” that vibrates through all my whole head in the deepest bass possible. I just want to know.. how long did it take you to get over the Paxil withdrawal? Miserable over here 😭

"I have been on paxil pretty much constantly since I was around 14-15. Started anxiety meds at 12. I have been on 30mgs of paxil for a long ass time I know its been over 3 years idk if I was on 20mg beforehand or was on 30mg but I know I have been on 30mgs for over 3 years. Well my sex drive has been shitty and I have gained weight so I wanted to see if dropping down to 20mgs from 30mgs could fix those issues. Its been a week and This past week I have been having weird dreams, hot flashes, strange headaches, tummy aches, feeling anxious and uneasy. I was wondering if these symptoms are from the switch from 30mgs to 20mgs. I know paxil has some terrible withdrawals and some people even need rehab to deal with paxil withdrawals that's why they taper us but now I am unsure if you still get withdrawal symptoms with tapering cause I feel terrible.",1
"Hello,

For starters, I am a 21 year old male. I have a ~10 year history of depression and anxiety, for which I take Paxil and gabapentin.

Paxil is the fifth antidepressant that I've been put on, and, when first started it about six months ago, my psychiatrist told me that it was ""the strongest of the SSRIs."" What does that mean? And if that's true, what else could I possibly try if/when the Paxil stops working?

Thank you for your time! If more information is needed, I'd be happy to share",1
" Hi, I'm a 32 year old white male, 5'9"" and 160 lbs.  I just finished a 14 day treatment of omeprazole for GERD after being sent to the emergency room when I was unable to swallow food or water.  I was also prescribed 20mg of Paxil for anxiety.  During the course of my omeprazole treatment, I wasn't anxious and was able to eat without incident so I did not take any Paxil.  It's been three days since I finished the course of omeprazole, however, and last night I had slight difficulty swallowing some bread.  This made me somewhat anxious so I took 10mg of Paxil.  A few hours later, I felt nauseous and extremely anxious.  I was unable to sleep the entire night, only partially getting some rest from 10am to 11am.  I don't want to take any more Paxil, but I do want to be able to fall asleep.  I have melatonin, 5mg CBD gummies, as well as some promethazine from the hospital.  I'm frightened to take any of these because I know they may react with the dose of Paxil in my system.  Is there anything I can take or do?",1
"I started Paxil and immediately had horrible side effects.  I was sick to my stomach, terrible headaches, increased panic and I developed a small rash on my arm.  I ended up going to the ER twice.  The second time, they told me to discontinue the Paxil.

Immediately I started experiencing brain zaps, twitching throughout my body particularly between my eyes.  I can put my fingers on my forehead and feel my pulse and the twitching.  It's horrible.

I haven't slept at all since starting this drug.  Maybe an hour or two here or there but I'm crying all the time because I can't sleep and I'm so frustrated.

Am I broken?  Is this permanent? How much longer does this misery last?",1

Currently taking Paxil 50mg/day for panic disorder/general anxiety

I have been on Paxil since I was 15 years old.  I weaned myself down to 15mg/day a few months ago, but my symptoms returned (with a vengeance) and I had to go back up to 50mg.  3-4 years ago, I switched off of Paxil and onto Lexapro.  My anxiety was completely out of control and I was miserable, so I went back on the Paxil.

The problem?  My husband and I are ready to try for a baby.  I spoke to my psychiatrist about this, and she told me that the best thing would be to remain on Paxil for a couple reasons: 1. Untreated anxiety would be worse for my unborn child than Paxil, and 2. It is possible that if I quit Paxil and go back on it later, it will not work as well as it used to.

This seemed pretty reasonable to me, but then I talked to my OB/GYN about it.  He thinks that I should discontinue Paxil and take Zoloft instead.  I am willing to try this, but am very anxious about it because of the terrible experience I had when I tried switching to Lexapro.

So, I'm getting two completely different opinions from two experts.  What do you all think?  I really appreciate any thoughts or advice.",1
"I'ma 25 year old female, 5'2"" approximately 110lbs. I think I fucked up. I am prescribed tramadol, adderall, and recently paxil. I am also prescribed spironolactone, but I don't think that's relevant. I had horrible experiences with SSRIs in the past and didn’t want to take the paxil (it’s for anxiety). But last night after about 6 beers I decided it was a great idea to try one of the Paxil, so I took one. I didn’t think much about it this morning. I took my adderall as I always do. Then around 11 I took my tramadol (100mg) as usual along with a dramamine, and some nyquil because I have sniffles. I take a lot of nyquil for sleep issues. I can kill a big bottle by myself in like three days. I can’t remember whether or not I took a zofran today.
Now I feel really weird. My head is ringing, I’m extremely nauseous and I feel very disoriented. I am agitated and feel tingly, like I’m almost shaky and I’m really hot but cold at the same time. Almost clammy. Is this what serotonin syndrome feels like? Has anyone ever had it? Or am I way overreacting here? I don’t want an expensive ER visit if I don’t absolutely need one, but I am worried. Advice?

"I keep scratching my face, tearing my hair out, IN PUBLIC, it happens on the bus. I NEED HELP. i'm 27 years old, female, living in canada.

Four years ago I took acid for the first time and felt, in my body, a lot of sexual trauma coming from childhood. A while later I met a guy, who was 49, and when I told him about my childhood he said I should stop talking to my parents, move out (i was living with my mom at 22), come off antidepressants (I was on the same dose of paxil since age 14), and drop out of school among other things. he acted as a sort of shaman and i trusted him entirely and listened to everything he said. some things were really great and other things not and also i misinterpreted a lot of things. i started to be really honest with my mom about what was going on but i was honest in ways i shouldn't have been. the relationship detioriated. eventually the relationship with the guy turned sour, he played with me a lot and hurt me in ways i never imagined anyone would do, but i hit him. there were times he would be making out with other girls and receiving all this attention from other girls in front of me while using the blanket ""non-monogamous"" thing we agreed to in the beginning but i NEVER agreed to that, i would get so upset, one time i followed him into the bathroom at a bar and hit him in the face. i didn't realize i could actually hurt him. i thought he was invincible. it wasn't just once, i gave him a black eye one time. i felt like he had my entire soul in his hands and he just didn't give a shit, i threw away the world for him and he was literally destroying my heart every day. after he ""ghosted"" me i contacted him for a long time. he totally stopped talking to me but then would come into my work and sit at the bar and say he's meeting people there. he would meet people there, and it was a popular bar at the time, but there were so many other places he could have went. i would be at work frantic because of him literally pretending he didn't know me suddenly. eventually they fired me because they said it seemed like i didn't want to be there and my interactivity was too low, but i was just really depressed. i kept calling him a lot, randomly. he could have blocked my number but he didn't so i just kept doing it. I just wanted him to say one word. Why are you suddenly GONE?

over the summer he took a lot of drugs, apparently he was taking drugs almost every day. and smoking crack. he fell off a building. i was there for him in the hospital, and then we found out he was being used, his ""friend"" who he had been ""supporting""/""helping"" for years was actually using him entirely, he was sending every single dollar he made to him and working 24/7 because he believed his friend was a shaman/philosopher/writer who was going to change the world with his new school of thought which didn't exist, there was no project, it's all a lie. i told him all of this and he told me i'm just like everyone else in his life, they always end up thinking his ""friend"" is a user.

weeks later I got drunk and I don't remember this part but apparently I went to his house and attacked him. AFTER his fall. the police came and put me in the drunk tank. I can't live with myself. and I keep hurting myself. literally beating myself up. my family doesn't talk to me anymore. i've caused damage to their house and they believe i hit their animals but i didn't, i swear to god that is one thing i didn't do.

I'M IN SCHOOL but I keep fucking up, last night i lost my phone, my student loan is tied up because i need to update my banking information but I can't without my phone, I'm a week late on rent because of this.

Hello all. 37 y/o female here from outside Philadelphia. Weigh about 140, height is 5’2. Non-smoker although I did vape for a couple years and recently stopped. I do smoke weed. 

For the past four years I’ve been having worsening symptoms of dysautonomia, among other things. Don’t have POTS or any other typical presentation of any particular autonomic dysfunction disease. The list of symptoms include:
-weakness in arms and legs (during a flare I can completely lose the ability to stand/walk without assistance)
-breathing issues - like a weight on chest
-intolerance to heat
-excessive sweating
-pain in heat and humidity
-trouble speaking - throat feels like I’m being choked and I run out of breath. Is painful to speak for long periods- esp in throat and ears
-trouble swallowing
-right side eye droop
-muscle tremors

There are others but I’ll be typing forever if I keep going. I’m also currently dx gastroparesis and small fiber neuropathy. 
Meds are gabapentin 600ng, trazodone 50mg,Paxil 20mg,wellbutrin 150mg, low dose naltrexone, namenda titration pack, Mestinon (which helps!). 


The only other possible relevant test info is multiple brain/spine mri’s that showed small white matter hyperintensities in my brain but not my spine. Also, low ige and high free kappa light chains. 

Symptoms got much worse over the summer due to the heat and I was referred to a neuro locally. She was lovely and ordered a ton of blood work- some of which she sent to Mayo Clinic. The bloodwork showed a P/Q -type calcium channel antibody value of .11 nmo/L. 

My neuro referred me to a specialist and I had my appointment with him on Wednesday for an EMG. I gave him a 30 second rundown of my history, he did a normal EMG and decided I didn’t need the single fiber EMG. Also proclaimed there’s no way I have LEMS bc I don’t fit the phenotype. He also told me that sometimes the body can just make these antibodies as a fluke. And then told me it was probably my anxiety.

Is this real life? (Insert John Travolta confused meme here) any help would be appreciated? 

I’m happy to provide more info about symptoms , but it’s stupid long and boring. But they are severe enough to cause me to resign from my dream job and go down to part-time hours. ",1
"Hello everyone. I am a 39 male, 6'1 240 lbs, former smoker. I am currently on Lisinopril 2.5 mg, Cetirizine 10mg, Paxil 12.5 mg, and Pantoprazole 20mg. I was previously 200lbs before starting on Paxil and Lisinopril.

So about 9 months ago, I started having some strange symptoms that have gotten progressively worse over time, and have been pretty much constant  and I'm to the point where I just would almost rather die because the pain and anxiety is so great. 

The first symptom I noticed 9 months ago was that one day I woke up with extremely dry eyes and mouth. I also noticed that 2 large red veins had appeared on the inner corners of my eyes that had not been there previously. This has persisted to present day.

The next symptom that developed was a sensitivity in my hands to pressure. For example, I would lean on something for a short time, and there would be a red mark that lasts for way longer than it should. It started out as painless, but in the next 8 months it has developed into constant pain, burning and numbness constantly in the palms of my hands. There are also times when my palms appear completely red. There was one day in particular when I had a really high fever, and the burning sensation spread from my core to my hands and during this fever, my hands went completely numb. Since this happened, the numbness and tingling has been pretty much constant.

I have also had a constant dull pain in the middle of my chest, as well as the upper left abdomen, just below the rib cage. This pain has persisted since I was first vaccinated for Covid in 2021, in which immediately after, I contracted Covid. There was a period after I got sick that I developed pneumonia, which was likely made worse by the fact that I worked in a -20 degree freezer doing order filling at this time. This constant pain in my core is probably my biggest concern at this point, as it makes me feel constantly that I'm not okay.

My blood pressure has been wildly inconsistent, going from 120/70 all the way up to 170/100 at different points during the day. There have been 3 or 4 times that I have been to the ER with a BP of over 200/110. 

Notable things with blood tests include high cholesterol, high triglycerides, and elevated WBC on multiple tests done at different points in these last 9 months.

I also have an osteoma bone tumor on my skull on the right parietal bone, which has been growing at a steady rate. There is pain in the skull, as well as audible squishing when pressing around this area. Doctors have this far dismissed it as a cosmetic defect only, although I suspect it may be more than that.

Other random symptoms include joint pain, especially in the fingers and thumbs. Left knee pain, and random tensing of my left foot, especially when driving or in a sitting position.

I'm looking for advice on what I should tell my doctor, because thus far they haven't seemed to take my symptoms seriously and have prescribed me anxiety medication which actually does nothing to make me feel better. This feels like a purely physical issue and not like it's in my head at all.

Any thoughts on what my issue could be or doctor advice would be much appreciated. Thanks for taking a look.",1
"32f, 5’4, about 137lbs. Taking Paxil, klonopin, Zyrtec, and birth control. I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy this morning and woke up with an itchy eye apparently, right eye. I did rub it and it was very weepy at the time. Now it’s been 9 hours (most of which I’ve been asleep for) and it’s still blurry and scratchy feeling also a little bit of a burning sensation. Everything seems a bit fuzzy in that eye and it feels like some very light sandpaper when I blink or have it closed. I was under sedation with propofol if that helps. ",1
"I (22F) have a chronic breathing issue that I would like to ask about here. I been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, adhd, possible type 2 bipolar disorder and take concerta, Paxil, and LamoTRIgine daily, and Albuterol Sulfate HFA Inhalation Aerosol when needed. Family does have history of childhood asthma with my 2 brothers and father having it. I do not smoke and very rarely drink.

My condition developed when I was in highschool, it started off mild and I coped with it for about a year and a half while it slowly got progressively worse. I finally went to the doctor for it when it got so bad I was in such discomfort I could not function in my day to day life. I went to my pediatrician at the time who did an x-ray to see what was going on, I remember her saying that my lungs were much longer than normal but that she didn’t exactly know the cause and prescribed me an inhaler. I had to take it every 4 hours for weeks until it settled down, and I now take it as needed whenever it flares up.

It flares up mostly randomly, but I’ve observed it tends to flare up if I haven’t eaten much for a few days (I don’t eat a lot sometimes for various reasons. My adhd meds dampen my appetite, and at times I have periods where no food sounds even remotely appetizing to me leading me to not eat much. Which is probably also due to my adhd since I tend to get hyperfixations on foods). I might have developed adolescent asthma but I am unsure as the symptoms don’t exactly fit, and I am especially concerned about the lung thing. I’ve looked it up and found information about hyperinflated lungs but all the information I found says that it cause lungs to expand outwards not down. 

When I get flare ups I do get shortness of breath, when it’s mild I have to yawn every so often to take a deep enough breath to be able to feel like I’ve gotten enough air. When it gets really bad no matter what I try I feel like I’m slowly suffocating. I do not experience any wheezing, and my breathing stays at a moderate speed even during bad flare ups, I also do not breath through my mouth unless I need to take a deep breath. I do sometimes develop a cough after strenuous exercise, but normally do not have one even with flare ups. I do not feel chest pressure, my extreme flare ups do cause my heart rate to increase, and have caused both mild and extreme anxiety, the worst leading to a fairly severe anxiety attack. I do not ever experience pain during flare ups, and at worse feel extreme discomfort.

Anyways I may be over analyzing this and may have just developed asthma in my adolescence which caused some weird lung hyperinflation. But I thank anyone who has read all of this and if anyone has any insight into this I would be extremely grateful to hear them out, even if it’s just confirmation that it is asthma! C:",1

For the past month, my mom has been having delusions and paranoia - she is unaccepting of reality even after she is shown evidence. She is convinced people who have never met her are out to get her, stating they are using witchcraft and black magic. She has stated that she is having dreams of God instructing her to do specific tasks/missions (i.e. starting a ministry even though she has no religious background and is not a member of a church) and is convinced that social media posts have special meaning to or about her. 

Physical symptoms: severe stomach pain, profuse sweating, hand tremors, insomnia, pale face (when I mentioned this, she said her blood pressure was “a little low”). She has lost a lot of weight and said her pills have been reduced. Before the delusions, I assumed the medication changes were doctor-advised — now, I am not sure that they were. She did tell me that she went from taking 3 Klonopin daily to 1 (unsure of when she changed dosage) and when I told her how dangerous that was, she said she went back up to 2/day. I know that the process of tapering needs to be under a doctor’s supervision.

She has been unwilling to see a doctor for the neurological issues as she believes she is thinking clearly and that everyone else will be proven wrong. She states all of the physical symptoms above are from her medications. The delusions seem to be more severe during what I would describe as ‘episodes’ — any progress that seems to be made in convincing her of what is “real” in between is lost when she gets back on the topic.

I have called 911 who arrived and would not take her since she was not a threat to herself or others. She is otherwise functioning (bathing, eating - but not very much, driving, grocery shopping, holding conversations unrelated to the delusions).

Are there any explanations for this that are medically obvious? Is there anything else I can legally do to get her help (that she doesn’t want)? She has an upcoming appt with her kidney/hypertension doctor on the 17th, and I am counting down the days and hoping she doesn’t cancel. I just want to help my mom.

Thank you for reading.",1
"hello, a few days ago (almost a week ago), i ate a bunch of sugar and im 99% sure i had a sugar crash. i felt sick, dizzy, nauseous. etc. it happened again. (to be fair i ate a lot of sugar again.) but for the past few days, i’ve felt crappy. tired, sometimes i feel dizzy, not even dizzy. i just feel off. i get nauseous. but i’m not eating bad. i’m not losing any weight, not peeing a ton, etc. but apart of me is concerned and convinced it’s diabetes. my grandma had type 2 and did not take care of it well. and my health anxiety is not helping. to be fair i just worked a 55+ hour week. maybe it’s my meds? my anxiety? my body being tired? i AM on paxil (for 2+ months), and i do feel crappy. i really am not sure. i have an appointment the 22nd, and it hasn’t gotten worse. has anyone been through this? with meds, anxiety, etc?

"Hi all, I’m a 29yo female, 125 lbs, 5”6. Currently on 60mg Zoloft, 30mg Lamictal, 15mg propranolol, 15mg Valium, 15mg Mirtazapine. Clonazepam (sublingual) PRN,  ondanestron PRN, propranolol PRN. 

I’ve had treatment resistant panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder since I was 8 (diagnosed, had symptoms earlier). Major depressive disorder since I was 23. Agoraphobia started around then too. Also IBS-D since I was a child, officially diagnosed after a scope in 2020. In 2022-2023 I had 4 recurrent CDI involving 2 hospitalizations and was officially diagnosed with PTSD from this. 

I have been on so many medications to try to treat these illnesses, as well as trying many types of therapy. I’ve seen 3-4 psychiatrists through my life, including specialists at a teaching hospital. I’ve had 10+ therapists.

Drugs I’ve been on since I was 8, and I may be forgetting some: (apologies for spelling)

SSRIs: Lexapro (worsened IBS), Prozac (worsened IBS), Zoloft, Celexa, Paxil, Viibryd

Atypical antidepressants: Wellbutrin, Mirtazapine

SNRIs: Pristiq (bad reaction), Cymbalta, Effexor

Tricyclic: Nortyptyiline (sp)

Atypical antipsychotics: Olanzapine, Seroquel, Risperdal (tardive dyskinesia), Rexulti (bad reaction- intrusive thoughts began), Abilify 

Mood stabilizers: Lamictal

Benzodiazepines: Lorazepam, Clonazepam, Diazepam (unwanted physical dependence’s) 

ADHD meds: Ritalin (dystonia), Adderal

Beta-blocker: Propranolol

Therapies I’ve tried: CBT, DBT, psychotherapy, family therapy, mindfulness, meditation, group therapy, exposure therapy, a PHP program and two IOPs.

My psychiatrist now wants me to replace Zoloft with trintellix. I’m currently in an IOP for the PD and MDD. I want to believe that we can find a medication that helps but it’s been 20 years of this with no luck and a lot of the time when I try new meds I have bad reactions. I stick with it to reach the therapeutic effects but they end up not helping and consuming my day. To be clear it’s not just me saying my symptoms aren’t being relieved, it’s my doctor too, saying that medication isn’t helping. 

When you have patients like me, do you truly think you can find a medication or a cocktail that will relieve symptoms? I am hopeful for improvement but realistically I’m thinking, why would something work now, whatever is going on hasn’t been helped. Why would my doc want to start me on a new med given every single other med has never worked?

Also my psych put me on 10mg propranolol to help with the symptoms of anxiety and I read I shouldn't eat potassium foods... but my anxiety keeps me from eating much so I usually eat fruits or smoothies. 

Last question is it ok for me to take Magnesium Glycinate 100mg at night to help with anxiety and sleeping? I tend to wake up with anxiety and my Psych said it night help... 

Just need to know I am ok ❤️ I appreciate any Dr who can help calm my nerves. A guy in a different group said I had acidosis and it really freaked me out cause idk where he came up with that and I don't want to die. I really appreciate anyone who can just help me out",1
"Male, age 21.


I used to take Paxil (10mg) for Anxiety, but I stopped taking it many months ago.


It's hard to describe what it's like, it feels like random moments of complete and utter confusion. I forget how to do basic work tasks, I make extremely, extremely poor decisions that at the time, I felt were acceptable. It's happened so frequently in my life that it's starting to affect my life.


An example from work today:


i was asked to do a set up containing 6 tables that form a large rectangle ( so not pushed together). As I went to go and do it, I realized I didn't know *how* to do it. Like, my mind just couldn't figure out how to make a rectangle out of 6 tables. I go off to do other parts of the set up while my co-worker did the 6 table part. When I came back and saw how he did it, I got really concerned for myself. How did I *not know* how to do that? I've worked this job for years. I've done very similar set-ups with no problems before. How could this happen?


Another time, I'm riding with a co-worker and we're dropping something off at the office. As we're driving, I'm not quite too sure what happened to me, but I said ""wait, we have to drop this thing off at the office."" and he says ""dude, are you okay?"" and I realize we're right in front of the office. I tried to pass it off as a joke, but it really fucking scared me. I want to say maybe it felt like I didn't even know where I was for a few seconds, but maybe I just wasn't focusing? I don't know. 


these kinds of things happen frequently, along with me having a poor memory, and pronouncing basic words strangely/completely wrong,  leads me to think there's something severely wrong with my mind. it feels like my mind is half deteriorated, and my consciousness feels floaty. I don't really know how to describe it. This doesn't happen *all* the time though, very very rarely, I feel like my mind works as it should, my mind feels clear and I'm able to process things better. what's wrong with my brain?",1

"Hi there, I'm 27M residing in Australia. I'm 171cm tall, 75kg, and white caucasian. My complaint is a bit different and I worry it could be nerve damage or something. I've had this happen for a while but has been happening more often, particular this last week. Previously I noticed when I'm in hotels or at elevated heights it would feel like my legs couldn't hold my weight, I'd get this weird brain shock and I'd slightly buckle, this would happen in random spurts. This weird vertigo or sudden light feeling has maybe been around for over a year but most notably this was a complaint I gave to my mum back in July/August of last year since it had become more noticeable. I've had tinnitus for as long as I can remember as well. Fast forward to today, I've noticed moving my eyes/head causes this electric shock through my chest, and down to my arms sometimes giving me pins and needles for a couple seconds. It's not long lasting, maybe only for a second, it's only ever so brief but it happens rapidly. If I'm standing it feels like I need to grab for something to hold me up - I've never fallen to the ground due to it though, it isn't THAT bad. The shock reminds me of when I was coming off SSRI's, but not quite. It's like a buzzing shock, it's not painful but irritating. It sometimes reaches my feet. Stretching also does it.

My tinnitus has been worse this week and I wonder if I have an infection, but it doesn't feel like my ears are blocked. My fatigue this week has been really bad. I'm not the best at sleeping but the fatigue is intense. I'm currently on Nexium for GORD which has been life-long. I used to be on Paxil for anxiety-depression but have been off for 2.5-3 years now. I do drink on the weekends, I have been smoking for 6 months (I'm going to stop this fearing this might be causing my problem), and I do recreationally take drugs every few months at festivals. I'm currently on no supplements but had been on Vitamin D, magnesium/calcium, and iron in the past. D/Iron being the ones my doctor told me to get - maybe it's iron deficiency? 

Moving my eyes side to side also seems to change the sound around me. Closing my eyes and doing it seems like there's a faint swoosh going through my head but I kind of have to focus on doing that to get to that point. Just now, it felt as if my head was building in pressure and the pitch in sound seemed off, then corrected itself.

In all, it's very uncomfortable and is distracting me - I will appreciate any answers or questions. Please recommend what sort of specialist I may need to see if this persists! 

Thank-you!!",1
"35M, 5'10""/265lbs, White. Lab results from this morning show significant increase in TSH (from 2.51 in July to 4.11 today) and Triglycerides (from 319 in July to 619 today). I have Bipolar Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Complex Sleep Apnea (treated with CPAP), mild HS, and GERD. I smoke about a pack a day (obtained RX for Chantix this morning!) and drink occasionally, with rare use of cannabis gummies. 

My medications are as follows: 

Lithium, 600mg in the morning and 750mg at night  
Seroquel, 150mg at night  
Buspirone, 5mg morning and night  
Paxil, 30mg every morning  
Dexilant, 30mg every morning  
Lipitor, 10mg every night  
Truvada, 200/300mg every night  
Zinc, 50mg morning and night  
Turmeric, 1,270mg every night  
Fish oil every morning

&#x200B;

Graphs showing the change over time in my TSH and triglycerides are [here](https://imgur.com/a/qshpQyP). 

Essentially I've seen what seem to me very significant, even sudden, increases in both my TSH and triglycerides. 

My lithium levels have consistently remained in the correct range (no graphics, those are ordered by my psychiatrist and he doesn't use MyChart). My dosage was increased from 600mg twice a day to add another 150mg at night a couple of months ago; my lithium level was 1.0 about a week after that dosage increase and prior to the increase had been lower, always within the safe range. 

My eGFR, BUN, and Creatinine have always been within normal ranges. Today those numbers were 99, 13, and 1.01 respectively. They do fluctuate slightly over time, up or down, but are always within the normal ranges. 

With my TSH rising over time, I'm becoming concerned about the safety of continuing lithium treatment. It's the only medication that has allowed me any significant degree of stability. I previously tried most of the other medications (antipsychotics, anticonvulsants) that are commonly used for Bipolar Disorder and the results weren't good. The thought of not taking lithium and returning to my previous life, or maybe not living very long as a result, really scares me. 

But I understand why my thyroid function could be decreasing, I've always been aware of the risks of long term lithium treatment. I guess I just got used to seeing no change for so long (I've been taking lithium for ten years) that I assumed it would never happen to me.

What I don't understand is the increase in triglycerides. My weight hasn't increased significantly (258 last July and 264 today). My diet hasn't changed, though it obviously needs to. The graph shows that it's a pretty big jump from July. I'm hoping that quitting smoking will help both with lowering my triglycerides and increasing my HDL. My LDL and total cholesterol are in the normal range (15 and 120, respectively). 

Now, I did go to a convention with some friends this weekend. From Thursday afternoon until Sunday night I was eating worse than I normally do, drinking a significant amount of alcohol, and getting very little sleep. And on my way to my appointment this morning I drank an energy drink so I wouldn't fall asleep while driving. I know that all affected my blood sugar, which is why I'm not concerned that it was high this morning. But could those factors account for the increase in TSH and triglycerides? I wouldn't think so. 

I sent my doctor a message and asked to get the labs redone in a couple of days, that way I won't have a bunch of extra sugar or anything else in me, I can fast and get proper levels. I didn't think I'd be getting labs done today otherwise I would've done that. 

Is the increase in TSH an indication that my thyroid is going to stop working soon? If I develop hypothyroidism, will function return if I stop taking lithium? If I stop taking lithium now will it prevent my thyroid function from decreasing further? 

Is there a possible connection between TSH and triglycerides or is it a coincidence that they're going up at the same time? 

Does this ridiculous increase in triglycerides make me eligible to take Vascepa and would that help? Is it possible that this spike in triglycerides is temporary like the previous fluctuations?  

Is anything else I'm taking potentially harming my thyroid or increasing my triglycerides (besides Seroquel, which I know has potential to affect cholesterol)? Is it alright to go ahead and take the Chantix that I was prescribed, or is that likely to further affect my thyroid or raise my triglycerides?   


I don't expect anyone to have all the answers but I'll be very appreciative of any feedback! Nobody ever answers my questions here, it's getting really discouraging. Thanks.

"24M, height & weight - don't know, but I remember BMI is 22, use vape only, drink max 2 to 3 per week since 3 months.

Almost every day when I wake up I am confused - it's like I am in a dream. I'm extremely exhausted and sleepy all the time. Usually I regain some focus and motivation for life when I'm hungry, but whenever I eat I am immediately dizzy and completely disassociated. It's been getting worse the past two weeks. I also get riming in my ears. It feels even more like I'm in a dream and everyone around me is not real or a robot. I am completely conscious but I feel like I could do any stupid shit and not feel ashamed for it. The last time this happened I went to sleep for a about 4 hours, had two energy drinks and was better. But that's not always the case... Sometimes I'm in this state for 3 days at a time - just lying in my bed unable to fall asleep, but also whenever I try to do something it's too difficult. On rare occasions, usually after I drink alcohol, I wake up completely conscious and ready to take on the day - hop in the shower, brush, and get out... however that only lasts till like 4 pm. Usually as soon as it gets dark I am exhausted and just sleep sleep while waking up every two hours. Throughout my waking state I keep overthinking, feeling extremely lonely... it's like a cycle of intrusive thoughts and nightmares. Showering and whatever is a mentally exhausting chore. Conversely, on the days that I'm out and doing normal human stuff I'm either completely zoned out and tired or motivated for a while and then just back to a sad state. I don't know where one day begins and ends. The night and day are equally terrifying. My circadian rhythm is whack. Sometimes I wake up at 8 pm, other times at 4 am. I'm also constantly hungry or dizzy, but don't feel like eating, and when I do I am uncomfortably tired. Like I'm loosing control... Amongst all this I get episodes of intense sense of impending doom. Sometimes I wake up with a panic attack... Right now I don't know what I'm focusing on... It's like my brain is functional (as I'm writing this) - but I'll think of something and forget it in the next 10 seconds. It takes severe effort to even try to remember what I was thinking. What should I do? I can't stand this feeling... And yes, I did go to a bunch of doctors - both physical and mental - they basically told me nothing is wrong with me. I used to think it's the alcohol, but ever since I ""stopped"" (ever had max 3 beers per day), meaning no more than 2 glasses of wine and 6 beers in the past three weeks, literally nothing has improved. If anything it's worse... I'm tired all the time... I wouldn't say I am exactly depressed - I actually do have the motivation to go out and meet people... But thinking about meeting them until that point makes me feel like I would just be blabbering incoherent ideas and staring around the room. However, on a few occasions that I got proper ready and went out, like yesterday, I realized I'm not missing out. Completely lost motivation to even get food. I just drank (after a long time - 2 beers only) and went to sleep. Woke up super happy, alert, motivated for life - but that feeling was short lived. Actually today morning I was super normal. Currently haven't eaten the whole day, but even thinking of food makes me wanna puke. Also haven's shat in like 3 days, but again, don't even feel the need to... except the fact that my stomach hurts and even if I drink water it feels like it would come back up.

Now. My doc did prescribe Paxil - based on godknows what criteria... I mean the consultation was literally 5 minutes. I've taken it once a few days back - severe dirrhea and nausea. I was even more of a zombie, did not improve any ""depressive"" mood. I am afraid to take it again cause I don't know for how long I'll be f\*cked up. I keep on thinking I have somewhere to be, even tho I really don't (it's holidays)... this thought goes through my head the whole day long. Can't sleep. Can't stay awake. Stuck in a constant loop of I wanna die, I can't concentrate on anything, nobody can help me, I wanna run away from this house and my family... which bring me to my next point - they keep making noise and watching TV on full volume 24/7. I keep waking up. Don't have ANY privacy, haven't slept properly in ages. Constantly feeling cold and dizzy. It's like imagine you're sleeping and someone is constantly poking you with a stick or talking on a loudspeaker right next to you. It's like I leave the house out of pure exhaustion, but once outside, it's just more exhaustion to get back and sleep... and hence they cycle repeats. I have zero friends to talk to. Lost motivation to even use social media. Just browsing reddit... feeling dizzy, like I'm in a dream, nothing is real, headache, blurry vision, restless, cycle of repetitive thoughts. 

I swear I am NOT on drugs. I'm being as clean as I can. I only use vape. One of the docs thought I was on drugs lmao... I was not... And at the doctor was same state as now - I fixed it 4 hours later by drinking an energy drink and using vape - instant clarity. But when I went to sleep I kept getting paranoia, panic attack, overthinking, spiralling into madness like nothing is real and a sense of impending doom.

PLEASE. What is wrong with me??? ANY sort of tip on how to solve this would be greatly appreciated!

I've had this before... Like two years ago... but never for longer than 2 hours, and I somehow just managed it. Yes, I did live alone back then and had a very busy schedule with multiple jobs. But it was sunny and I was happy... despite occasionally this weird state. 

Plz help. Feeling restless and panic attack. Not severe but constantly on the verge of crying and I wanna break my hands and shit. Filled with rage as well. Don't know what to do, where to go to relieve this. And literally don't give a f\*ck about anything. 

Also I want to mention - I've had this tiredness and sickness a few months ago. But then I at least had somewhat of a schedule - every day get up, have tea or energy drink, I enjoyed watching youtube videos, then go for a walk and come back. NOW. Showering is easier, meeting people is easier etc. But the beginning of one day and the next is blurred. I no longer enjoy YT or walking... and there's nothing to reset my thoughts day/night cycle. It's like a week goes by and I feel exactly the same as I did a week ago. Imagine I watch a video about North Korea - i'll be in this North Korea mood for days. Normally it'd go away after sleeping/dreaming. But now it doesn't.... 

Also I used to be wayyyy more anxious back then. Now I am calm... or calmer... but also not doing anything. It's like the panic fuelled me, but also made me distrustful of everyone. Now I'm super sweet and cuddly, but alas, a zombie.

I've had a really productive day yesterday, thought this motivation would fuel me till today, like sleep happily and with a sense of completion, get up motivated for life, don't break the cycle, get it under control.... But it all just fell apart. 

Right now I wanna sleep again. But if I lie down, I won't. The darkness, cold, panic will come back. I'll think I'm lonely and that I should have gone out to meet people. If I do force myself to do that, I'll regret it though. Then anxiously wait till morning light until exhaustion takes over.

My head feels heavy btw. ",1

Today I wore leggings, and while I was out to lunch my upper thigh was itchy….

"Gender: MAge: 24Height: \~ 175 cmWeight: \~ 65 kg

Tobacco for 2 years, vape for 4 months. Alcohol daily, although \~80% of the time not more than 5.4 units per day (two beers).

So here's the thing: every day soon after waking up, I get severe hand trembling, shortness of breath, trouble concentrating. I feel like I'm gonna vomit, feeling dizzy, and everything almost feels surreal. It's been this severe only since about a month or two at max.

Sometimes I get this when I take a 3 pm nap - I get up feeling an unbearable feeling of impending doom. I want to kill myself. Basically almost always after sleeping. Being in a half asleep, half awake state - unwanted thoughts flooding my mind, FOMO, jealousy of others, low-self esteem.

This level of these symptoms started about a month ago. And although I've been drinking pretty much daily - 5.4 units per day, due to insomnia, it was never this bad. Recently I've been binging weekly - at least 12 units over the course of two days, could be as high as 20, for at least a month or two. And while I've gone partying many times, had many shots on a birthday, I NEVER had these hand tremors and INSANE anxiety at any time over the past 4 years until these past two months. Yes I had severe hangovers, slight trembling (although that used to happen only when I left the house, mind you), but nothing like this.

The worst effects happen almost always two hours before work. I will get up at least 4 hours before work, and start thinking of having to get ready and reach there on time... Overthinking and procrastinating every detail (like which toothpaste to use) for basically two hours at least\*. I also have 90 to 180 mg of caffeine† and vape to ""get in the mood"" - otherwise I'm like a zombie. Yes, these effects also kinda coincide with me switching to nicotine salt rather than just nicotine, although I switched months ago.

\*People around me claim I have ADHD and OCD, although that could as well be a self-fulfilling prophecy. It really does make me feel worthless and self-conscious tho :(

†It's crazy cause on the days I don't sleep (there are loads of those), I can literally chug 3 to 4 times that amount, vape for half an hour non stop and feel on the top of my world! Usually that also happens when I leave the house and am alone in the forest.

In case it helps, 3 days ago on one such pre-work mornings disasters, my blood pressure reading was: 165 systolic, 94 diastolic, bpm 122. I have no idea what any of this means btw. I just copied the readings.

I drank about 15 units yesterday, although spaced over about 3 hours. I slept, woke up feeling a bit nauseous (the usual, but nothing major), felt absolutely amazing afterwards, went to sleep. I wake up 4 hours later with the same ""symptoms"" as described above, although less severe (machine readings: 149, 74, 105). I did not go work - I took my morning time to relax, breathe, take caffeine slowly etc. maybe that's why it was less severe? After that I again drank 4 units (20 hours post last drop) in hopes of reducing my ""symptoms"", thinking I'm going through withdrawal - it worked for two hours and it was back, then had 2 units in some ""tapering"" attempt...

\*\*\*

Basically I want to quit alcohol. But it helps me with social anxiety, but at the same time causes anxiety, and also potentially withdrawal. It's a vicious cycle I'm stuck in, I wanna get out. This is not the way to live.

Because here's the thing I am absolutely TERRIFIED of withdrawal. That's also the reason I did not stop drinking - I am scared to. I feel like if I don't drink in the evening, I will wake up dead the next day. And this has given me SEVERE anxiety and overthinking. And not just that - I'll be completely fine, but as soon as I pass a group of five people I feel extremely self conscious of every action I make. Sometimes when I go to a shop, I again start physically trembling at the very thought of having to speak to the cashier. This has been going on since COVID lockdown - I cannot talk to strangers anymore. I don't trust anyone. But randomly, sometimes I'll be completely confident... although quite rarely. Usually after not sleeping for 24 hours (still drinking though).

\*\*\*

Anyway, after I awoke post my 2 units ""tapering"" I had a sense of impending doom again, overthinking about having to get ready and go out etc. extreme irritability. I said ""screw it"" - took a big dose of caffeine (it helped with the impending doom, but gave me anxiety), almost fainted in the shower due to shortness of breath and that feeling of surrealism... Went for a long walk - and now besides being hungry I am almost completely fine. Just muscle aches and overthinking again... But none of that impending doom stuff. I'm exhausted/tired but not ""sleepy"". I can feel I'm hungry but zero appetite (did not eat a single thing since 29 hours). Readings: 150, 87, 72.

Here is the thing - do I drink now or go to sleep? I just don't wanna have those ""symptoms"" again (refer to my bpm, bp readings, hand trembling, shortness of breath, and feeling like ""oh god no way this is real, this can't be happening"")

Please advise. I'm terrified of having withdrawal (if that's what this is)... but also I wanna sleep and not have anxiety tomorrow. What do I do?

P.S. Some psych gave me Paxil for anxiety - but that was after 30 seconds of consultation, zero tests, and completely disregarded my concerns about alcohol withdrawal. Should I take it? I'm terrified of this stuff too, so if it's not anxiety I'm experience and it is indeed withdrawal, I'd rather not start. He also gave me Quetiapine ""to help me sleep"". Can I mix these with my current situation? Not to mention it sounds addictive, and Wikipedia states: ""Despite being widely used as a sleep aid due to its sedating effect, the benefits of such use do not appear to generally outweigh the side effects.""

On two occasions I was literally tripping balls after drinking 3 to 4 glasses (250 ml each) of wine... And I just remembered, I took 0.8 mg of melatonin on both those occasions before going to sleep (like first time). The second time was yesterday.

On the one hand, I feel like me overthinking all this (when I've done it for 4 years and been fine most the time) is what's causing me these ""symptoms""... But then again will overthinking give you diarrhoea, difficulty breathing, hand trembles, disconnected from reality, seeing stars, light-headedness, sense of impending doom, chest pain, irritability?

Another explanation that occurred to me while googling: heavy metal poisoning from sketchy Chinese vapes.

Another one, but just for the stomach issue: Giardia infection, or something of that sort? Someone once explained to me that these types of infections cause that ""in the stomach"" anxiety / butterfly feelings.

Online self symptoms checker points to: GAD, hyperthyroidism, iron deficiency.

Can anyone figure out what's wrong with me??

Should I go to ER? I mean now that I'm capable of walking before that shit comes back.

Am I in danger if I go to sleep?

"Using my anonymous account for obvious reasons. 

21F, 5’9, 220lbs, taking Sprintec birth control, Buspar, Paxil, and gabapentin. 

I’ve had some very irregular poops lately, and have had on and off stomach pain for nearly a week. The pain is sharp, similar to bloating, but much more intense. In the beginning, when my stomach started cramping, I wasn’t really having any notable poops. Now though, I’ve had almost exclusively diarrhea. I was also extremely nauseous at first, and now it’s a lot less significant but still there.

This started last week while I was on a trip out of town. I’ve had a history of constipation for as long as I can remember, and when I travel it can sometimes flare up. I also had a pretty significant panic attack while on the trip. I’ve had panic attacks for as long as I can remember as well, and constipation can sometimes follow one. Idk if it’s worth mentioning, but I also took a Plan B pill while on the trip too. 

I babysit pretty frequently, and the boy I watch had a stomach virus around the same time as I’ve had my issues. He ended up going to the ER while I was on my trip due to dehydration. I watched him before going on my trip, so I could have potentially caught something from him. 

Lately, I’ve been fine mentally, so no panic attacks, and I’ve been feeling relatively okay besides the stomach pain, diarrhea, and nausea. Right now I just want to get better, and idk what route to take. I have no idea what’s causing this, so I’m not sure how to treat it. My mom is a nurse, and she recommends I take a lot of miralax “until it runs clear” to try and “flush it out”, and she believes I’m constipated. Is this a good idea? I took 2 capfuls of Miralax a few days ago (not all at once), and it didn’t really make a difference and I’m still having diarrhea. We have pepto but I’ve yet to take any in case constipation is the problem. 

Any advice is appreciated, and thanks in advance! Do you think this is caused by a stomach virus, constipation, or maybe just stress? The Plan B pill maybe? How should I treat it? Right now I’m only drinking lots of water and eating very bland foods. Should I continue that and just let it run it’s course?",1
"So I have a tooth that is gonna be removed in 2 days due to a cavity (not infected or at least wasn't infected when we did the checkup)

In preparation for it I was given antibiotics and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation to help the anesthesia do its job in spite of the cavity

I just took the medication, and my body temperature dropped to 34.5C in an hour or two, which is really low (I have AC on but it doesn't usually bring down my body temperature). I'm getting cold sweats, I feel like I'm in a sauna (humidity is high right now), but other than that I feel absolutely fine

I have taken Prednisone quite a bit when my asthma got bad and I never had any problems 

I'm currently under a few blankets even though I feel like I'm burning up, because I think that's what I should do

Anyways, worrying or not? Any way to alleviate the symptoms? Should I keep taking those meds ? (Probably should)

Does anyone have any commentary, suggestions, ideas, or things that might be missing or forgotten.  I have to admit that I do have health anxiety and since training in emergency medical response it had increased.  I live in a small Northern town and am terrified of getting over looked or under referred or under diagnosed... and am really cognizant of the amount of young women who are a.) just experiencing life altering illnesses at young ages and b.) tragically dismissed when experiencing such.  So, I really appreciate any thoughts on the following.  I have received really great care thus far - especially in the ER last night but wouldn't feel right if I didn't try to access the resources I have access to before my upcoming appointment.  Thank you so very much in advance!

February ended up in hospital with puke/poops and dehydration which was written as gastroenteritis... ended up having some anti-nausea and was give some fluids - felt amazing after the fluid.  Few days later had broken a tooth, had to go to dentist bc it was a previous root canal - was given Amoxicillin 500mg 3x / day - took with no issues.  This is important for later.  Never had issues with anti-biotics, no known allergies, no known drug allergies.

Leading up to this I was experiencing extreme thirst, so much thirst, was drinking a lot of water.  I've always had issues with my sugar consumption, esp in relation to juice.  In early March I had blood work ordered because I was worried about blood sugars and possible diabetes.  Blood work ordered - I didn't do the blood work promptly.

End of March 2023 - travelled to UK, was ill upon arrival - presented with strep like symptoms, spots on tonsils, fever, chills, unable to control body temp., extreme night sweats, body aches, etc. - this resolved in 2 or so days, sinus stuffiness throughout the trip...  During the trip I didn't have much appetite and tend to not when travelling - also didn't enjoy the traditional family foods - lost about 20 pounds over a week... granted there was A LOT of walking, some days upward of 17KMs, trip to London, etc.  I tried to keep up as best I could but was definitely not able to as I would have normally.

Also then ended up getting sick on the way home.. which I attributed to the long dry flight... my throat was sore and raw, started smoking again when I got back so thought that likely had something to do with it but was also night sweating, congested, etc.

Once I arrived home a there was one day my husband went to bear-hug me and hugged me very tightly and unexpectedly and cracked my upper back - between shoulder blades - it took my breath away and i hugged him because I didn't want my legs to give out underneath me.  After this I noticed my feet were very tingly and numb in places.  At first it kind of migrated from the bottoms and tops but then it just kind of settled in a persisted for about 2 to 3 weeks.  This along with the previous concerns around blood sugar and diabetes prompted me to do the blood work and urine.

\- Random glucose was 5.6

= Hemo A1C was 5.3

April 14 blood work came back pretty normal aside from very slight abnormalities - things that flagged:

\- MCH LO @ 27.4

\- Platelet HI @ 408

Urine came back with:

\- Blood (prob bc I was starting my period)

\- Positive for enterococcus species

\- Postive for group B strep

I have been prone to UTIs and have had an ongoing pain in my power left stomach for 2 or so years - they flare up, have had kidney stones, etc.  So, thought it was exactly that - another UTI.  I end up having so much pelvic pain for so long that it becomes normal and then get on anti-biotics, the inflammation and swelling goes down, the bloat goes down, and my pelvis, and back feel a ton better -  this has occurred before.

April 16 I started Amoxicillin 500mg 3X / day.  1.5 days in my legs started to present hives - obviously looked it up and saw the relation between ammox and hives.  Let it be over the weekend and then went back to the clinic the following Monday.  I will include photos.

April 25 I was give Macrobid for 5 days (don't recall #), Bilaxten, and Betamethasone cream - proceeded with this.

Proceeded as normal.  UTI seems to have resolved - feeling a lot better in that way.  Trying to stay hydrated.  The ""hives"" that presented with the Amox had persisted - each evening they would get itchy and I would scratch, they would bruise.  I had bruises all over my lower body, ""hives "" all over lower body - butt and legs - and then own sores where I had scratched.  The ""hives"" were presenting in two ways, little small raised pin point red spots and then larger blotchy raised what looked like welts - all would bruise.  Joints have also flared up and have brusies and welts, very sore to bend and move - swollen.  I will include a photo.

Last week around May 4-5 the welts continued to persist, kind of ""flaring"" up in the evenings - I was taking an OTC allergen that was not really helping so I stopped.  Continued to use to cream that was also not really helping.  Showering would hurt them, hot water would hurt.

May 8 my feet started swelling, my joints were very sore, the welts that I had scratched were bruised and my left ankle was extremely swollen and stiff.  The swelling started to spread toward my feet and toes.

I called a telehealth service, described symptoms and details - was advised to go to hospital.  I wanted to wait until today AM to go to the clinic but the nurse was adamant - so we went at 9:30PM.

Went into ER, vitals stable and normal.  Was admitted to ER.  Older ER doc took a look and was pretty shocked, brought another guy in... said it was purpura and was not blanching.  Will include photos.  He said that I was too old for Henoch-Schönlein despite it being all over my lower body, etc.  Said it could be Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura.  Ordered blood work and urine.

Had blood work done - didn't see it but was told nothing abnormal.  No comments on urine.

They ended up taking more blood, prescribing me with a heavy step down plan of prednisone to help combat (what I understand) is my immune response... causing petechia under my skin.  They settled on what they think is vasculitis... took a punch skin biopsy... referred me to internal medicine... and sent me home.  Provided prednisone before I went home.  Felt like what I thought was some relief within minutes but idk if it was psychosomatic and I was desperate lol.

Anyway... day 1 of pred. step down plan... waiting for IM appointment on May 26... and living with these... legs.

"I work midnight shift at a gas station and I have for quite awhile at various stations in different areas with varying levels of criminal activity.

I have regulars, of course. I’m a small-statured woman (as is my partner the other half of the week, and we’ve always been partners) so these regulars often worry about us and keep watch on creepy occurrences when they can.

I had one man who worked in the metro an hour away who would stop in every morning for his cigarettes. He never smiled or seemed friendly, and as I often do, I tried to think of what I could do that might make him smile one day.

It took many months but I finally pulled it off by having his cigarettes ready on the counter and already scanned for him to pay for as he walked in. He smiled, and then asked me

“Do you ever get scared on the night shift? You small girl, is not safe.”

I said I sometimes did but we could lock the doors and hide if we had to, and that the provincial police (think state troopers, if you’re American) had a station close by and came in often to get their highway vehicles washed. I had a good rapport with those police. He nodded and then told me a story about when he first moved to our country from Eastern Europe with his wife and child back in the late 80’s, early 90’s.

He fell asleep at work one night at the gas station he worked midnights at. When he woke up, the phone had been ringing for hours and his manager was shaking him violently asking if he was alright. He was fine, he said, what was the problem? He was sorry he fell asleep.

His manager screamed that it was fine he fell asleep, to look outside. All of their motor oil was missing and the outside of the place was a mess.

The thieves had come and swiped all the oil and left him be because he slept through the entire thing, and then moved down the road to the next station for an encore. At that station, the clerk was awake and fought back, so the thieves stabbed him to death and left him to bleed out.

When he finished telling me this, he concluded with

“If you ever feel sleepy just lock the door and do it, it might save your life”

I don’t work at that station anymore but I think about that guy all the time and wonder how his grandkids are.

Here is a link to an article talking about how that poor other clerk’s killers were finally found 25 years later:

"The other night, my wife took our child out for several hours. In that time I wrapped up work, then left to get dinner around 4:30pm. Got home around 6:30, played with our dog and did a few chores,. Then, when my wife got home about 7:30, we relaxed a bit and I headed for bed about 9:00pm (usually up early with our kid).  

Maybe two minutes after crawling into bed I get a text from my wife with a picture of our dry-erase menu board on our fridge. See, usually at the start of the week, my wife will fill out a rough menu for dinners that week. I remembered seeing it earlier in the day and it was filled out as expected.

The picture she sent was of the menu all scrambled up, like the letters were all moved everywhere, with random words and squiggles throughout. Some of it was her writing, but others were incomplete words, or rewritten words in handwriting that wasn't hers or mine.

This freaked us out, as our one year old certainly didn't do it. The county Sheriff showed up and swept the house and found nothing. Nothing was out of place or missing either. He was spooked by it a bit too. He said they never get a call out in the country where we are and recommended we change our locks (we hadn't as the couple we bought our home from were elderly). So, we did that night.

Edit:

See the two photos. The one is an example of her writing. The other is the actual scrambled menu with her question she wrote on the bottom and texted to me.

"When I was 17 I was hanging out with 2 friends and they wanted to go smoke weed in the woods. I didn't feel like it so I drove them and waited in the car.

After a while I was getting bored and decided to go meet them but there were 4 paths going off in different directions so I just took the biggest one. After walking for a few minutes in the pitch black forest (before flashlights on phones), I come across this dip in the trail and on the other side is a bench lightly visible due to the moonlight.

On the the bench is sitting a man and another one in standing in front of him but I can only make out silouhettes. Being sure these are my friends I yell out to them before walking over. If you ever walked the woods at night it's just an uneasy feeling all around so I was cautious to begin with.

Well it turns out, juste after yelling out to my ""friends"", both silouhettes turn around towards me. Not a word, not a sound, the guy sitting down starts sprinting FULL FUCKING SPEED towards me in complete silence. I got the absolute fuck out of there sprinting also the other way and tripping over shit because I couldn't see anything. 

I finally get out and lock myself in my car, but I was really worried for my friends. Maybe a minute later I see them both coming out of a completely different path, they also confirmed they never saw me or anyone else. My heart still sinks just thinking about that dude sprinting in silence wtf was that shit",1
"My aunt fell asleep on her couch one night and my uncle was asleep upstairs. She woke up around 12am to a random man staring at her while she slept. He said “the guy upstairs was sound asleep.” Meaning he came in, saw my aunt on the couch, looked around, saw my uncle asleep upstairs, and then sat there and watched. She told him to leave and somehow by the will of god HE LEFT. He slid in through the back door……. We live in a relatively safe area! Craziest shit I have ever heard",1
"So when I was around 18 I went to town to drink something with my friends. We went all in and by 2 am I was completely wasted. Couldn't see, walk or think straight.
One of my mates remained sober to drive us back home. We went to the parking lot and I could hear a voice whimmering somewhere in the dark. I turned around and saw 2 guys carrying a girl to a car. I got closer and now I could hear her voice. She obviously was drunk but she repeated ,,no,, and ,,I don't want,, over and over. Adrenaline kicked in and I became sober instantly. I screamed at them and immediately called the police. I wasn't fast enough so they could get in the car and drive off. But I saw the license plate, gave it to the woman I talked to at the police station and they informed me about 10 minutes later that they arrested the two guys. The whole scene was so terrifying.

"This only happened earlier this year; a work colleague was off work for a long time, not like him at all. When he eventually returned we found out that his friend had been murdered by a group of football(soccer) wankers.

They'd been in a pub watching a match for the team they supported; they were celebrating a win when a group of men from the opposing team got angry and started arguing. When my colleague and his friends left the pub, they jumped his friend and beat him so bad he ended up in hospital where he eventually succumbed to the injuries.


This is one of the reasons I hate football, especially where I am (England). Riot vans, hundreds of police etc always around every train station and football stadium. Sad little men willing to take a life over a bag of air getting kicked around. It's not the first time, certainly won't be the last, someone has died over fucking football.",1

"This story kind of creeps me out even to this day but I have a pretty good one

I lived in mesa Arizona when I was 10 years old, we lived in a rough area but I was just a kid completely ignorant to the dangers of the world. I was walking back home from my friends house and my mother wanted me home by 9 and id always start walking back at around 8:40 to make sure I wasn't late, and its only like a couple blocks from my house so it wasn't a super long distance. it was around the time of year when the sun would set at 5:30 and be dark well before 7pm. so it was very much night time.

As I'm walking I hear a woman calling my name, I turned to look and see it was one of my moms friends, but she didn't know her too well. however I just saw that she was familiar and wont say a name, but I turned around and said hello and smiled. she walked up to me and told me my mom had called her and asked her to come get me and ride me back because something happened at my house, she said it was an emergency and that I needed to go with her and her husband whom my family was also familiar with.

I was only about 5 minutes from my house but I was told it was an emergency and I agreed to go with her. As I'm walking I get this weird feeling in my gut and this shaking in my legs that I now today realize was my instincts being on HIGH alert. I stopped for a minute and asked if we could call my mom and she said my mother was in the hospital right now and that I need to hurry. right as we were opening the door to the car i hear my mother SHOUT my name as loud as she can. and i turned on a dime and quickly walked towards my mom.

My mom asked what's going on and the woman replies and says that she was just giving me a ride home because she saw me. Was not the story she gave me so I told my mother what she told me and asked what was going on. My mom just looked at me and she could always tell when I'm lying vs when I'm telling the truth. The woman then goes to interrupt me likely to lie and my mom cuts her off and just stared back at her with the most shocked look ever and these words still send shivers down my spine. she says in the most shocked voice ever. ""you were trying to take my son"" and the husband looks out the window hurrying his wife in the car and as I looked back at towards him, I can see a syringe on the dashboard leaning against the windshield that he grabs right as I see it.

she gets in the car because at that point my mom was ready to kill her, and reached into her purse because she keeps a pocket knife. but they drove away and right after they did my mom looked at me and just burst into tears saying ""I'm almost lost you"" my mom knew full well what was happening and I was still too shaken to even say anything and just hugged her back and we went home. I was still in denial and to cope, I would convince myself that maybe i wasn't in any danger.

My family ofc never kept in contact with any of them but my step dad at the time submitted a tip to the police of the incident. when they caught up with him about 3 months later we had found out that he was arrested for having CP on his computer and found restraints in his closet as well as some containers of Propofol. They found pictures of me from my moms Facebook downloaded on his computer as well, leading them to believe that I was actually being watched for a good bit.

I never liked talking about it because to this day, if I hadn't stopped for those 10 seconds to ask the woman to call my mom, I don't know where id be or if id even be alive right now making this comment. and while it may seem like something that would have easily been forgotten, it was never the case for me. I haven't even told my closest friends this story but I might sometime soon. I asked my mom what happened that night, why she came looking for me. she described the same feeling I remembered feeling moments before I was almost abducted. just a lot sooner than I did. and just had the instinct that I was in danger.

I'm not usually a lucky person, it seems the odds are always against me but I always remember how lucky I was that night, that my mom decided to listen to her instincts when I didn't. I've never ignored my instincts since and every night after that when I finally did decide to leave my house. my mom would walk with me all the way up until I turned 13 to come back to live with my dad. And that to date is the scariest thing I think I've ever experienced. its some shit you only hear of on the news and nobody ever assumed it will happen to them but my life was a mere 20 seconds from being completely different.",1

She was nice. To anyone who was nice to her cats anyways. She’d sit outside in spring and summer and nice autumn days. So when winter rolls around and she’s nowhere to be seen, people think nothing of it. 

Then spring comes. People realise she’s not out and after a week concerns arise. A wellness check is found and the cops get into the house. 

They say the place stank of cat piss and crap and there was a lingering smell of decay. They walk around noting trash not taken out and stinking, cat carriers with tags on in a spare room. And then her room. They open the door and find her on her floor being eaten by the cats. She was long dead and decaying by then",1

Anyway it was enough to make him put out the fire and go sleep in his car with the doors locked. So he falls asleep and in the middle of the night hears a big noise that wakes him up. He wasn’t sure what it was because he had been sleeping and doesn’t hear anything else (maybe he dreamt it?) but it’s still pitch black out so he stays in the car and goes back to sleep. The next morning he wakes up and the first thing he sees is a big handprint on his passenger side window, like someone had smacked the glass. His friends swear it wasn’t them and I believe them, they’re not the type to prank each other like that. Still freaks me out and I think about it sometimes when I camp now",1
"Was out in California with my wife and daughter (she was about 10 months old at the time) visiting my father-in-law. We drove into the city to hang out, he had to handle a traffic ticket so we drove to the courthouse. As we drive in, this car is driving into the lot (there was a gate with a guard), not driving super fast, but too fast for a parking lot. The attendant seemed to be running after the car…we were super confused. Car proceeds to drive into the lot, pick up even more speed, then the passenger, a woman, opens the door and falls out of the car. We stop our car, we’re not in the lot yet, and are all wondering wtf is going on. The car stops, driver hops out and starts chasing the woman. Then all hell breaks loose. She’s screaming, he’s chasing her, lot attendant is close behind him, and then I notice: the driver chasing her has a knife. Woman passenger runs towards the courthouse, up the steps, and the driver chasing her catches up. Courthouse police are running toward them now, three of them, guns drawn yelling at them to stop. The driver tackles the woman—remember, he has a knife—and as they tussle on the ground we hear 4-5 gunshots. I could have sworn they just killed both of them, but the woman jumps up and is quickly ushered into the courthouse by one of the cops. The other two approach the man, guns still drawn, and he writhes around a bit then goes still. My wife didn’t think they were real gunshots, she thought they were beanbags or something. Thankfully my daughter was in a rear-facing car seat and had no idea what was going on. We turned around and left. News later reported the woman was being physically abused by the man, but she convinced him to take her to the courthouse to deal with a speeding ticket or something. She took her chance to get away, he chased her with the knife, and the courthouse cops shot and killed him. I was crazy impressed that they fired into this tangle of two people and the woman wasn’t injured. Still doesn’t feel totally real that I watched those cops shoot and kill that guy.",1
"Not quite as scary as other comments but this happened to me a while back:

A few years ago I came home to find the front door of my house was ajar. My housemate at the time had such a bad habit of not locking up so I just thought it was a new level of this and got annoyed. 

Some background of relevance to the story, the front door opened right into the living room and the house itself was tiny. Downstairs was just the living room and kitchen, which was a small space directly off the living room and it was to the right of the front door. Opposite the front door in the living room were French doors, which opened into the back garden. Upstairs there were just two rooms and a bathroom. 

So after finding the door ajar, I went in but nothing looked out and of place: Housemate’s MacBook was on the couch, there were car keys on the window ledge by the front door, and there was some cash and an ATM card on the coffee table. I didn’t suspect anything because the valuables were there, so I didn’t think much of it. Still, because the door had been open for god knows how long I went upstairs to check the rooms to see if the neighbour’s cat had come in (he loved coming over to go asleep). While I was upstairs I heard someone running across the living room and violently throwing the French doors open. Stupidly, I ran down to check what was happening (still not thinking anything was happening). I got down in time to see a guy in the garden jumping over the back fence, which was quite high. I locked the doors, calmed myself down, and laughed off the near miss of interrupting a home intruder. 

I went into the kitchen to make some tea. All the cupboards and drawers were open, he had rummaged through everything, and all the sharp knives, including an entire knife set and wooden block were gone. Took me a few minutes to realise that this guy, the guy that had just helped himself to all the sharp knives, had been waiting in the kitchen the entire time I was downstairs. The kitchen was only about 10 feet from the door and he would have had to run past me to get to the French doors or front door to get out. Was scary to think that if I hadn’t gone upstairs to check for the cat that I’d probably have come face to face with him in the very very small kitchen.


TLDR: some guy broke into my house, I came home while he was still in the kitchen but didn’t know he was there. He ran off while I was upstairs. Later discovered he’d stolen all of our sharp knives.",1
"On 30 July 2008, Tim McLean, a 22-year-old Canadian man, was stabbed, beheaded, and cannibalized while riding a Greyhound Canada bus along the Trans-Canada Highway.

He was sleeping in his seat with headphones on, when Vincent Weiguang Li produced a knife and began stabbing him.  The bus driver and passengers fled the bus, leaving Li with McLean's body.  

When police apprehended him  Parts of the McLean's body were retrieved from the bus, while his ear, nose and tongue were found in Li's pockets. The victim's eyes and a part of his heart were never recovered and in spite of his vehement denial, are presumed to have been eaten by Li.

Li was found mentally incompetent to stand trial and was placed into  a mental health center's custody.  On February 10, 2017 Li was discharged unconditionally and has no further supervision.

Li is possibly on a bus somewhere right now.

"I worked as a house cleaner in Minneapolis for most of 2019. One of my clients was a mom with two kids. They lived in an old house that they kept pretty tidy, but I always got a sad, run-down feeling when I did my cleans. I think it was it mostly due to being an old, creaky house that I'm sure many people had lived in over the years, but it also had the look of being hastily furnished with mismatched, second-hand goods. 

The mom was very mild-mannered and soft-spoken. She had a quiet confidence about her and just seemed like a gentle soul. Most of the times I cleaned she was in her room on work calls, but occasionally I was left in the house alone. Her boys had Pokemon bed sheets and so many books strewn about their room. I didn't interact with the boys much but they seemed like goofy, normal kids with a caring, hard-working mom. 

During one clean I was tidying up their living room, which had a desk in it. The desk was covered in papers, and I decided to stack them so I could dust off the table. The papers on top of the pile were from the woman's lawyer detailing finalized divorce proceedings. I did not read much further, but did learn that she was now separated from her husband.  

I left the cleaning company that fall and moved on to other work, eventually leaving Minneapolis in fall of 2020 to move in with my parents in Virginia.

That December, I got an email from massage therapist I regularly saw back in Minneapolis whose mailing list I'd forgotten to unsubscribe from. She said she was taking time off work as the boyfriend of her child had been shot and murdered. She included a link to a database for people who had been the victims of gun violence in the Twin Cities. My morbid curiosity got the best of me, and I started scrolling through and reading about the people listed.

About twenty minutes in, after clicking to the next page, I was startled to see pictures of the woman I used to clean for, as well as pictures of her two children. 

I googled her name and learned that in early December of 2019, her ex-husband had come to her house to pick up the boys, as usual, but this time he brought a gun. The kids ran out to meet him, excited for their time together, and then realized he was armed and tried to run away. He shot both boys in the front yard, multiple times, in the middle of the day, in front of neighbors. 

He then went inside and shot and stabbed their mom, before shooting and killing himself. 

He allegedly left a note, but it has not been publicly released.

I cannot claim to have really known this woman and her kids, but it is a strange feeling to be intimately familiar with a family's home and belongings, and to then learn they all had been murdered at said home by someone so closely linked to them. Suffice it to say that I've spent a lot of time since learning about their murder reading about family annihilation and trying to understand how people can get to the point where they feel that that is the right and necessary thing to do.

I wish her family as much peace as is possible to feel after something so incomprehensible and violent.",1

I opened this thread hoping to see horrifying spooky ghost stories… All I see is how horrible people are.,1
"One night, a husband and wife were in their first floor condo sound asleep in their bedroom. The wife heard a noise that was loud enough to wake her up. She thought at first they it was “just one of those noises” and was probably nothing. Nevertheless, she lay very still and listened carefully to see if it was anything. Sure enough, she heard someone going through their condo. She shook her husband awake and immediately put her fingers to her lips when he woke up.  She whispered to him that someone was in the condo. Husband crawls out of bed and goes out to the living room and shouts “I know you are in here so just get the fuck out.” The intruder doesn’t leave, but instead comes at the husband and begins to fight him. Husband is very strong. He has a physical job and has very powerful hands. Still, the intruder goes round and round with the husband and won’t stop. Husband continues to try to convince the intruder to leave. He won’t. Wife is still in the bedroom with 911 on the line at this point. Husband finally gets intruder in a choke hold. Feels the breath going out of the guy. Knows that if he continues he will strangle the intruder. Husband doesn’t want to kill anyone so he starts to ease up on his neck. Once the intruder feels his breath coming back, he reaches into his boot, pulls out his knife and stabs husband in his chest. Intruder runs into the bedroom where the wife is, grabs her purse and takes off.  Husband comes back into the bedroom and is completely grey with blood squirting out of is hands as he clutches his chest. 911 gets there shortly after and rushes husband to the hospital where emergency surgery takes place right away. Turns out the intruder hit husband’s lung and he almost died.  Kill or be killed? 

This happened to me and my husband",1
"The one that keeps coming to mind is the dad who poisoned his own kid on Halloween by putting cyanide in his pixie sticks, and made sure to distribute a few more poisoned pixie sticks to other kids - including his own daughter - to keep investigators off his tail (hoping that the home that gave out the pixie sticks would be interrogated instead of him). He coerced his son to eat the pixie stick before bed and didn’t get him any help. His son did die. None of the other kids ate the pixie sticks. He did it because he needed life insurance money to pay off debts.

When the dad was eventually executed, people stood outside his prison throwing Halloween candy while yelling “trick or treat”.

It came back to mind for me this year when my kids got pixie sticks from our local church during a Halloween event. I couldn’t bring myself to let them have them.",1
"I grew up in the Philippines with my aunt and uncle (now in the US with my mom) Who both came from families that grew up in very rural areas. Now in the Philippines, there are tons of common urban legends and myths of monsters and ghosts and spirits but that’s what those are. Legends. Never did I expect my aunt and uncle (and family in general, mother and other aunts included) to have such a vivid paranormal experience that caused them to move their home/s.

For context, my aunts, uncle, and mom involved in this story are the most pragmatic, business-oriented, no bullshit, hard-ass, straighttothepoint, people I know. Super religious too. They’re quick to call out bullshit. They’d reprimand us heavily if we got caught lying. People with extremely professional backgrounds and educations. 

But one time my older cousin brought up the conversation of witchcraft(very common in the Philippines apparently. And how he doesn’t believe in that bullshit (much like his parents, or so I thought). My uncle shot back, “You should always be careful of accepting food or gifts from strangers or even acquaintances especially if you don’t know their background…” again, an expected statement from him, “… it could be gayuma (love potion) or some type of curse”

This doubled down on my cousin’s tirade and started calling out his parents for believing such farce. 

Unable to defend their point, my uncle and aunt gave up and decided to tell everybody in the dinner table the story of why they left the city and moved to a slightly more rural area.

Before I was born, they lived in an apartment within the city but they were forced to move after my cousin (the one tirading) and I was born. Apparently our births started attracting unwanted attention.

There’s a few bits of lore here you need to know:
1. Aswang = a type of monster that feasts on flesh. Can assimilate into normal society during the day. Can be your teacher, classmate, crush, neighbor etc. Can grow wings and fly. Is associated with bats and bat-like sounds.
2. Tik-tik = a type of flesh eating monster that specifically feeds on pregnant women’s babies, and young children. They climb the rooftops of houses and make a high-pitched/deep “ticking” sound as they walk on the roof. Hence the name: Tik-tik. The louder the sound, the farther they are. The softer, the closer. Silent: right there. 
3. For some reason, monsters in general like consuming babies, lore-wise. Also the tik-tik may or may not be a type of aswang im not sure. They’re human, though. Well humanoid with a very long sharp tongue that can pierce through roofs and bellies.



So my cousin gets conceived and apparently he gets absolutely haunted. Lots of extremely unexplainable things start happening in the physical realm. They didn’t get into the small details but I remember some key details.

They would buy garlic to hang on windows to deter the monsters. 

Sounds, ticking, squeaking from the rooftops, bat-like noises (but loud) could be heard late at night and they “followed”. And every time these things happened, my cousin would cry his heart out and never stop until morning. 

He would be a normal baby during the day. But the night he would just cry in terror out of nowhere.

Three kids who lived next door that my aunt could still name today, would camp out at my aunt and uncles balcony some nights with slingshots and stones, shooting at the trees that surrounded the house to “help protect” the baby who they got really attached to. 

My other aunt who was a college student living with them or helping babysit would have her own experiences when left alone with the baby. 

Electrical issues? There were multiple instances where the entire apartment building would be okay, and everyone had power except my family’s room late at night? They had it looked at multiple times but there was no possible explanation (uncle’s an electrical engineer) it was so odd it got the attention of their landlord and neighbors (that’s how the 3 kids knew about the haunting)

To combat this they did tons of spiritual related practices, one of them being playing religious music over the cassette tape player as loud as they can when night came. 

Except one night, which my aunt recalled as the scariest experience so far. They were playing the cassette tape. It was near midnight. My cousin was fast asleep near his mom who was up late doing something else while my aunt was studying (she was in college). All of a sudden the religious music player stopped playing. Dead in its tracks. Like the machine just froze. Then they heard a quiet but absolutely there sound from outside the window, “eek-eek” 

And boom… my cousin let out the shrillest, nerve-wracking, bone-chilling, wail my aunt has ever heard. From fast asleep to sudden cries of death in a split second. And this went on for hours. And both my super hard-ass and pragmatic no-nonsense aunts were scared shitless.The music player was fine the next day.

But my cousin would still continue his crying and the haunting would persist here and there.

I guess it was tolerable until I got born 2 years later. Then it got so bad they decided to just move. 

They told this story out of straight up concern and warning. They almost didn’t even want to tell it. We were 17/19 when they told us so it took them a long time to get to it. 

My cousin wouldn’t budge and claimed “yokai” just basic scientific explanation for stuff they couldn’t comprehend so they cried monster: yokai.

I… can’t help but believe it. Simply because throughout my years here in America with my mom. She would drop paranormal experiences and references out of nowhere as serious as she would discuss the stock market and why I should invest my money. 

She’s had experiences during pregnancy and as a child. She would say things like, we gotta do a background check of whoever you date just to make sure they aren’t witches. This? Coming from the same woman who lived a military lifestyle and is all about believing only the information you see in front of you? 

If my family were a bunch of nut jobs with no education or credibility to their name, I wouldn’t care. But they’re all intelligent, westernized, well educated professionals who dug themselves out of poverty from sheer hard work and ingenuity. They’re ruthless-minded. They’re so no-nonsense it hurt. And yet there they are spouting stories of monsters and spirits and how we should be careful towards the paranormal; with the same serious warning face they’d give me when they talk about drugs and cigarettes and avoiding them.

So yeah how can I not believe them. So imma be careful. And you should too.

Edit: grammar stuff",1
"I have twice in my life encountered something I cannot identify, that has been identified to me as a Wendigo.

I was out backcountry camping. Not terribly far out but far enough off the beaten track that I know there were no people within 5km. For the record, no drugs or alcohol, not overly tired, and if I had only been once in my life I would write it off as a dream or misremembered memory.

Got a little thirsty, late at night. Cleared out my water bottle, figured I would walk down to the river nearby, fill my bottle so the chlorine tablets could do their job overnight and I'd have water in the morning. Maybe a 5 minute hike from my camp. There, by the water, lit only by the moon, is an animal. My flashlight is pointed at my feet so I don't trip. It's got 4 legs, and appears dark/black. I'm going through the list in my head. Too thin for a black bear. Can't think of anything else that'd be that dark. And then it stood up. I can only describe it, as a muscular coyote, with no fur, black skin, loooong arms, and judging by the trees it was standing near, about 7 feet tall. It looked at me. I looked at it. That was not a coyote. It was not a bear. I don't know what it was, but I sure as hell wasn't gonna find out in the middle of the night. I kept facing it, backed away slowly until I was out of line of sight, got back to my camp, packed up my shit, and left.

Some years later, and about a thousand kilometers away, I had a second encounter. Late at night, I'm walking down a dirt service road near a farm. Head pops up out of the wheat and looks at me. I recognize that shape. It wasn't looking at me. I shouted ""Hey, don't mind me, I'm just going that way"". It looked at me. The head disappeared into the wheat. Noped the fuck outta there.

I don't know what I saw. It doesn't match anything I've ever seen. I've since had the chance to speak to some people about it. Answer I get is a wolf or coyote with mange. No way. Ears were wrong, and those arms were too long, aside from the way it stood.

I don't claim it was supernatural or some undiscovered cryptid. But I don't go walking in the moonlight in the backcountry of the rockies anymore.",1

"My parents went to the same high school in the late 80s/early 90s. A guy a year or two younger than my mom was suspended and as a result, being kicked out of his house. He broke into a local sheriff’s house to steal a gun, showed up to the high school to say bye to his girlfriend before heading out on the road to who knows where. The assistant principal approached him in the cafeteria during lunch and told him to leave immediately. He turned around and fired a round directly into the AP’s head. My dad was skipping school that day, but my mom and aunt were there when it happened. The whole cafeteria froze for a second, then the kid started firing at students and all hell broke loose. In the end he injured three students and surrendered quietly when the police arrived. My mom acts like the shooting never happened and my aunt doesn’t like to talk about it.",1

"Weird....I have a similar story!

Years ago I remember sneaking out of my friends house at night to really do nothing but walk around the neighborhood and hide from car headlights. We were young and bored. There was a ""homeless"" camp that was down in some woods off the railroad tracks not too far from his house. We had seen the trail and knew what was back there.

One of the homeless guys that lived there was actually an old friend of my buddies Dad, and he had stopped over a few times and my friends Dad let him shower there and everything. He could have worked if he wanted, but legit told us he just liked living ""off the grid"". Just wanted to give you some backstory on the reason why we thought it would be cool and ""safe"" to go check it out at night.

We were a bit nervous at first thinking what if we get there and his Dads friend isn't there...so we were sneaking up on it. It was a longer walk than we thought. We got kind of close and saw there was a fire going lighting up the woods a bit.

 We start sneaking closer but the trail seemed to continue straight, while the camp set off the trail to the left. We got idk maybe 100 feet from the camp (about 30 meters) and we looked down the trail and saw a faint silhouette of what we thought was a person. The silhouette looked like it was coming from deeper in the woods towards the camp. We froze and ducked slightly to the side of the trail. 

I told my friend that I didn't like it, and we should just sneak the hell out. He said he had the same feeling. As I said, the fire at the camp was just enough to light the area well enough to see. We end up slowly creeping slightly off the trail back to the railroad tracks. We get probably 30-40 or so feet (9-12 meters) and I told him I would rather just hit the trail and just slowly walk back because the bushes and trees and everything were hard to navigate and I would rather be able to see something coming so we could book it out. We played football and were both pretty fast.

We slide out of the brush and see the silhouette has gotten closer, however moving further from the fire, the light was dimmer, but we could still make out someone or something was standing there moving closer. My first thought was that maybe they saw us duck into the bushes and were coming to check, but it just felt off. My friend and I looked at each other and both mutually and silently decided to pick up the pace. Almost on que, we both looked back and the silhouette was now BOOKING IT TOWARDS US ABSOULTELY SILENT. No noise, just fast movement. We high tail it as fast as we can.

Thankfully, the trail was wide so we weren't bumping into each other or anything. Neither of us looked back until we hit the railroad tracks, then hit the railroad track bridge and were on the other side. I looked back as I was slowing down, past the bridge and didn't see anyone. We got back to his house pretty fast and luckily that was the end of it.",1

But as soon as she left this old couple rolls up to the driveway and asks me and the 4 year old for directions. I tried to tell her the street was a few streets over but she said she couldn’t hear me over the car so could we come closer. I wasn’t sure what to do because I already knew about stranger danger but didn’t want to be rude to elders. Luckily right then the neighbor mom came sprinting out and talked to them. I overheard the lady say I was helpful telling them they were on the wrong street, and the neighbor told her the same thing I did. It was only when I was older thinking back on it I realized it was weird they asked such small children for directions and that she had heard what I said but lied trying to get me to come closer.

"I lived in New Orleans up until recently and I 2021-2022, there was a huge uptick of carjackings. Car theft and breakins were always happening, but I had never heard about as many jackings as I did in that time. And it was happening all over the city, when people were getting in their cars, stopped at lights, or even filling up gas. 

One poor lady was carjacked as she was putting her groceries in the car and her arm got stuck (either sleeve in the car door, or arm tangled in the seatbelt, I don’t remember) but she was dragged along until her arm ripped off and she bled out pretty quickly. It was pretty terrible, and I do think the carjackings petered out a little bit after that, but still terrifying to be in a car in New Orleans for the last two years I lived there. 

I worked deep in the city at point, and my route took me down a long crowded street, that had plenty of cover for hiding (alleyways, lots of parked cars on the street, etc) and lots of stops.

It drives me absolutely batshit enraged that recreational drugs like marijuana, MDMA and low-dose opiates are illegal, and alcohol isn’t. 

I used to be a paramedic, and I never, ever had a safety issue from patients under the influence of these recreational drugs. Hell most heroin users apologised to me for taking too much or not testing the strength from a different dealer. 

But drunk people? Man I needed the cops involved all the time, I needed to sedate them, dealing with them post sedation is a pain in the ass because alcohol + sedating drugs is a bad combo for blood pressure, respiratory drive, airway protection etc.

"My state legalized weed a few years ago, which is great. It's new england (yes I'm in Mass), so tons of handwringing and NIMBY shit. I'm honestly appalled how readily (and cheaply) I can go get a lethal volume of vodka - go to store, grab a couple handles, pay, MAYBE show ID, leave. But if I want to go buy a couple grams of demon Marijuana I have to go to a highly secure facility, show my ID just to get in, again once inside, and AGAIN when I go to pay. I've ""overdosed"" on weed before when I didnt understand how much I was eating (the wrapper said 350mg, I just didnt think it was all that much) and while some of the effects were uncomfortable (a bit nauseous, some shaking when I tried to walk to the bathroom), it was nothing like having 4 or 5 shots of high test booze in quick order. I could still see and talk and more or less move around, I knew where and when I was, and while I was sleepy the next day I was no worse for wear. 

And it's not necessarily that I think the retail weed process needs to be easier (though I would not comomplain, but it's really not bad considering I'm legally buying pot at a potshop), it's that. I've become alarmed, over time, just how blasé we are about alcohol. It's literal poison. One strong beer makes me feel dumb and fuzzy, and it only goes downhill from there.",1

Benadryl was my teen son's drug of choice for awhile. Cheap and easy to get. (Not hard to shoplift a big bottle of you're a broke kid) That shit can put you straight into a scary psychosis - I've seen it.,1
"For a while I was using Benadryl to basically self-medicate for insomnia. Only 1 or 2. One time I took four and I don’t remember why, I think maybe I forgot I had already taken some or the drowsiness didn’t seem to be kicking in so I took more, but man I felt weird from that. I didn’t trip but I remember feeling like everything was slow motion, or like I was moving through molasses. I felt kind of panicked but I couldn’t move fast enough to do anything about it. Didn’t like the feeling and have been very careful with Benadryl since then. 

Not being able to sleep, even when you’re dead tired, just plain sucks",1
"After not sleeping for about four days during the worst of my insomnia I wound up in the ER after taking 10 Benadryl (250mg total) and (unsurprisingly) not getting any sleep. At this point in my life I weighed maybe 90lbs because that’s what not sleeping and not eating and working all the time will apparently do to you. I have vague memories of the worst drymouth imaginable, like my throat was sticking to itself, and my heart pounding at like 150bpm while laying in bed.

They kept asking me if I had been trying to harm myself and in my delirium (96 sleepless hours is well past when you start to hallucinate) it was hard to get across that I was simply beyond exhausted and desperate to rest.

I now have (mild) anxiety attacks whenever I have to take Benadryl for allergies.

Anyway, I cannot fucking fathom 1000mg of that drug holy shit",1

Both experiences were absolute torture, and I experienced rebound anxiety, insomnia, cravings etc for months.",1
"Yep I was taking 5-8mg daily xanax for more than 3 years and tapered down to .5mg ativan daily because I was drinking and taking wayyy too much of them.

I remember my freshman year of high school in ‘09 it was the cool thing for kids to pop like 14 Benadryl at once.  One kid said he saw ghosts on the white board in like 2nd period and projectile vomited all over the front of the classroom and was just sitting there saying random words and his mom had to come pick him up.  Another closer friend of mine ate around that many in a Friday night and for whatever reason put on this trench coat and a ski mask and started walking around our small town at nighttime and would like jump in the bushes or lay flat in a ditch on the side of the road if he saw any headlights in the distance.  I remember the next day him saying he could barely walk because his kidneys hurt so bad.,1
"I agree. My doc decided I needed to switch to Tramadol in place of Norco. I took one dose, and that was the last I remembered until the next morning. Woke up and found a release slip from the ER on my coffee table. I called the ER to inquire and the gal told me I’d come in stating I was having a bad reaction to a med. she said two hours later I told her I was fine and checked myself out.  Asked her how I got to the ER. She told me I drove. I live 20 miles from the hospital, mostly interstate roads to get there. So, apparently I drove there and back. I have no memories of any of it.",1
"As an idiot teenager, I thought taking a shit ton of Prozac would get me high or some stupid shit.  Never took it again after that.  Funny, my school put me in an outpatient rehab center for failing a drug test for weed.  Then preceded to load me up on Prozac, Vyvanse, and then Xanax.  I stopped taking them and started smoking weed again. I felt like a zombie.  Told the outpatient center to fuck off.  The xans and amphetamines took years to kick though, as I was abusing them.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal can also kill you,1
"I was on Effexor for several years because SNRIs are the only antidepressants that touch my depression without making it worse (SSRIs trigger severe suicidal ideation). I am now on a different one, but it’s basically just Effexor that skips a level of metabolism.  The withdrawal (or fear of it) is what actually makes people far more compliant with their medication than ones with a longer half-life.  Not a first choice drug to prescribe by any means, but I can count on one hand the times I’ve missed a dose in over 10 years with those meds and can assure you, withdrawal is hell.  Brain zaps are fucking brutal, and when paired with the headaches?  It’s a real bad time, man.",1
I remember when i stopped taking this. I was running around the track at the gym and blacking out for a few seconds every 10 steps or so. Nasty stuff,1

"All the comments say Tylenol, but as a doctor Tylenol is easily the safest pain med you can take if you take the appropriate amount. It’s only liver toxic when you take too much. I would say NSAIDS (ibuprofen, naproxen) are a lot more dangerous because they can have serious side effects even in “safe doses”",1
Ibuprofen is hard on the stomach and can cause ulcers,1
"I just got through the brain zaps stopping citalopram.  I thought I had tapered alright, but guess not since those happened weeks later.

  
It had given me these awful tremors.  This was a bit of a mystery until I decided to google the combination.  Then it was “holy shit.  This explains everything!?”  It really helped screw up my liver too.

However, the worst medication I was ever on was Topamax.  Fuck topamax.",1
"Haha I had the same response to Prednisone.  I was on 90 mgs/day last year for about 6 weeks.  I would get out of bed at 6am and clean and stretch before work.  I didn't give a fuck about anything at work.  I would be focused but all the other bullshit that would give me anxiety or trigger me couldn't touch me.  I would love to keep taking it if it wasn't for the acid reflux that made it feel like my esophagus was melting.

Edit:  I should mention, as great as it was, it's also just categorically bad for your health long-term.",1

Pretty sure I coughed before it hit my lungs and I never full on consumed it. Thank God",1
The fact that many people have seen the same thing while tripping on Benadryl is absolutely insane. It's so weird. Why would so many people's trips manifest with something awful like that? All I had to do was read about it a little to get throughly creeped out.,1
I’m pretty sure I got serotonin syndrome from tramadol combined with my old antidepressant (Effexor).,1
I graduated in 2014 and know soooo many people from high school who were victims of the Xandemic. What’s worse than that is when they all started ordering fake ones through the mail.

"Effexor is even worse. It’s an SNRI with a very short half life, so even one missed dose can fuck you up",1

the issue with ibuprofen is largely that people think it's benign and harmless so they treat it casually-- they just grab a couple every so often for a few days because it still hurts and then next thing you know they've been on 800mg every 2-4 hours for two weeks and of course they have hurt themselves.",1

"Might be cliche but my partner. I had left home in the darkest place I've ever been. Parents were mentally and phsyically abusive. Parents divorced and it ripped my family in half, with some siblings siding with one side and half with the other. I had failed out of state college due to depression. Had failed out of community college after that because I couldn't make myself go. Worked a dead end gas station job for $8 an hour. Walked in on my fiancee of 5 years fucking my best friend like her life depended on it. I left town in February and moved 400 miles away. Decided to spend the next year just partying and blowing all my money on whatever I wanted and then end my own life on Christmas alone in my apartment, so I could go out on my own terms. Then around November, I met a girl named Jennie (name changed) when a work friend and his girlfriend invited me out for burritos for an early Thanksgiving, classy right? Well his girlfriends roommate was curious if she could come too since she'd just gotten back from swim practice and was hungry too. She had the funniest hairstyle I'd ever seen. It was super teased up and put us in something I can only describe as a Cockatoo crest hairstyle. We started talking after that, being fwbs after a short bit. Never intended to get attachted. Well one night about 2 weeks from my, *ahem*, deadline, she asks me if she could stay at my place over Xmas break since her mom gave her brother her old room when he moved back in and they didn't have space. I don't know why I said yes. We had only known each other about a month and I was comitted to this plan for so long. But I did. We watched a movie that night and had some shots. Fell asleep in my bed about 1 am. I wake up about 4 am to her just kinda resting her head on my chest and swirling her fingers on my stomach. I remember what she said after that so vividly. ""I know we both agreed to this, no strings attatched. But... I think I love you. Your so kind and sweet and I look forward to seeing you every time you come stay at the dorm, or I come here. Not just for the sex. I really do think I love you. Its ok if you don't feel the same. I just wanted you to know."" And... she never moved out after that. That was almost 7 years ago, and I'm typing this as she tries to put a taco costume on one of our cats. He's displeased with this. 

   She saved me. Convinced me to go to therapy. We laughed together, cried together. She's my heart and soul. We never spend more than a few hours away from each other. We work together at the same job. She's my light, my love, my reason for living. And she still doesn't know about my plan. I don't know if she ever will. I don't want that burden on her. She knew I was struggling, but not how hard. But unkowingly, she gave me hope and love when I needed it most. And I can't, but I will spend every day of my life, until my last breath, treating her like the angel she is, and there aren't words to describe my love for her.",1

Revenge and my kids,1
"Originally tried thinking the usual; ""its selfish, think of your loved ones, blah blah blah..."" and quickly realized I didn't care. It wasn't their life, they weren't going through it and I'm aloud to be selfish with my life. Because its MINE.

Then my mind started following that trail and I started thinking ""selfish"" thoughts. Things like ""well if you kill yourself you won't get to read this book you were looking forward to. You wont be able to play these games you love or go for walks or listen to music or do any of the things you love or want to try.""

I had heard the phrase "" it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" before but following this train allowed me to realize that, while I do hate what I was going through, I loved other things more than I hated life.

Basically I FELT rather than thought ""you don't want to die, you just want the pain to stop.""

I also comforted myself with the thought that "" should life ever get to back i can just take myself out any time."". Using the thought that suicide was always on the table as a ""shot of courage"" to continue living. Went full pessimistic nihilist for a while which worked at the time but after a decade I realized that, while that mindset helped in those moments becoming reliant on it never allowed me to adress or heal my depression.

Talked to a friend about it and he told me "" well if that old mindset is no longer helping you than why don't you let it go and form a new look on life?"". Started making progress and addressing my mental state and became noticeably more optimistic on life.

Then *WHAM*. Had my first and most severe anxiety attack I. That shower act as my introduction to the condition and hard reset all my progress. (My anxiety revolves around the quality of my physical life and death. Basically that the thought of slowly wasting away from an illness or dying alone sends my body into fight or flight mode.)

Wnt to therapy, explained to my therapist the above mentioned and how I always hated myself as a person and who I was.

Man looked me in the eye and said. "" its never to late to change who you are."" 

Never knew how badly I needed to hear those worlds. Had me crying in our first session. 

Essentially OP, there wasn't any one thing that lead my to still being alive. There are a lot of reasons and factors throughout the years that came and go. Depression rarely comes from one source so why would its solution?

Find things that make you happy and enjoy living. Adress aspects of your life that you have issues with and work on correcting them. You're going to fall and stumble and stop and maybe even rest, but as long as you never give up on yourself you can always make it through.

"I was making plans to carry the act out, but then, this dog at the vet I worked at fell in love with me. 
She came in off the streets, pregnant and afraid. She had the babies overnight. She wouldn't let anyone near her. I'm not sure how long it'd been since anyone wrangled a lead on her and took her out. I carefully slipped the lead on her head and out we went. It was almost instantaneous, she attatched to me. The rescue group that claimed her kept trying to show her to people, but somehow, i'd always walk by the room and she'd race to my side. I also didn't want a dog at the time, obviously, I literally wasn't planning on being alive past the weekend. But the more and more I took care of her at the vet, the more and more I'd postpone these plans. 'Cause I gotta find her a home. I ended up fostering her, my best friend fostered her surviving puppy. Everyone I brought her to though, they'd tell me ""I think she already has a mama ""
So obviously, I failed fostering. Best friend did as well though, ha. 
She kept me going. I stuck it out for her. Every bit of effort was to give her a better life. She's gotten me through the darkest days, and now we live an entirely better life with my spouse and his dog, both in college planning on having kids.

There’s something called the 3 day rule I’ve heard about. If you’re suicidal you’re supposed to put it off for at least 3 days because you have nothing to lose by doing so. Apparently a lot of people end up putting it off even longer and find little ways to improve their lives. A lot of suicides are impulsive,1

I live on the Oregon coast and i think about driving off the cliffs every. Single. Day.

The suicidal ideation has just gotten so out of control for me lately. I don't understand. Things are going really well for me right now. But my intrusive thoughts are insanely overwhelming. It's a nearly constant barrage of, ""just drive off this cliff. Just jump off that bridge. Just burn this building down. Just fucking die just fucking kill me"" 


Why is it impossible just to be content?????  And I can't tell my therapist or she will 51-50 me. Which will just make everything worse.

Me too I think he died when we were in middle school. He disappeared one day and we never saw him again,1

If he didn’t want me living this way he shouldn’t have left. I’m sober now as I am a few weeks every month. That’s probably the only thing saving my life. All I can do is shake and cry. I’m living in a cheap motel with a broken down car and no food. I don’t know anymore. The only way I’ve survived this long is pills and the doctor might cut me off this month so idk if I’m gonna make it. I don’t want to hurt my loved ones so soon after my dad hurt us but this is so painful,1
You’d be surprised how people would react. My mom all but hated my dad which is part of what caused this. She changed a lot after his death. She goes back and forth between sadness and anger but she tells me all the time how empty things are without him,1
"That, and for me, the images of his death. I wasn’t there but it won’t leave my head. I know I was 29 and it’s stupid because I’m an adult but he was my daddy and I don’t feel safe in the world without him. One of his last messages to me when I was having trouble was “come stay with daddy. I always make you feel safe.” I have extreme anxiety all the time. I don’t function",1
That’s exactly the experience I had several times. The hospital I was in in December was a lot better though. The more violent/psychotic people were separated from the rest of us and I actually related to a lot of people and had some fun. It was still scary feeling trapped and having control taken from me though. The friends I made helped,1
I'm a psychiatric nurse and this is exactly what it's like. It's heartbreaking,1
Thank you. I’m having some kind of nervous breakdown today being sober. It’s only going to get worse the longer I’m without something. I’m shaking and crying. I just don’t want to feel anything. It’s 3 years next month. He was everything. If I can’t have him I at least don’t want to have to feel the loss,1

Other commenters have mentioned that it was cocaine in coke but rather coca leaf extract.  I don't know of that can be turned into cocaine once it's in the coca cola or not.  You might end up with people making cocaine out of the coke and maybe it would end up with coke flavor.  That's worse.

"In the andes mountains, people use coca leaves to help them with altitude “problems” they just take some leaves and chew them while going around, they even do coca tea, does that mean they are cocaine addicted? The answer is no, in fact the “bad” parts of the coca leaves are really poor in the leaf, and it takes many leaves to actually make just a gram of cocaine, so we can’t actually say there was cocaine in coca cola, cause the amount of bad particles were so low to make any effect, something like with andes people

I felt like normal. I never abused it, took more than prescribed, or have it to other people. When I saw a new psychiatrist, he refused to continue the prescription talking about how addicting it is. I don’t need to be told that as I’ve seen people who abuse it, but I never did that. Now I’m back on SSRI and I’m having horrible side effects and bad anxiety and panic. I’m at a loss

"Hi guys 
I’ve suffered with chronic anxiety for the last 15 years (28,F) and have had symptoms back to childhood.

I have been put on medication for this, and also antidepressants in hopes levels will rise and take away from the anxious symptoms.

I’ve never found any medication to work. My current medication routine is 100mg sertraline. I was taking lamotrogine two times a day and stopped after 4 months as there was virtually no effect.

For reference my anxiety is very physically debilitating which causes huge amount of embarrassment and shame in day to day life. I withdrew from working etc for four/five years as this caused such a deep pain in me. 
Hands and face shaking, face sweats, lips trembling when talking. 

In the last year I’ve found a job I want to work hard for. I am studying to support this becoming a career. But I am now on work placement etc. my first placement was so hard and my symptoms came ALIVE. Every single day. When this was effecting my assessment performance I rang my doctor and he put me on Xanax for the anxiety. I didn’t expect much as I didn’t know much about it but I knew that it was a serious drug to go on and he advised it would not be long term. 

I can’t express the relief this brought me.
Every single day I went in to work with the internal anxious day to day thoughts. But it was not physically manifesting itself which brought me such relief. I can’t express it. I was able to sign into work in peace, without secretary staring at me wondering why I was shaking.
Able to fill out my day to day engagements without having that external pressure of knowing the people I’m talking to can see me shake or sweat.

I was always feeling shame about this and how the Xanax actually helped because I knew the doc told me it wouldn’t be long term. But I kept on it and it helped so much.
Now I’m off Xanax 13 days, and struggling hugely. Not only do I still have physica symptoms back which are getting my self esteem, but I am also coming off the Xanax (I think). Like my body is so dizzy. 
I only ever took maximum one a day, in two half tablet doses. Defo wasn’t on much at all but it’s mad how j can feel the withdrawal from my body.

Is there ANY kind of alternative medication for this that would help me in the same way? Anything herbal/ any kind of recommendations of alternative therapies etc. I’m open to anything. It’s to tough cause I feel like I saw myself being able to somewhat function and present as a person to the world, and now that is gone so I don’t feel like any progress has been made. 

Would really really appreciate any kind of guidance!",1
"Basically the title, never done it before but the hangxiety has never been this bad",1
What the fuck do I do,1
"Trying to make it quick and not complicated : had a terribly traumatizing bad trip end of july that showed me the world is a simulation, first few weeks wasnt easy but then i felt ""ok""
Now 2 weeks ago i did MDA and relieved that bad trip, it was bad but really not as bad as the first time. Felt really nauseous for like 4 days after that so i was really paranoid and scared about overdozing but then thursday came and i felt better. Now where everything went shit was the friday 6pm when i came back from work, i was in the metro thinking deeply about what happened and then i started having a panic attack for the first time of my life (i thought i was going back into my bad trip so it made me panic and panic and panic).
Around 1am i went to the emergency bc i couldnt deal with this anymore, but i wasnt seen until 8am. They didnt prescribed me anything just gave me some tips to calm my anxiety/paranoia. I have dealt with it as much as i could the past 5 days but tonight for some reason nothing works and i feel the exact same as last week when i went to the ER.

Well ever since that panic attack at 6pm friday 1 week ago ive been having derealization-depersonalization, feeling like this world doesnt actually exist and that everyone around me are just made up robot.
It comes and go non stop during the day. Its like 2 parts of my brain are fighting together : the delusional one and the rational one. One second i think that this is stupid to think this way and the next i think that it may be true because of what i saw during my drug experience.
It truly is horrible and so painful and feels like pure torture.
I have bpd and i thought the sadness i used to feel was the worst thing ever but clearly i haven't experienced pure fear and paranoia that just doesnt stop.
I'm terrified of having fucked myself up forever with this drug. Im so scared of never going back to normal and never being able to think normally without the anxiety and fear. It feels like the creator of this world is doing this to me to punish me for not being a good person.
Please someone help me i really dont know what to do and im in so much agony. I feel like im going crazy and it terrifies me. I cant believe people can take drugs hundreds of time and be just fine but then i try it only a couple times and i ruined my life.",1
"This weekend was special to start with and then it turned ugly, I got an old phone number from someone I knew who sold xanax and my two brothers went to Thanksgiving with my father who hasn't spoke to me in years. I know that was my trigger, I got released from the ER at 6am this morning and I am very disappointed in myself. I just remember being out of my mind, swallowing whatever pills I could find. My parents almost called the cops on me at 4am, but I've been hospitalized in the past and they knew I was in pain and decided not to. I came to realization in the hospital bed, and fell asleep shortly after... I have been recovering all day. My ears are ringing from the Tylenol, I'm shaky, and my ears and head hurt very bad. If there is a God, he was telling the doctors to give me another chance and not send me to the psych ward. I can say I don't want to die and I wish to have a relationship again with my father and I would not be here if it weren't for my mom and stepdad. I love my family so much, thank you God for not taking me yesterday, thank you. ",1
"For context, I (20F)  am moving from the city where I was going to college back home after I was hospitalized. Today was the day my ndad and I went back there to get all of my furniture and my ex boyfriend, whom I still love and care about deeply, came to help. Here’s what happened next:

I had a mental breakdown bc it was just A Lot™️ and my dad almost made me cry today bc he used his stern voice which is just a step down from his yelling voice so I basically reverted back to childhood. Then when O and I were gonna be ~promiscuous~ together after dinner, I had a panic attack, started crying and hyperventilating, and basically relived being assaulted for three hours. Like I wouldn’t let him touch me except to like hold my waist, touch my face, give me kisses, and play with my hair. I told him about being assaulted, I told him I wanted to die, I told him how much it hurts all the time, I told him how they took a piece of me. I told him it was my fault and explained why it was my fault. I asked him why he didn’t hate me after all the things I’d done. I told him I was a bad person. I couldn’t stop apologizing. There are too many things to apologize for. Once I calmed down he left to go to his apartment, I left to drive home to my city, we said goodbye and he said “I don’t think this is the last time we’ll see each other”. Then on the drive back, I almost ran out of gas in the middle of nowhere so I pulled off to an exit to pump gas AND THE PUMPS WERE OFF. So I had to drive about 20 miles, slow as hell to save gas, with my tank nearly empty. Panic attack, hyperventilating, and crying ensued. Like wailing crying. I was so scared. I ended up being okay and getting gas but also cigarettes because honestly I was so shaken that I needed it to calm down. So that’s like 2.5 weeks wasted but that’s okay, I made that choice, and now I’m moving on. And then I get to like within 15 miles of my exit and I start to think about what O said, “this won’t be the last time we see each other.” And my brain went, “what if it is?” What if I never see him again? What if I never hold him again? The world won’t end but I’ll be crushed more than the dinosaurs were. So I again started crying. And then I was thinking wow, I feel so bad that O fell in love with someone so emotionally damaged. Let’s tell him. So I did, I snap chatted it to him, he’ll see it tomorrow. I am a wreck. I didn’t realize how fucked up I am until I wouldn’t let the man I love so fucking much touch me. 

But overall, I was able to feel my feelings and come down without medicine. I would’ve taken it if I had it. O wanted to smoke but I was just crying and shaking so he held me, but I definitely would’ve smoked if he had rolled a joint. I am proud of myself for not only opening up, but also setting boundaries when I needed to. ",1
"I’ve had moments of extreme agitation and anxiety that is really only resolved by 0.25 mg of Xanax. Due to the situation, when it occurs, exercise is not an option (I’m usually at work when it happens). What is an alternative to Xanax that I can take when needed? ",1

"I posted over on the schizophrenia sub about this, but I figured I would widen my chances of responses by mentioning it here too.  

To try to summarize... I've been having issues since I was 6, hospitalized when I was 14 and they mentioned schizophrenia but due to how long they needed to keep me for to make that diagnosis, they couldn't. Or something like that, I wasn't really aware of what all was going on at the time.  I've seen therapists and no one seemed to think it's what I had.  They mentioned dissociation disorder, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar, etc etc.  Some said it was because I'm not disorganized enough. Some said because my visuals are too 'complex' and one said that I cannot be schizophrenic because ""I like my kids and I shower.""  I've been hoovering in this gray area of not knowing where I belonged for sure.

Well today, I saw an actual psychiatrist.  I usually have no reason to involve a doc because I've stayed away from medicine as much as possible.  My anxiety is becoming quite crippling and I'm starting a job next Monday.  The voices and hallucinations, I have my ways of coping... but when that panic sets in because I've drawn attention to myself or embarrassed myself somehow all bets are off and everything gets jumbled. The narrative get's loud, comforter goes frantic, the 2 that I can't understand get loud and it sounds like a different language, angry one talks about how big of a failure I am.

So the psychiatrist today said she definitely thinks that it's schizophrenia.  I told her it's really the anxiety that is causing my downfall, otherwise my other problems are fine. Well, she suggested Xanax for emergencies for when I need to do something that I feel will bring on the anxiety.  I've taken 1 today because a lady accidentally knocked over a room divider on me (separated some seats for flu shots from other seats in the CVS pharmacy section) and everyone's attention shifted on me and I couldn't cope.  Ironically, I was there for the Xanax so I took one immediately.  I felt really tired, then tired turned into a tired high feeling.  Those feelings have subsided, but now I feel nauseous. Does anyone else get this?  Does the tired and high feeling eventually subside?

Tomorrow, I have to go pick up the Rexulti. She's giving me a months worth of samples to save on cost until I get my first check from working.  Does anyone have any experience with this medicine and what were the side effects you had?

"I feel like my brain has turned to mush. I’ve been having a hard time thinking lately and thinking logically about things. Everything feels like it’s all mixed up like my memories and thoughts. I feel tired all the time and just out of energy. I feel like my adhd have gotten worse. I keep procrastinating(not intentionally) I can’t focus on shit for very long unless it’s something I’m interested in. I feel tired all the time, I can’t get my shit together, and just everything physically and mentally feels confusing and mix d up as shit. I don’t know what to do",1
"I’m currently prescribed Klonopin twice a day for during the day anxiety but I’m having trauma related problems at night falling asleep due to a terrifying burglary that happened when I was young and as result at night, I have very difficult time and I keep all the lights on. I have security cameras. But the big problem is is when I try to go to sleep and stay asleep and I’m thinking about asking my doctor to prescribe me Xanax just for at night to help me deal with this. It’s getting worse and worse specially with the longer times at night that we have in the fall/winter. my Dr. is a very nice guy and he is very understanding and he really likes me a lot and says a lot of nice things about me so I really don’t have a problem mentioning all this to him because I know he will understand. What do you think. BTW in live in NYS",1
"I have always been riddled with depression and anxiety but in the past month, it has been worse than ever. I have had an anxiety/panic attack almost everyday for the past 2 weeks, each days just getting worse. In the past, I would attempt to sleep my depression away, but now I’m afraid to fall asleep because I just slip into sleep paralysis. My Xanax that I take as needed hasn’t even helped with my anxiety. I genuinely do not want to be around anyone but scared to be alone. I want to know it’s going to be okay but these feelings feel so permanent right now. ",1
"Hey, 23(M/AMAB) here.

I’ve always suffered from ADD symptoms, but I was just managing by and thought that I could just do that forever. And I’ve also had depression since I’ve been in middle school. And earlier this year I’ve had a really traumatic experience which I had started therapy after, because I knew that it had caused me PTSD and I needed a way to help with managing that.

I’m in my last year of university and I just started my fall semester along with an internship, and I’m also working on the proposal for my graduation project with a couple of partners, along with a couple of university courses.

I had to stop therapy in late July because my therapist took a maternity leave, which is why I didn’t have anyone to talk to, professionally, about what was going on.
But since the start of this semester, I have felt that my ADD symptoms were becoming more prominent and I can’t focus on anything. I can’t work on any assignments or tasks, and I can’t even do chores around my apartment anymore. Although these symptoms have existed in a form or another before, these two months have been really really hard.

So I started to save up money and decided to go see a psychiatrist. I went to see him two days ago. I explained everything that was going on, but the conversation was really really quick, and I felt that I didn’t tell him everything that I wanted to say, and that I was answering his questions purely based on the scenarios or events that had happened in the past month, and not generally how I have been most of my life.
So that day he ended up diagnosing me with depression and PTSD, and I told him that I thought he would diagnose me with ADD.

And after I left the clinic that day, I had been thinking nonstop about the conversation and what my answers were, and how he could have got to his diagnosis from the way that I worded things, etc.

And so I decided to go back today to talk to him more and have a lengthier conversation. He said that I did show a lot of ADD indications, but he thought that the symptoms were becoming prominent because my PTSD and depression were intensifying those symptoms. So he wanted to try to treat that first, but he said that it would take three months to be reassessed with ADD.

So I expressed that I needed a quicker solution, so he said that if i wanted to, we can flip the elimination process of which diagnosis is causing these symptoms by testing out ADD meds and see how that goes for two weeks.

Now tomorrow will be my first day taking ADD meds (Concerta). But these past two days I took half a pill each of the depression meds, and one pill of Xanax. And he told me to keep those stored until I needed to use Xanax (for panic attacks/breakdowns), or until we decide to go back to them.

So what I’m asking for is advice about my situation and what I should do or follow because I was really scared about using Xanax. I don’t really wanna get into that whole loop. I will be using Concerta daily, like he prescribed, but I’m just new to this whole process and I’m kinda worried about how it’ll go.",1
"Hey, firstable I am not a native speaker, if you can not understand me, ask :).

I am seeking some advice or steps what should I do with my situation. I (27, enby) am without therapist support but actively looking for one, do not have AD because I learnt the hard way it is not okay to stop take them when you feel okay without supervision of psychiatrist. I texted my psychiatrist and waiting but I havent seen her from december 23. I have an appoitment with new one in december this year. 
I am on xanax 25mg right now so I can keep going and be able to work fulltime job.

My struggle is this : I am in a relationship of three years with afab enby person (22). And I feel that some of my (maybe crucial) needs are not met. They are dividing of chores and sxxual incompatibility. For the year of being together I felt abandoned with chores and done them just by myself. We made a plan and it is better but the resentment is surely there and I feel bad that even now it is not okay for me. Then the sxxual compatibility. I am the higher libido person here, read Come as you are, so I know everybody has it different and it is okay. We tried to talk about our issue, tried scheduling and now we had a conversation and I get information that they cant remember when we were intimate because they truly want it not just because they felt obligated. And it is devastating for me. Through our relationship I stopped initiating, and lost myself and my selfesteem in intimacy altogether. 

I love them so much. And I am so terrified to lose them. But I can not stop thinking about break up. I started reading Too good to leave too bad to stay. I talk with my friends, chat gpt, try to journal and make sense out of it. But I cant. I am in the ambivalence of staying or leaving. But I also have never been without partner, one year ago my boyfriend of eight years ghosted me (we were in polyamory for i while) and my partner of now is my closest person. I cant imagine to lose them. And I am feeling like I am not gonna make it. These days I am taking xanax because my anxiety from all of it is so high I cant eat or take care of myself (but I do everything I can to do so). I am worried that it is something fundamentaly wrong with me that I am that paralysed. It is so difficult because I for the first time felt like I can accomplish things next to my current partner, even tho I am in bad job, I started thinking about going back to studies and become a therapist in ten years future. 

We are also seeing couple therapist for the first time in few weeks. But also this is dificult for me cause I feel so broken and that I dont have enough energy to work on this or that I dont trust us. 

I just feel miserable and worried that I am not gonna make it in life either way. 

Please what steps should I take to have more clarity and trust myself? ",1

"For context I (22NB) don’t live with my mom (50F) but I come down sometimes to do work in this town. Lately before I came home I thought about hospitalizing myself bc my mental health deteriorated fast like over a month went from pretty good to I don’t wanna be alive without an identifiable trigger. I’ve known I’m an asshole but I’ve never associated it with my mental health until now. When I’m home I’ll just take a Xanax (prescribed) or take an edible to relax bc I’ve been on the verge of panic attacks every night and they keep me up. When I’m home I kinda just have to deal with it, but I’ve found a way to put myself to sleep that I think might be a symptom of something larger. If my mom goes to bed over an hour earlier than me, which she usually does, I’ll pick a fight with her. They kinda always come up organically too like this one was just about me thinking she enables toxic behaviors (which…I know she does she enables mine) and I decided to start an argument. During these arguments I tend to just let her yell at me and don’t respond and it makes me more anxious but I’ve noticed in the end I’m tired and can do my breathing exercises and calm down. Idk if it’s bc I redirect my anxiety or what but it’s getting just bad bc I know what I’m doing is wrong but keep doing it…should I go through with my plans to hospitalize myself? Bc I’m starting to think this is almost like self harm like letting my mom yell at me so I can feel like I’m punishing myself. ",1
"Incompetent PSYC NP and my Journey

I was on a bunch of medications that had major interactions and I literally needed to go to the mental hospital inpatient because 1. I was suicidal due to all the medications that were fighting each other. And 2. I was so addicted to the high dose, high potency benzos she had me on plus other medication that was extremely hard to kick. So please, take my story and make sure you aren’t getting snowed by a provider you think is trying to help. I will answer any questions and will be happy to help anyone else with their journey! 

Either way, here is my list from when I entered the mental hospital and please feel free to comment and interact. I would love to communicate! Here it goes. 

And one more thing, I am certain about the doses. They may seem ridiculous but I assure you these are all correct meds and dosages. Thank you for the read! 

1. Clonazepam (Klonopin) 2mg three times daily

2. Alprazolam (Xanax) 1mg twice daily as needed. 

3. Venlafaxine ER (Effexor XR) 225mg once every AM. 

4. Bupropion SR (Wellbutrin SR) 400mg once every AM.

9. Lithium Carbonate ER 450mg twice daily. 

10. Olanzapine (Zyprexa) 15mg at bedtime. 

11. Quetiapine ER (Seroquel XR) 100mg at bedtime. 

Just to put this into better perspective as well, I was 18-19 while being treated by this woman with the diagnosis being fresh as well. This was about a year ago. In October of 2023, was when I entered the mental hospital due to this combination. 

Here are the meds that I came out of the mental hospital with (I have an even better group of meds now) and felt 10x more animated and myself. I didn’t feel like a zombie for the first time in 6-8 months. 

1. Venlafaxine ER (Effexor XR) 75 mg once daily in the AM. 

2. Hydroxyzine (Atarax) 50 mg every 4-6 hours as needed.

6. Lurasidone (Latuda) 40 mg once daily at dinner time. 

7. Alprazolam (Xanax) 1mg twice daily as needed.

"I have suffered from anxiety and depression for more than half my life. I also suffer with persistent SI and SH urges. I have generalized (in my opinion it’s chronic) and social anxiety. I have treatment resistant depression. I have been on so many different antidepressants and antipsychotics. I have tried Spravato (esketamine) twice and just did TMS beginning of the year. Nothings ever helped. I started taking Fetzima about two/two and half months ago. No noticeable changes or anything yet. I also take Xanax (1mg up to 3x a day, which usually I always take 3 a day), Buspirone, and Adderall (which I take because I’m chronically exhausted). Over the last three months my mental health has become the worst it’s probably ever been. 

I have no motivation, no energy, can barely leave the house, and have lost all interest in everything. I had to quit the job I loved.
I’m barely scarping by on unemployment.

Here’s what I want to rant about:
I will preface this with saying that I know my family loves me, cares about me, and are here for me. But the way they’ve been acting lately has left me feeling so extremely lonely and very judged. I feel like my depression just ruins everything for everyone, and that everyone is just annoyed with me because of it. Nobody here understands. Like what I say just doesn’t get taken seriously. it seems that they are starting to not really pay me much mind, I don’t know how to describe it. Kind of like they are tired of dealing with me and don’t want to listen to me complain anymore (and I don’t blame them). But now I have no one to talk to or to vent to. My mom use to be my best friend, now she barely even looks up from her IPad when I try talking to her. I end up texting her most the time, and all she really says is “I wish I could help” or asks me if there’s anything she can do to help, and on the rare occasion I do ask for something, there’s always an excuse as to why she can’t help. I don’t know why she even bothers asking anymore. I’m just going to stop talking about how I feel with my family. They don’t want to hear it anymore and they don’t talk to me much anyways. I accidentally saw a text my sister sent my mom right after I had to quit my job, talking about me, saying things like I’m a bum and that I’m just going to ask my parents to pay for everything (which I don’t do). Ive seen other messages between them as well, and all they do is basically shit talk me, saying how I make everything about me and whatnot. I rarely ever talk to anyone besides my mom about how I feel. And never once has my sister ever asked me if I was okay or talked to me about my mental health. And I always tell her I’m there for her if she ever wants to talk or if she needs anything, especially when I know she’s struggling or has had a bad day. 
It’s just absolutely destroyed me knowing that’s how they really feel.

Will my new psychiatrist be able to prescribe my Xanax that I’ve been taking for two years or can they say no,1
My wife started a new job possibly the start of the career she wants. She also has mental health issues. She had to quit her last job because she kept having breaks down and crying due to anxiety and depression. I cover her on health insurance and try and be as supportive as possible. Unfortunately today was the start of her second week and she was having trouble staying awake so I drove her to work (I later found out she had taken a double dose of her prescribed Xanax the night before). She ended up being able to take a short break but accidentally fell asleep and got sent home. They said she is not fired but her boss wants to talk to her tomorrow. Now she is constantly crying and screaming from bedroom cause of her anxiety. I don’t know what to do. ,1
"A few days ago I seemed to randomly develop insomnia? When I’ve always been an oversleeper and a deep sleeper. It’s very weird, for about a week I am sleeping but I wake up every 45 mins - 2 hours range…? Almost on the dot. I check the phone and i fall asleep, I even dream, so I must be in rem sleep but I still will wake up an hour later on the dot from the last time I checked. I usually fall back asleep but I have a bad fear of mania so I’m nervous that’s causing it and I just started a new med also and did also stop Xanax recently but a super small dose. Not sure if either are related? I’m in a mental health program and they said anxiety but I’ve never had this before 😭 pls help 🥹 is this normal ? ",1
"So I had an injury about 10 years ago and required multiple spinal fusions to remedy nerve damage in my pelvis and leg. I have micro spasms in my pelvic muscles that squeeze my prostate and bladder and can keep them irritated for 90% of the day when it happens. These spasms randomly occur but can be brought upon from anything ranging from anxiety(clenching) subconsciously, sitting upright for too long, or even lifting something that makes me strain. Anyways, I’ve been put on every medication known to man until they found a cocktail that worked. I was on gabapentin for years but recently changed to Lyrica for nerve pain, a muscle relaxer(baclofen), and Klonopin. Their reason for the klonopin was that it will keep my subconscious anxiety at bay (never had a problem with actual anxiety), was told it was an excellent muscle relaxer, and lastly while I was having my groin pain it would basically make me care about it less. I never would have guessed it but it actually works great, better than opiates imo. I’ve also tried Ativan, Valium, and Xanax, but the klonopin did the best. However, over the last few years on klonopin I have noticed that I’ve lost interest in everything I once enjoyed. My friends ask me out but I’d rather stay home, I LOVED video games but now I can’t even get myself in the mood to turn them on. I’ve even lost all interest in dating or even attempting to talk to women. I’ve never had a problem with depression which I was starting to think it was, considering I can’t work anymore and most my friends have moved on, not to mention the constant pain. However, my doctor has tried me on anti-depressants but I don’t really think I gave them long enough because I felt they made my emotions worse. We tried amitryptiline, Prozac, Cymbalta, and Wellbutrin. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced this from Klonopin and what countered it, since I have to take it for the pain. I’m on 1mg 3x a day but I only really take it once a day since it lasts so long, but never more than twice a day. My mom has had great experience with buspar, which she said can be used for depression but I haven’t talked to my doctor about it yet. Sorry so long but that’s my story in a nutshell. Any input would be greatly appreciated. ",1
So my dad did k2 for 6 years straight and now he gets pissed off really easily and has panic attacks . He was on Xanax doesn't wanna get back on I need some home solutions to get him cuz he's like me not gonna deal with it cuz doctors don't care what we take. Anything I can buy for him that's not big pharma. Natural or not long as it works. Thanks again ,1
"Hey guys, I need some insight for the time being concerning my mental health (seeing a counselor in a couple days and looking for psychiatry appointment too). I’m really freaked out and have never been a worse mental state.

To try to keep it brief, I got Covid for the the first time in 2021 and had some trouble breathing which triggered some anxiety (I don’t have GAD), but when the Covid was gone I felt all better. Then I got Covid again, and was prepared for the anxiety this time but also developed a hyper-awareness of my breathing. The months following I would have intrusive thoughts about my breathing that I tried really hard to suppress. Well, that worked for a couple of months but was still bothersome to me. 

Fast forward to last week, I was on vacation with my family and on Monday night I took a delta-8 10 mg gummy (I’ve done regular edibles a handful of times). I actually had a really good trip. My sister was upset she missed out on the fun and we took one again the next night, this time I was way less high but had no negative affects. I don’t know if this is relevant but I wanted to include it just in case. 

On my vacation this hyperawareness of my breathing became so intense that I started to worry. I thought to myself, “maybe I’m not the only one who struggles with this” and I looked it up (this was Friday night). Somatic OCD was the first result and realizing I might have it sent me into a mind blowing panic attack. I stopped eating for 3 days and was throwing up/ dry heaving non stop. I went to ER and by this point I was disassociating and was have seizure-like compulsions. They gave me anti anxiety and a sedative that put me to sleep. When I woke up the next morning I felt really tired and tried to go work. My anxiety started to skyrocket at work and I couldn’t function. I picked up my Xanax prescription and it helped me calm down for a bit and went back to work and felt okay for the rest of the night. This morning I knew I couldn’t make it through work without the Xanax and so I took one before I left and had a pretty good day at work. As soon as i felt my medicine wear off I began to skyrocket and have extreme anxiety again, what felt like rolling panic attacks. I don’t know what to do and I’m terrified I will never feel normal again. It’s been a week today since I took the second gummy so I am totally unsure if it’s related. I’m scared of losing my job, I haven’t been able to do a single house chore, and feel the most terrified I’ve ever been. Does anyone have any insight or advice until I can be seen by a professional?

"im in senior year and as i get closer to graduation everything just seems to get worse. i was so happy as a child and my mental state was perfect but ive been dealing with stuff ever since i was 12/13 and it started out with small things but i dont even know how it got this bad. i mean dont hate me for saying this but everything seems so much easier and better for the people around me. they can talk to people without being awkward, do presentations in class without shaking and not being able to breathe and i just feel like God put me on this planet to suffer. I’m extremely inhibited, anxious and have some crazy irrational obsessions. theres also this pit in my stomach that just seems to dig itself deeper every day. it got pretty bad around winter last year but i felt how i got better when summer came around, but this year its just not the same. in fact its getting even worse. i dont even know how ill walk up to the stage to get my diploma in a month without shaking like crazy. i tried so many things to try and solve my problems but it doesnt get better. when i drink with friends they all seem to feel so euphoric but im just completely numb. i know this makes me sound like a crazy narcissist but i feel like i have it the worst and i just wish people could plug their consciousness into my brain and see what it’s like. it will never get better. i will either start abusing xanax and oxy or off myself",1
"Hi everyone,



I'm a 26-year-old graduate math student struggling with severe flashbacks for the past two years (as many as 100 flashbacks a day). I'd like to share my story.



Two years ago, I went through two weeks of extreme anger and anxiety, which led to the breakdown of some friendships. Prior to those weeks, I had been anxious and angry for years, sometimes staying angry about one thing for almost a month. After those two weeks, I began having severe flashbacks of bad events. These flashbacks were so vivid that it felt like I was reliving the past, especially when I was studying. This caused me to stop studying for two months due to the depression and emotional distress.



I decided to travel and stay with my family for a couple of weeks, and during that time, I had no flashbacks. However, when I returned to university, I had a problem with someone, which led to depression and the return of flashbacks (this was in Summer 2022).



The flashbacks were most severe in winter, coinciding with the time I experienced those two weeks of extreme anger. I wasn't exercising or doing anything to break my repetitive routine. I always kept my anger inside because I'm a peaceful person and avoid hurting others, but this meant I hurt myself by internalizing the negative emotions caused by others since my difficult childhood.



I suspected I had ADHD because I exhibited many symptoms. After a diagnosis, the psychiatrist confirmed it and prescribed Ritalin. However, it made me feel worse, reducing my hyperfocus and creative thinking, which are crucial for my abstract math major, so I stopped taking it.



Six months later, I had a flashback of being slapped in the face, and since then, I've felt numb in that area. This caused extreme fear, and I also had serious short-term memory problems, which worsened with each flashback.



Last month, I visited a psychiatrist and told him about the flashbacks, numb face, and memory problems. He diagnosed me with cyclothymic disorder (a mild form of bipolar disorder) and prescribed lamotrigine. The medication helped reduce the severity of the flashbacks, but they haven't completely stopped.



I decided to share my entire history with the psychiatrist, including my childhood and various symptoms. He then diagnosed me with Asperger's syndrome (routine problems) with high anxiety and prescribed risperidone (an antipsychotic) along with lamotrigine. He explained that the flashbacks are due to anxiety and a serotonin imbalance that risperidone could address.



However, I'm afraid of taking risperidone and other antipsychotics due to their side effects. I've already experienced side effects with lamotrigine, like hypnagogic hallucinations and insomnia. The psychiatrist refused to prescribe another medication, but after insisting, he prescribed clonazepam, which is similar to Xanax and has dangerous addiction risks and side effects. I'm concerned about the potential long-term negative changes these medications could cause in my brain.



I want to try psychotherapy, but my doctor says it won't help in my situation. I'm also considering natural remedies; valerian root helped a little but made me very sleepy.



My anxiety is so severe that I am afraid someone will push me while I'm walking. I had an accident 10 years ago, and my mind constantly worries about it when I'm walking. I'm even afraid to cross the street because of an accident I had years before.



Since childhood, I've had a lot of potential, always inventing and creating things. I want to use my mental abilities to make the world better and help people, but I'm afraid this problem will hinder me permanently. I'm exhausted.



I need your advice. Has anyone else experienced this?



Sorry for the long post.",1
"Hello everyone. I have been suffering with severe anxiety and panic disorder and it’s gotten really bad this past month. I want to know what medication has helped everyone. I have done some trial and error. I can’t stand the side effects, but I also need to get a hold of myself. I’m seeing a psychiatrist, but they don’t seem to be listening to me. I also don’t want to get addicted. So please let me know what works for you, I know everyone is different and it works in different ways for everyone, but i’d really like to know what’s helped people. Thank you! ",1
"I’m stopping all my meds because I’m worried the pharmacist touched my pills and had a stomach bug and I’ll get sick if I take them. So rather than risk a stomach bug, I’m quitting all my meds (2mg Xanax XR, 90mg Duloxetine, 10mg Focalin, 10mg Lexapro) cold turkey. It’s day 7, and I am not having a great time. At all.

My anxiety is through the roof, my OCD a thousand times worse than it was before. Everything is going to make me sick, or so my brain says. I want to eat EVERYTHING after having no appetite for years, which is genuinely kind of uplifting, except I’m too scared to touch anything lest I catch a stomach bug. Minimal food, a few sips of water a day, no pills whatsoever for a week now.

I’m remarkably sensitive to light and sound, and the mood swings are hellish at best. The headaches, dizziness, and sweats have come and gone already. GERD is worse than usual, but I’m managing. Right now my main complaint is that I’m so cold that I think I might die. I’m shivering under a blanket in jeans and a thick sweater. 

I’m mostly just afraid of vomiting from withdrawal. It hasn’t happened yet, but I know it’s common and I am TERRIFIED. I’m doing all this to avoid that, you know? Too scared of vomiting to take my meds that I know help me (to a degree.) Hell, I’m also prescribed Zofran (a medication that prevents vomiting) as needed, but I’m too scared to take it for the same reason I described for stopping all my daily meds.

What’s the likelihood I can make it through this withdrawal period without vomiting? Should I have myself committed so they have to force my pills in me/give via IV, or am I okay to just quit my meds? I know my mental health will suffer off of my meds, but I’m not great on them either. (Obviously, since I’m quitting my meds that I’ve been on for years because I’m too scared of getting sick.) I just don’t want to vomit.

I don’t know what to do. I’m not sure what’s a real concern anymore. I need some guidance, but my roommate is gone for the next five days, and I’m not in a logical state of mind to know what to do. Please tell me what to do to not vomit. Thank you.",1
"hi guys! i'm normally not someone to reach out like this, but i'm very desperate and don't know, who could help me in the short amount of time i have.

thank you in advance for reading and for any tipps you might have! also please be kind in case of spelling errors, english is not my first language and i'm pretty sleep deprived.

so, i'm working on my bachelors thesis, which is due on the 31st, and i have hardly anything. i have the background information like my literature (the very most and important of it) and i've done the data analysis, but i have almost nothing written down. so, i have to write at least 28 pages in 4 days, which is horrible, but not absolutely impossible. though i'm a hardcore perfectionist, i just wanna pass and don't care if it's shit at this point.

i study psychology and i have no problems with the topic, i never really had to study and i think due to my personal interest in psychology, i never had to study a lot and actually like researching about anything in this topical field. also, i'm a good writer and actually like tasks like essays.

BUT! i'm a mental disaster. i'm not going to write about all of it, but i do have problems with procrastination due to extreme fear of failure. i also have adhd and severe depression, which both make it hard for me to focus. i believe to have cptsd, but this together with the adhd are new approaches which i have not worked into fully yet. and yes, i am in treatment (not right now due to time) but it doesn't really help me with my current problems. so i have bigger issues which i have not worked through yet and they sure contribute to my current situation, but for now i need a ""quick fix"".

alright, i tried to keep it short, but should've known better, i never do. so thank you if you read all of that and i hope it kind of gives you a picture of my current situation. now my biggest problem is, that as soon as i get to work on the paper, i get panic attacks (which i think is also one of the reasons, why i avoided it). before i get to work i'm optimistic and make a list and everything, but as i just wanted to read into a study again and continue with my lists (to do etc.), my heart is racing, i'm getting dizzy and can't focus on anything. i do the common things like breathing and breaking everything down into small steps, and it helps for a moment, but as soon as i get back to it, it starts again.

i am on meds and have xanax for these cases, but it didn't help at all, though it usually works and sometimes can even knock me out.

as writing that much in that short amount of time is hard already, i really can't have these panic attacks right now! i've been in therapy for over 10 years and know many exercises and can usually count on my rational thinking when faced with problems, but with this i feel so helpless, which gives me more anxiety. also, this situation is very new to me; i had blackouts in some tests in the past, but i'm new to panic and constant underlying fear, and it just is so hard for me to still perform with it. in the past i was quite good with just putting my mental problems away for the time i needed to function, but this hasn't worked anymore lately.

ok, this is really the finishing line. before you suggest having a break and finish my bachelors degree later etc., this is not an option; if i fail to hand it in on the 31st, i'm restricted from studying psychology in switzerland, forever. so i have to finish this or i don't only not have the degree, but i will also not have to chance to finish it somewhere else in switzerland.

i just realized i haven't really asked a question, so: do you have any tipps for me on how to handle my panic so i can at least work on my paper?

THANK YOU!",1
"I’ve been on Prozac for almost a year & while it started off rocky, these past 6 months have been a lot better for me. While I still have bad moments of anxiety/panic it usually doesn’t last long & im able to work through it. But recently, today especially, I’m feeling off. It’s just a really weird mental feeling that I'm not used to; I don't feel in control and almost like l'm going crazy or will spiral at an moment. It doesn’t feel like normal panicking/anxiety from what I’m used to. It feels like derealization. I took half of a .25 mg Xanax and I think it helped a little (or I’m convincing myself it did, but I’ll take it). Best way to describe this feeling is when you're drunk trying to get a grip on yourself and talk to yourself and say that you're okay and to stay in control, but you know you fully can’t. I have also been drinking more, usually every weekend and I drink liquor and usually get very tipsy each time. I’m sure that doesn’t help. I’d love any advice, reassurance, what’s worked for you/what hasn’t etc. Thank you. ",1
"I was just prescribed Xanax to help with extreme mood swings and depression when I have PMS, Im already on a bunch of other medications that are supposed to help with my depression anxiety and mood swings when I dont have PMS but apparently its not enough. Im really scared of taking Xanax and you hear all the time how Xanax is highly addictive and can ruin your life. Im only 17,this seems like too strong of a drug for someone my age",1
"Hi everyone, sorry if this doesn't fit here, but in kind of at a loss... 
I've got some medicine prescribed from my psychiatrist, but I'm too afraid of using it to harm myself or worse to actually go get it... 
I've got alprazolam (us Xanax) for acute anxiety, but a few years ago I've already tried using it to kill myself. 

Now I'm in a similarly bad place mentally, and I'm not sure what to do haha",1
"	I have GAD which has been causing lots of problems for years. It started with anxiety and racing thoughts, followed by 6 days of no sleep. This was about 10 years ago. Since then I have been on zopiclone, 1 7.5mg pill to help sleep and after trying numerous anti depressents settled on mirtazlipine. 15-30mg. My anxiety has never gotten any better and some nights I can sleep and some I can't. The anxiety also causes me back and neck problems from my muscles always being tense. In 10 years I have noticed no improvement and over the last couple years it has gotten so much worse. I have tried all natural remedies.... meditating, exercise, GABA, melitonin, Cognetive behavior therapry. Nothing makes a difference. I have found two things that cleared up my anixety and did help my sleep. First is Ketamine, over long term use my anxiety goes away, my muscle pains clear up and my sleep gets much better. Problem is I can't legally get Ketamine as it's only in trail phases in Canada and i'm no where near the clinic. I have a source for it but it's extremely expensive. I am convinced that with steady use over a longer period this could cure my problems. Things have been going so well. The cost is financially ruining me though. My source I get my ketamine recently started carrying Xanax (tested and it is pure). I decided to try it recreationally and it was like a god send at first. It was a cheaper option, it cured my anxiety, I slept better then I had in years and felt like a new man. I was even able to stop taking my mirtazapine and zopiclone. I was off the mirtazipine for 2 weeks and the zopiclone for 6 days. Then it went bad. My anxiety was gone but I stopped being able to sleep. Then my anxiety came back worse then ever. I started back on my other two medications and continued with the xanax. I increased the xanax dosage and my anxiety was good but I can't fall asleep or if I do its a light sleep and only a couple of hours before I'm awake again and not able to get back to sleep no matter if I take more of any of the three. I have hardly slept in a week now, my anxiety is horrible. Im now taking 2mg of xanax to just barely take the edge of, 30mg of mirtazlipine and 7.5mg of zopiclone and none of it is helping. I wish I had never started the xanax as it's made things worse after 3 weeks of taking it. Now I don't know what to do. I have almost zero help with our horrible medical system. My docotor wants me off zopilcone so won't increase me dosage, so if I take two pills to fall asleep it means I have a day were I can't take one at all. They won't pescribe benzo's of any kind. They will only try different anti depressants, which I've tried them all and they make no difference. Also I am not depressed but no one will listen. They say my depression is the cause of the anxiety, but I am not nor have I ever been depressed. They won't directly treat my anxiety as they say its just a symptom. I feel my anxiety is the cause not the symptom. Please help! ",1

Firstly  
If someone give me some realistic advise or the correcr combination of words, in every situatuion there exiat some combination of words that could totally change whole situation but 99,9% of time we really cant know wich one are and wich arent at the time. So every reaction is great for me, maybe the one from you will make me not wanna end it all, or maybe different one frome someone else will totally change my life and i will never think bou sui c ide ever again a really dont know but i wanna try everything before i give up. Very good karma and wishing good luck to everyone even reading all of what im gonna write here, you have my respect and part of love that is left in me.  
  
Secondly  
I would like to apologize for some minor issues or mysteak ( call it as you like ) in my post, enlish isnt my first language and so i could write it faster till i remade my decision to share this i wont use ,, ' "" and some other interpucntion that isnt set to my laptop since it itsnt made for english market.   
  
Thirdly  
Some context for my backstory and real start of the post ( i will try to make it as short as possible )   
When i was around 5/6 ( he was 18/19 or 16/17 dont rlly remember eneven if i was 4/5 or 5/6 bu it was happenin for around year app. 1-2 times month) i was molested by my cousin but he manipulated me into thinking is normal,  jist aftel lot of years it came back to me since the memory was long locked and thats when i realized its was not normal ( normal in my family trusts me that it was happening cu i ,,didnt said anything back then, or a seem happy when he was on family reunions, or i stayed at some different cousins party when he came there or much more but thats the main reasons they dont belive it happened )  
  
In my 10 years my father left my mother, me  and my sister and started new family after living with my mother for 25yrs wich i didnt took any good but i survived it cuz my mother started dating father of my friend from our very small city whom i took as brother. So we moved all together, me, the new mothers partner and my brother ( even not by blood but by feelings for sure ) My sister is 16 yrs older so she was living elsewhere  
  
Everything seems ok till my 15, im living in biggest city in my country by then, my new older brother ( older by 5 yrs ) learned me to skate, smoke weed somethimes any by like what some cringe tv show was cool kid even tho everything i said did everyone just not nerds.  
  
When i was 15 he got diagnosed with cancer and he dies 14 days after my 16th birthday. i was completly desroyed and thought that that was rock bottom till my best friend for 3 years ( since i moved to the main city ) dies in my hands not  even 2 months after the dead of my so called brother - then i started using meth like crazy cuz thaths cheap and everywhere here, xanax, ambien and ketamine, from time to time i popped some E but the meth was daily thing. but becouse the dead of my brother my mother doesnt pay to mmuch attention to the world after and finds about it afet full year, i go to rehab for yungsters and stayed 3 months, after i got out i was sober for 8 months ( only got beer on fridays with friends or twice a mont app joint but thats rlly all for 8/9 months)  
  
After that i got prescribed DHC dihydrocodeine ( less strenght compared to morphine but like 10x more compared to classical codeine or tramadol ) wich when i popped 400mg without any opiate tolerance felt like fakin heaven, no isomnia like meth, noone can rlly tell that im high soo i got the doc to overprescribe for about 4/5 months after wich he got on my plan and cut me off but that was late.I imedealty started searching for opioids on streets or web or from  friends, everywhere, after around 14days of nonstop internet formums and annoying my friends i got one name of friend of my friend that he takes something called oxycodone and that sould do what im looking for, it did. soo much my tolerance was after app year and half after meeting him soo high i was doin 8-12 80mg a day ( we in europe still have them original oxycontin but we took every pill that had some opioid stronger then morphine includning morphine, anything less potent lost value to us ) i go tru wds nonstop, lots of friend overdoses so i try rehab again ( i was freshly 20 at that alreaey time in 3yr relationship wich started when i was 17, with the most beautiful girl wich was studyin medicine and that agreed to our relations ship when i was in phase just doin DHC, lean and didnt tell about everytime so she thought i just take some weak opioid from timew to time ), singhed of that rehab after 30days and lost my main pills plug, thats when i started smoking heroin at that time my dad foound out about his cancer and died only 2 months after bein moved to different city cuz even in the relationship we agreed on pause, i found new girl in the new city with wich i fell in love insanely and wich i have found hanged in our flat 3 months after living together, thats when i started shootinh that heroin and moved back to my mothers flat  
  
For year i steal, shoot, sell just being jungie like every other  
after year like that my mother tells me its even rehab or street, so i try rehab again, this time i stayed for 7 mpnths and was rlly feeling like thats last time i see inside of rehab. . y  
  
today its app. 1 year ago since i left that rehab, after i left i lasted 14 days so i tryied metadone wich worke best from all but still is not great, yea i dont need to steal and i hav job,  but job in wich is still some trouble cuz my using becouse somethimes i smoke some crack to my methadone, or pop some xan and again a signed that i want to different type to rehab then last time, its the only type i havent tried but fuck seein my mother cry all the time, seein my gf hanged in dreams or seein all that ppl that shouldnt be dead is too much, i dont have the strenght. i dont know if i should end it rn or wait the 4 months waiting list to this so called ,,bes rehab"" in our country or just dont wait after i came from there, relapse like everytime and kill myself anyway, cuz if this wont work im gonna end it 110% cuz i tried it all but learning from my past i dunno if im not just prolonging my remorse and hate for existence and for all that trauma for another year just like, idk even know why ???? i already have a rope",1
"Trigger warning ⚠️ 

How do I find out what sort of therapy I need? Some details:

 My income is currently extremely low. But I would reach out to private places and see if they could work out a reduced payment plan of some sort. 

I’m 34 weeks pregnant and my baby might be put into the care system (Ireland) so if that happens I will more than likely have the funds for private therapy as I will be able to start working full time (once I get through post partum). 

I know I’m typing this out really casually but make no mistake I’m fucking torn deep down and feel ashamed of myself. 

I was diagnosed with EUPD (BPD) and social phobia in remission (whatever was meant by that) when I was 16/17, anxiety when I was about 15. 

Although my therapist has said she doesn’t see any symptoms of BPD in me and anyone under 18 shouldn’t be given them types of diagnoses since their personality isn’t fully developed yet. 

I used drugs regularly between the ages of 12-21. Started off with just weed (I thought it was completely normal to smoke weed even though I was experiencing some sort of delusional/psychotic or schizophrenic episodes), there was spice (synthetic weed) going around also, a lot of the time nobody knew (well at least I didn’t) the difference between whether it was weed being passed around or spice. 

Then it was ecstasy and mdma. Pills like Xanax etc. Then alcohol. Then speed when I was about 16. Then cocaine at 17 and I started going to NA meetings last January which helped me hugely. 

The first time I was “raped” (my doctor said it wasn’t rape, my therapist said it was) was 2 months after I turned 14.

 I was on and off contact with him until I realised in therapy how fucked up what he did to me was. My therapist encouraged me to make a report about him and I did that. 

It’s been about 3 years since I done that and the process is very slow but he continues to reach out to me and I report it every time. I haven’t spoken to him in a number of years, yet he still reaches out and sends texts as if we are friends. 

I don’t keep the communication open or lead him on in any way, as I block the account he texts me off every time. He just makes a new one again after a while and I keep blocking them. This only happens every few months. Let’s say every 3/4 months. 

I met my current bf when I had just turned 17. We have been on and off since then.

 I found out it was an abusive relationship a couple months ago when I was speaking to a social worker about something unrelated, and she asked if he had ever put his hands on me. 

I opened up slowly over the course of meeting her a few times, then I ended up telling her pretty much everything. 

Because of the details I’ve told her about my relationship, she was required to make a report to Tusla (CPS) on three separate occasions. 

Both her and Tusla have told me that my relationship is dangerous and they’re surprised he hasn’t killed me yet. That doesn’t make sense to me. 

But I know they are most likely right and it’s just hard for me to believe someone who tells me he loves me so much, would take my life.

The thing is deep down I know it’s a matter of time before he kills me, and if he doesn’t kill me soon, he will make sure my life reaches newer depths of hell all the time, possibly until I go psychotic or end up taking my life. 

I feel like I’m losing my mind. He lies so much and hurts me so much that im beginning to lose trust in everyone, including my family. 

There’s another thing: my mum abandoned me a few times when I was a child/baby. Once I was in a daycare and from what I recall her telling me, she picked me up on weekends only. It mustve been between the ages of 2 and 3. 

When I was about 4, she left me with my family in our home country, then came back a few months later and ripped me away from home and family, then we moved to Ireland with her new bf who obviously didn’t speak our language so I was confused and scared. 

She worked two jobs and her new bf worked full time as well so I think I rarely seen her at some points of my childhood.

 She got severe depression when I was still in primary (elementary?) school and I remember waiting hours to be picked up from school because she slept in. This was a regular occurrence. 

She also used to beat me and my sister and I remember crying and begging for her to stop, but what hurt more was hearing my sister crying for her to stop. I felt powerless. 

Right now I’m a doormat to my boyfriend. I’m shocked at myself for becoming so low of a person. I’ve gotten to the point where I’d give anything for him. My baby and even my life. 

I remember a week ago when he was suffocating me in my sleep, I had woken up in a sweat, I assume from the lack of oxygen, I don’t know how long he had been doing it for. But I woke up and I didn’t even move. I just waited and waited. 

This happened a few times. A couple times I had woken up and after a few minutes of me being awake he asked me to move over. Another couple times I couldn’t take it anymore so I moved/took his arm/hand off my neck and could breathe properly again. 

I remember feeling warm and fuzzy, probably from the lack of oxygen, and thinking to myself that if I’m killed, there’s no place I’d rather be than in his arms. 

I know this isn’t normal behaviour or how normal brains function. I should want to fight for my life and fight for myself and my baby. But I don’t. Instead I’m fighting the urge to fight. Instead I’m fighting myself to surrender and give up everything. 

I am a doormat to my boyfriend and I keep choosing to be with him even though it’s making both my body and mind sick. 

The life I’m living is far from normal. I would expect this sort of chaos from a drug user or alcoholic. But I’m free from substances/alcohol and yet I feel like I’m losing my mind worse than ever. 

My body is exhausted and so is my mind. I feel broken into pieces.",1
"Dizziness started in mid November 2021, went to Canberra on the 10th of December and I had my first near faint experience followed by high heart beat and palpitation. 

Dizziness and lightheaded was followed till the 28th of December when I nearly fainted again and had really high heart rate: went to hospital. They did blood work and ecg couldn’t find a probable cause. Went to hospital again 3 days later and no findings were evident. Upon my 3rd visit to hospital X-ray was done off my chest and nothing was found. I was bedridden for 6 weeks, everyday was a battle for life, I felt like I was in septic shock everyday. I had to get iv fluids about 10 times because of dehydration, I sweated constantly with no appetite for water or food.

Symptoms 

Lightheaded 
Dizziness
Heart gets tired quickly 
Sometimes my arms and hands become a little numb.
My head feels tension.
heat in my abdomen, back and my ears get hot.
Feels like a pulsating feeling through my body during a bad episode 
Sometimes left shoulder feels warm
My eyes sometimes drop tears randomly
Unable to concentrate at times
Shortness of breath during episode 
There’s always a tense feeling in my chest and around my heart area. Sometimes hits my lower abdomen and I feel nausea makes my stomach make noises. I have difficulty sleeping my head spins more when I close my eyes. I wake up between 1-3am with a weird feeling as if I’m scared or something. Vision sometimes becomes blurry. Fatigue and tiredness. Little sudden Noises scare me. Whenever I have a episode that peaks, my hands and feet get sweaty and I feel heat. My hands and feet sometimes get cold. The feeling in my mid left chest area I can’t explain but it’s as if my muscles are vibrating. When I stand up it’s seems my head and chest symptoms get worse for about a minute and then settle down. Same thing happens when I lay down. It gets worse for a minute till it goes back to how it was. Sometimes I can feel it hitting my front part of my head and my sinus feels tense as well. As well as my ears feel the pressure. Lying down seems to reduce some tension in my head. I feel bad 80% of the day really bad 15% of the day and alright 5% of the day.


Let’s go back to my childhood, my earliest memory is probably when I was around 10. If I would focus on my breathing it felt like I couldn’t breath anymore. I also had these unexplained spinning and dizziness at a young age during sleep time. Doctors couldn’t find anything. I was always a scared kid thinking about the worse case scenario that might kill me but in reality it was overthinking. In highschool a few times I nearly fainted out of the blue. Sometimes during sports I’ll hit a point where out of no where my heart would start racing and my breathing would become laboured. Sometimes over excitement caused this as well.

Now medications 

Lexapro 40mg for 6 months, no benefits. Made me really bad during the first 2 weeks and kinda of settled after that, dumbed the depressive symptoms but that’s about it. Felt much better after coming off, it definitely made my condition worse. Derealisation, fatigue, tiredness, forgetfulness. All of it.

Zoloft 50mg for 18 days and 100mg for 3 days, had a panic attack on day 3 I thought it was Zoloft but found it to be thc later on. Discontinued Zoloft then. No benefits during the 18 days on 50mg and made my condition way worse.

Paxil 20mg for 2 months, probably one of the strongest reactions to any ssri, daily panic attacks losing my mind, as if there’s a laughter in my head but it’s my internal monologue creating it but still I was losing it. Pushed on for 2 months and it just made me worse as the days went on.

Agomelatine 20mg no benefits, daily panic attacks, took it for about 36 days.

Pristiq, I’m on day 54 and I’ve stopped taking it, my last dose was on Wednesday not sure how to stop. It’s making me worse, mood is swinging, brain fog and all other symptoms are reappearing on this medication.

Clonidine didn’t do much except relax my body alittle

Lyrica, knocked me out at 25mg and made me tired. No benefits.

Valium 5mg, very small relief, short benefits 3-5 hours, more of a muscle relaxant, addictive in nature.

Clonezapam 1mg, small amount of relief, short relief 3-5 hours. 

Xanax 2mg, haven’t tried 

Ativan 1mg only have tried 0.5mg and it didn’t do much.

Seroquel 25mg, good for sleep, couldn’t sleep for more then 4 hours for the last 5 years or so, now I get a solid 8 hours, it’s not a 100% good quality sleep but it gets the job done, I don’t feel tired through the day as before I got sick.

Epilim haven’t tried chickenend out

Lamictal discontinued on day 3 after developing rash

Lithium 500mg, 37 days. Left like losing my mind not sure if adverse reaction to the lithium or it was some kind of discontinuation I was getting from the lexapro. 

Prozac 4 days to bridge off lexapro 

Thc/cbd oil, made me go full panic mode for 4 hours each time I tried it. Very similar to what I was feeling with the Paxil minus the laughter side effect.

My mind always feels like as if something is off,

As my overall condition gets worse my brain fogs becomes really bad and my hands and feet become so cold to the touch, 

I become very forgetful

I can never stop thinking about my condition, my mind is occupied by it 24/7

When I’m on medications l as ssri’s I get irrational fears such as being allergic to nuts or something crazy. But seems to go away after a month when discontinuing  the medication,

Lightheaded, feel like my neck muscles are so tense that my brain isn’t getting enough blood.

I’m hyper focused on all bodily functions physical or Cognitive, if I suspect something that is schizophrenic or damaging I get a mini panic attack. But panic attack do occur for no reason as well most of the times.

I’ve done all the physical body checkups before the anxiety diagnosis. Everything check out well physically.",1
"I have genuinely attempted to receive help in my area and surrounding areas. I have done everything from every damn 1st line pill to taking benzos daily for months, the only thing that workd was benzos but we know those aren't prescribed long term and they are dangerous blahblahblah. I think me jumping off a building or swerving my car into a bridge is a little more dangerous but okay doc. 

I recently did Transcranial magnetic stimulation as a last ditch attempt to relieve some of my anxiety. It did nothing. More money flushed.

I have gotten on and off every standard pill people blab about. Trintellix, Rameron, LExapro, Zoloft, Prozac, Seroquel, Wellbutrin, Buspar, Effexor, Pristiq, Paxil, and more.

These serotogenic  type drugs only make me apathetic, chronically exhausted and dead inside. Not to mention weight gain and sexual dysfunction. There is no joy or relief of anxiety. I have taken Xanax, Klonopin with great success but those are never given more than a couple weeks due to addiction potential or whatever.

I just feel like the only things that work aren't available and anything that might help I've tried and have yet to get relief.

Some would be very blessed to be in my position. I have a good job, good savings, nice car, nice house, beautiful fiancee who loves and cares about me but I am so stressed out, anxious and high key that I can't even go meet my fiancee's parents for breakfast. Then the stress of them wondering why, us having to always make an excuse makes me want to just off myself to save myself the shame and embarrassment. 

I sometimes just feel like I can't receive successful treatment and maybe I need to end myself so my fiancee and family can find someone who is less miserable and who can actually enjoy the things they have. I am just tired of trying to fight to survive and waking up miserable, irritated, panicky, shaky, rough..

For many years I was able to fight these thoughts but the last couple weeks the stress of upcoming marriage, lack of treatment options, has me really just not wanting to suffer anymore. I flew home 12 hours in a panic where I was passing in and out of consciousness and sweating so bad the flight attendant thought I spilled something on my clothes. My psych told me to take benadryl for the anxiety. I just feel like a fucking joke and am tired of suffering. 

&#x200B;

I have tried psychadelic retreats as well, then I even did 2 years completely substance free even cutting out caffeine and still felt miserable like this. My anxiety chokes me out, makes me feel like I am going to die any second, keeps me awake for days at a time, I just cant see myself pushing through this much longer anymore. I dream of dying. 

If I refuse to go inpatient somewhere, what are my options? Is there some new therapy or pill that I'm not aware of? I refuse to go back to standard talk therapy or CBT, it didn't work at all and only worsened me after 4 years of trying going sometimes once a week.",1
"I might need some insight from someone who's been experiencing something similar because I gotta sort out all the knots of the loop I'm stuck into in order to get the fuck out of it one way or another. Briefly, here's the list of the things I've experienced or done:  
  
I started suffering from heavy insomnia (sleeping max 3/4 hours a night) in April/May 2023 due to many factors (anxiety, stress, overthinking and heat mainly, all boosted by the fact that I was a daily weed smoker) and it never went away, nowadays I sleep max 4/5 hours a night  
  
At the end of June, I did a bad mix of weed/cocaine/MDMA/ecstasy at a party and from that night onwards my mind went 100% blank, I was never the same again, I lost any spontaneous thought and my inner monologue, still I have to figure out if I have a brain damage or if it is DPDR  
  
After that event, I started feeling anxious and depressed, not because of any particular reason or trauma but because I felt like I lost myself, my ability to think (I was very sharp and critical before), my sarcasm and in general my cognitive abilities, moreover I started to worry about the fact that I irreversibly damaged my brain like a dumbass, since now I can barely hold conversations because no topics would pop up inside my head, nor jokes or anything: it would also take ages to find the words to put down a sentence, but the problem is that any case scenario that sentence isn't ""thought"", it's just an automatic response to whatever the other person is saying, since I don't have a single thought (when instead before I was stormed by hundreds of random/spontaneous thoughts a day, most probably I have undiagnosed ADHD) passing through my brain and I feel like I'm in a zombie mode, so I don't reply based on what the other is saying but with the first fast thing that I come up with because I can't do anything else.  
  
Also, my memory has been deeply affected, mostly the short term one, and the brain fog/dissociation just makes it worse.  
  
Right now it's been two weeks that I've been put under Xanax and Zoloft (from June I was taking Lormetazepam only at night) and I'm still waiting to see if there's gonna be any improvements, but I'm having a hard time understanding if this is depression, if it's DPDR from that event and I just have to wait time to pass, if it's brain damage (yeah I gotta book a scan for that asap just to relieve the worry) or if it's just the long term sleep deprivation/chronic insomnia making me feel like this (which I honestly don't know how to fix since I tried everything like sleep hygiene, meditation, reading etc, I can fall asleep in 15 minutes but no matter what after 4/5 hours I'm awake, not energized but still feeling in that dreamy/blank mind condition 24/7)  
  
Has anyone gone through the same and in case could provide some advice/relief?  
  
Thanks in advance to you all and wish you all the best",1
"Hi, I'll start apologizing if i commit any grammar mistakes, english is not my first language and im kinda of nervous right now. I'm 19.
Getting to the point, it's 2am in my country and i think if i fall asleep I'll die. Probably totally psychological (cant be sure otherwise I wouldn't be having this problem)
Yesterday was the same. i was drinking an energy drink and didn't finish it bc i started thinking i was gonna have a heart attack. Then i couldn't sleep, i went to the hospital with my mom because I just needed to hear from a doctor my heart was normal. It was, they gave a xanax and i went home and slept. In the hospital i felt safer bc if I did have a heart attack i was near doctors so it would be ok. Tonight i feel the same (no energy drink tonight). Yesterday, like today, i could feel kind of a burning sensation in my heart area. I can really feel it but i think whats causing it is the anxiety or whatever but its hard to keep myself grounded and remember that. I'm crying for no reason through this, but writing here makes me focus on something and relax a little.
i went to sleep today around 22pm, had a light sleep and woke up now, with this fear again.
when i close my eyes and start to fell asleep i feel I'll stop breathing, or my heart will stop, or something else will happen and I'll die, and when i open my eyes my vision is weird, so i forcefully wake up again. I also, for a few seconds, doubted im real or something. Anyway, i wanted to know if this could be a panic or anxiety attack, i think it's weird to have two in two nights. During the day i was fine, but still could feel the weird sensation in my chest.
For context I've always been very afraid of death but don't think much about so this is new.
i wish i could sleep in a hospital with a machine watching me. i at least wanted to go there again but I wont make my mom do this again, since we went  yesterday ""for nothing"". im afraid im crazy or something, and wanted to vent",1
"I don't know what to do.  
  
I have severe anxiety... and when I say this I don't mean when TikTokers say ""I have to deal with anxiety so much!"".  
  
Instead my anxiety is so bad it's to the point where I sweat any time I'm in a public place. I have a sweatshirt I wear EVERY SINGLE TIME I leave the house. Even in 80F weather. My eyes dart around looking for threats. When my dog barks at someone near the house I get dizzy and struggle to breathe.  
  
My anxiety is the REAL REAL bad kind. I've never met anyone with the same level of anxiety I have.  
  
It started when I was 14 and moved houses. My doctor prescribed me Xanax. It worked wonders for my anxiety, but she never told us it was addictive. I was given my bottle to go to school and take as needed. I would take them too often and start falling asleep and stumbling in the hallways, needing to hold the wall to not fall.  
  
Not too long after that I started buying them and I found the direct source. Like as close as you can get to buying it from the company itself. So I got thousands of doses for $20. I went through it like candy, sleeping, failing school, sent to mental wards constantly.  
  
As it got worse and I got older I started losing huge chunks of memory, even from before I started taking it I couldn't remember things people would try to remind me of. I also became an asshole. My lifelong friends started to hint that they wanted me to go away. So I did.  
  
A little after that I'd get in fist fights with my older brother and my sister told her kids they can't see me.  
  
That's when I got clean for the first time. At age 20.  
  
Not much longer after that I realized... being clean and trying to deal with the anxiety wasn't worth it. I wanted to fall asleep and never wake up. So I relapsed.  
  
I decided I'd rather destroy my brain and sleep my life away as long as I felt a little bit of peace from the hell of living in my brain.  
  
I got in trouble and got clean again at 23. Dealt with it for 3 years, never left my room. Never. Only for food and doctors.  
  
I'm now 27, relapsed.  
  
I've never had a job. Never learned to drive. Have no friends. Never talked to or touched a girl (and wouldn't have the confidence or opportunity to).  
  
Therapy does not help me. I've tried countless medications.  
  
It's been years that I've been wishing I fall asleep and don't wake up.  
  
I've never... lived a life... and I honestly don't know what to do. The loneliness is really starting to get to me.",1
"

A few weeks ago I lost the love of my life, 3 years relationship it was my failure, it was my perfect match and I screwed up the relationship for taking her granted… Since that I can’t move on. 5 Weeks just laying on the couch and smoke cigarettes. Went to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with major depressive disorder. 2 antidepressivum, quetiapin and Xanax… 2 month unfit for work.. Each day I Google methods how to kill myself. I can’t move on. I can’t live with the regret. I just want my life to stop now.. And I don’t even know what I expect to post it here.. Nobody can help me in my situation. I lost 8kg body weight. I really can’t anymore… I gave up on myself!",1
"First of all, sorry for my bad English  
To be honest I don’t know what to expect here, because it’s my fault and I can’t forgive myself. I guess ""You are an asshole and now you got what you deserved"" is the only thing you can reply...  
I try to keep it as short as possible!  
I’m a male nurse and visit people at their homes to help them. 3 years ago she was a student and had an internship at our company. Sometimes I had her with me the whole day while working. We realized there was something between us, but she was in a relationship at that time so I didn’t care. After her internship endet she wrote me at Christmas, told me she left her boyfriend and we began to chat. We already fell in love and after 1,2 months we met and from there our relationship started. When she finished nursing school she joined our company (to understand for everyone, we don’t see each other at working, we all have our patients and do the work alone). Each day we talked about what patient we had and everything else, that was so unbelievable nice that we had that in common. Beside of that we had so much more in common, same genre in films, she was a gamer too, we had the same idea of the future, it was all meant to be.. we were so open to each other, we knew each others life 100%. And to be honest my life isn’t cool for everyone, lazy ass weed smoker all my life, lived my youth to the fullest where other people would say: what the fuck, that’s not attractive. I told her everything about my life and we were so close to each other… now that she’s gone I reflected everything of my life and the relationship. I realized the relationship was so much ego driven by me. It was mostly about me and what I want.. I did care of her a lot and made things to make her happy but there are so many things she wanted but I didn’t care.. the last 1/2 year we got often in arguments and it was always the same.. That may sound stupid now but in arguments I think respect is most important. And yeah I know I didn’t care about her needs so there I wasn’t respecting her.. But at arguments it was always the same: she got louder, yelled, insult me - then I got personal on her - insulting her and after that she attacked me and I defended myself. So we went to couple-therapy hoping to get better at communicating arguments. She has borderline so I guess that’s why arguments got that way, she didn’t know how to handle that or my egoistic ass character.. I guess it’s not even her fault, I should have been more empathic..  
Beside all of that our relationship was a dream, at least for me and my ego driven character… I guess it wasn’t the dream for her.  
1 month ago I was out with some friends, drank too much and got home via taxi. From now on everything is what she told me because I have no memory even in how I got home. I ring the bell, she opened and I could barely talk and just said I drank one beer and a coke. Wanted to go to sleep and went to the bedroom. She got after me, didn't let me go into the bed and talked aggressively what's up with me. I laid into bed, she took my blanket, I got her blanked and covered me, she took it again away and in her opinion I got after her and hit her. After that I laid again in my bed, slept and the next thing what happened is that a police officer stand beside my bed and took me out of my flat. Thats how it all ended. I needed to go to the police department a few days later and saw a picture of her wrist where just a small red dot was showing (so in my opinion she, like always before attacked me and I defended myself) but to be honest I have no memory of everything that drives me crazy...  
Since then I gave up on myself. Went suicidal and browsed every possibility and realized there is no such way as 100% suicide method without being paralyzed, brain dead, or some other disability. I went to a psychiatrist - got diagnosed with major depressive disorder and got 2 antidepressants, quetiapine and xanax. I got off work for 2 months. I need to give up my flat because the last years it got much more expensive and I can't pay that rent in the future.. And all my neighbors saw police and ambulance here getting myself out of my flat. So, my life is pretty much ruined and I don't see a point of going on. I lost in my eyes a perfect match for me and didn't take that care she needed or deserved. I took her for granted and now I get what I deserve I think. I fucking need help to continue in my life. Since 1 month I lost 8kg body weight, took a shower 2 or 3 times only, can't even get up to brush my teeth, just sitting here smoking one cigarette after another.",1
"I KNOW THIS IS LONG BUT PLEASE READ IF YOU HAVE INSIGHT ON SLEEP ISSUES, PSYCH MEDS, AND MENTAL HEALTH/NEURODIVERGENCE 

Context:
I have ADHD, OCD, anxiety/depression, c-ptsd, and autism. Because of this, falling asleep and going back to sleep is hard because of racing thoughts, sensory issues, etc. 

I have been on 20+ psych meds, a lot of which have made issues worse for me. Some of ""masked"" my sleep issues which makes it harder to sleep off them, and some caused vivid/excessive dreaming. (more on this later*) This is what really started to fuel my sleep anxiety/fear. The only constant on that I've been on is Adderall (a few months ago I switched from IR to XR for my afternoon “booster”) 

More recently: 
A few weeks ago, I went off of Zyprexa (I have been on it and other similar drugs before but keep going off bc horrible side effects, but then start again bc I can’t fall asleep), quit THC completely, and started Buspar (3x daily). My life has been hell ever since. 

Over the past few weeks, my nights have looked like this: I have a ton of trouble falling asleep, but do eventually. Anywhere from a few minutes to an hour later, I’ll wake up. Then  I’ll like, kinda be asleep but feel awake and am having racing thoughts and anxiety in general the whole time. I start waking up over and over every few minutes and falling back “asleep” into this state until eventually I’m too anxious and I’m wide awake. 

I’ll often take a Xanax/Ativan (been prescribed them “as needed” for about a month and a half now) after and sometimes it helps, but it’s becoming less effective; I’m still anxious, and by the time I take it I’ve already suffered and still only get a few hours of sleep. I’ve taken them before bed and again sometimes it helps, but it’s not a good daily option, but my “as needed” keeps getting more frequent thought

I’ve tried OTC sleep meds but they haven’t worked for more than one night. So, about a week ago I started Hydroxyzine, and it makes me physically tired at first, but I still have the same problems as mentioned above. My body is doing everything in it’s power for me not to sleep. Since starting Hydroxyzine, my dreams have 100x longer/more vivid/more realistic too. 

*More on the dreams: These dreams felt/feel like they happen in real time and I’m not actually sleeping because of how vivid they are. I remember every single thing about them, just like they’re movies. They’re triggering, distressing, and exhausting. I wake up from them too. 

I’ve been doing all of the recommended “sleep hygiene” things (warm bath, listening to podcast/meditation, no social media before bed, etc.) but nothing seems to help. My brain is too loud and too powerful. My therapist feels hopeless/stuck, my psychiatrist feels hopeless/stuck, and I feel hopeless/stuck. 

I’m stuck in a cycle where I’m so anxious about sleeping that my body won’t sleep, not matter how tired it is, which just makes me more anxious. Every night is torture and it gets harder and harder to sleep every night.

I’m looking for any advice that could help me. I don’t know what to do and I’m so tired. I just want to be knocked out.",1
"I'm going thru the same things right now. A year ago I let them win and caused alot  self destruction to my body. 
I got so tired of fighting it that i buried myself in downers. 
I would wake-up pee get little drink if I was lucky or if I even cared never would eat. Unless I had to, to avoid passing out or getting dizzy. After I would lock my bedroom door and get my iv kit out and do shot after shot off any powerful opiate I had. And sleep all day long. 
For almost a year. When I ran out I was up for days and days til I got to the to the point of such an extreme exhaustion and maybe would be able to sleep for a few hours. I would detox so so bad. And the moment I got my money right and did whatever I had to do to get my fix I would continue. Always knowing that some day maybe a few this month, week or day ima run out. I kept running from so much. I won't explain. But ptsd from hell. I was diagnosed. Go to the point I didn't leave. Orngo to the doctors anymore. After a little while during the PUA I moved into my own place and had money and $ to support my habit to keep away the voices and thoughts.
One morning I got a call my grandpa had died. He was a Vietnam veteran. We were close before during my addiction. I had bought about 20-30 Xanax bars and I ate 6 and did a fat shot. About two days worth. A bout 1 week later or before. Keep in mind I'm living in a 2 bedroom home alone. 
Miles away from family. Somehow less than a week goes by and no body had heard from me I missed the funeral everyone was worried after that.  I don't remember a lot because I was literally hallucinating because I thought I had lost my min door and I saw someone pull in and it was my mom and my Grandma they were pounding on the door in the windows and yelling my name.  And I finally was able to roll out of bed and make it to the front door keep in mind I'm barely even crawling on all fours and hit the unlocked switch.  My mom and Grandma came in and said what is wrong with you what happened what's going on and I said I don't know I'm so shivering and sweating and I couldn't eat that I had eaten an enlightenment 56 days not even a bite of anything.  My mom begged me to go to the hospital I said I can't even stand up right now or do anything and I'm hallucinating I don't think she believed me.  So I beg her to let me go in the morning.  I ended up at the hospital and in an of the hospital getting 2 heart surgeries because I caught and I'll cart I just backed it back 2 times in a row I've had every valve of my heart replaced  They scanned my brain and I had 21 Mini strokes I also had full-blown sepsis and my kidneys it had a stroke forever ago so I was also being toxified by my kidneys not working.  I had a chance of survival at 22 or 25%.  And now I gotta hear clean and I'm doing my best I've gained so much weight I was 61 and I weighed maybe a 138 pounds  Haven't touched a drug since cause if I do no hospital in Ohio will do my surgery again it's like the baseball rose 3 strikes they won't do anything for valve placements.   But now everything is back or feels like it's turning into what I was running from again I've been fighting this  Very dreadful and mean Is feeling and the voices are back.  And I sit in my room by myself and argue with myself and maybe the voices And I sit in my room by myself and argue with myself and maybe the voices that are yelling in my head telling me to just f****** kill myself or just jump out of the f****** window hang myself.  There's a lot going on right now in my life also I have 11 year old son.  And I've tried so hard this year and a 1/2 to be in his life so much more I see him so much now but now there's a custody thing going on and I'm completely broke I'm not physically able to work in my disability case doesn't even go to court till December I just feel like you're complete f****** failure I tried to go to work Again since everything this wasn't only hard surgery I've had vascular surgery on both of my legs and under my left armpit so much s*** happevent but I'm trying not to overvent and tell every little detail anything you can imagine is happening to me but yet I'm still here somehow.  I remember a nurse walking into my room and looking me dead in the eyes and said why do you keep doing this and why do you do this if you know you're gonna get sick and it's gonna ruin your heart and your body and I said I'm just so tired of being your on this planet I'm so tired of dealing with what I meantal health which I didn't mention the voices or anything said I will never forget this That would be a horrible long way to die say there's faster ways in a smart a** voice as she walked out of my room in the hospital.  And then when people found out like staff wise that I was an adult and I was in there because of shooting up I was treated differently by a lot of people and people were very rude to me at times but there were  A lot of good doctors and nurses my doctor team was amazing I wouldn't be here if I didn't have them and they were very kind but still I don't think they would wanna honestly be me or could handle it I can handle anything I feel like mentally invisibly but at times it's too f****** much.  I just need help on who I should get a hold of.  I live in a very small town and there isn't a whole lot of mental help and even our doctors are  Very illiterate and didn't even know I had sepsis at all the other s*** I had to go clear up to Cleveland Ohio way up North to even get saved because they couldn't do anything but keep fluids in my body and give me some medications that was it.  I just need a recommendation on even like a mental health for like online or telephone or something  Anything that I can get mental help w.  And good mental help not once have I ever heard voices saying to her other people it's always been inward.  And I have a really big heart.  I've given so many people different chances and I feel like nobody wants to listen to me.  I send text messages I call and get rejected so then I have to send text and I have to constantly and constantly Explain what I'm trying to say and it's a f****** book just like this comment I'm leaving.  When a phone call would be so much easier.  I don't know what to do...",1
"Dizziness started in mid November 2021, went to Canberra on the 10th of December and I had my first near faint experience followed by high heart beat and palpitation. 

Dizziness and lightheaded was followed till the 28th of December when I nearly fainted again and had really high heart rate: went to hospital. They did blood work and ecg couldn’t find a probable cause. Went to hospital again 3 days later and no findings were evident. Upon my 3rd visit to hospital X-ray was done off my chest and nothing was found. I was bedridden for 6 weeks, everyday was a battle for life, I felt like I was in septic shock everyday. I had to get iv fluids about 10 times because of dehydration, I sweated constantly with no appetite for water or food.

Symptoms 

Lightheaded 
Dizziness
Heart gets tired quickly 
Sometimes my arms and hands become a little numb.
My head feels tension.
heat in my abdomen, back and my ears get hot.
Feels like a pulsating feeling through my body during a bad episode 
Sometimes left shoulder feels warm
My eyes sometimes drop tears randomly
Unable to concentrate at times
Shortness of breath during episode 
There’s always a tense feeling in my chest and around my heart area. Sometimes hits my lower abdomen and I feel nausea makes my stomach make noises. I have difficulty sleeping my head spins more when I close my eyes. I wake up between 1-3am with a weird feeling as if I’m scared or something. Vision sometimes becomes blurry. Fatigue and tiredness. Little sudden Noises scare me. Whenever I have a episode that peaks, my hands and feet get sweaty and I feel heat. My hands and feet sometimes get cold. The feeling in my mid left chest area I can’t explain but it’s as if my muscles are vibrating. When I stand up it’s seems my head and chest symptoms get worse for about a minute and then settle down. Same thing happens when I lay down. It gets worse for a minute till it goes back to how it was. Sometimes I can feel it hitting my front part of my head and my sinus feels tense as well. As well as my ears feel the pressure. Lying down seems to reduce some tension in my head. I feel bad 80% of the day really bad 15% of the day and alright 5% of the day.

Let’s go back to my childhood, my earliest memory is probably when I was around 10. If I would focus on my breathing it felt like I couldn’t breath anymore. I also had these unexplained spinning and dizziness at a young age during sleep time. Doctors couldn’t find anything. I was always a scared kid thinking about the worse case scenario that might kill me but in reality it was overthinking. In highschool a few times I nearly fainted out of the blue. Sometimes during sports I’ll hit a point where out of no where my heart would start racing and my breathing would become laboured. Sometimes over excitement caused this as well.

Now medications 

Lexapro 40mg for 6 months, no benefits. Made me really bad during the first 2 weeks and kinda of settled after that, dumbed the depressive symptoms but that’s about it. Felt much better after coming off, it definitely made my condition worse. Derealisation, fatigue, tiredness, forgetfulness. All of it.

Zoloft 50mg for 18 days and 100mg for 3 days, had a panic attack on day 3 I thought it was Zoloft but found it to be thc later on. Discontinued Zoloft then. No benefits during the 18 days on 50mg and made my condition way worse.

Paxil 20mg for 2 months, probably one of the strongest reactions to any ssri, daily panic attacks losing my mind, as if there’s a laughter in my head but it’s my internal monologue creating it but still I was losing it. Pushed on for 2 months and it just made me worse as the days went on.

Agomelatine 20mg no benefits, daily panic attacks, took it for about 36 days.

Pristiq, I’m on day 54 and I’ve stopped taking it, my last dose was on Wednesday not sure how to stop. It’s making me worse, mood is swinging, brain fog and all other symptoms are reappearing on this medication.

Clonidine didn’t do much except relax my body alittle

Lyrica, knocked me out at 25mg and made me tired. No benefits.

Valium 5mg, very small relief, short benefits 3-5 hours, more of a muscle relaxant, addictive in nature.

Clonezapam 1mg, small amount of relief, short relief 3-5 hours. 

Xanax 2mg, haven’t tried 

Ativan 1mg only have tried 0.5mg and it didn’t do much.

Seroquel 25mg, good for sleep, couldn’t sleep for more then 4 hours for the last 5 years or so, now I get a solid 8 hours, it’s not a 100% good quality sleep but it gets the job done, I don’t feel tired through the day as before I got sick.

Epilim haven’t tried chickenend out

Lamictal discontinued on day 3 after developing rash

Lithium 500mg, 37 days. Left like losing my mind not sure if adverse reaction to the lithium or it was some kind of discontinuation I was getting from the lexapro. 

Prozac 4 days to bridge off lexapro

Currently my biggest challenges are

I think I’m developing schizophrenia all the time, and I’m going to lose my mind.

I’m hyper vigilant and see things in the corners of my eye.

My physical symptoms cycle throughout the weeks and I’m never symptomsless. Physical or cognitive I always feel something.

My mind always feels like as if something is off,

As my overall condition gets worse my brain fogs becomes really bad and my hands and feet become so cold to the touch, 

I become very forgetful

I can never stop thinking about my condition, my mind is occupied by it 24/7

When I go into crowded areas my physical symptoms become much worse, such as brain fog heart rate and jelly legs.

My internal monologue never shuts up and it’s always active.

Racing thoughts

When I’m on medications l as ssri’s I get irrational fears such as being allergic to nuts or something crazy. But seems to go away after a month when discontinuing  the medication,

Lightheaded, feel like my neck muscles are so tense that my brain isn’t getting enough blood.

I’m hyper focused on all bodily functions physical or Cognitive, if I suspect something that is schizophrenic or damaging I get a mini panic attack. But panic attack do occur for no reason as well most of the times.",1

"What would you do in my situation out of curiosity and just to see how correct i am in thinking ive beyond ruined my life permanently. Im 18m ive been abusing weed and porn ever since 14 then became a bad kid at school even tho i was extremely gifted and smart i got high honors all freshman year 2019 until covid hit i became unmotivated and skipped all work ended up failing some classes because of it so then i just skipped all of 2/3rd the sophomore year playing video games bc we were all online learning until they forced me back in the last trimester and i skipped and didnt do shit then eventually i turned 16 i got a good job and started making good $ even tho i had never saved a dime and spent every paycheck every time on weed and dumb shit like vapes. then after sophomore year i got expelled because they found a pipe and ""shake"" in my car after doing a k9 run around all of the parking lot cars so then i worked full time and made a lot of $ for my age at the time being 16 i was working overtime and making 15 a hr so around 1200$ paychecks every 2 weeks me and a friend started ecstacy then that made us learn ab other drugs and then we became more and more cool with trying drugs and i ended up having my first seizure from a xanax binge and had it mid work shift not a good thing to happen at work so i got fired shortly after then i basically just drove illegally and worked dif jobs till 18 and got over 100 points on my license in wisconsin over 12 is suspended i had thousands of dollars in court tickets and fees i had my single mom pay for with what barely money she had and all my other family that would pay off my towing fees and other shit now im almost 18 and a half and i totaled my reliable and trustworthy toyota corolla getting a owi in the process and also getting my license revoked which is 1 year to lifetime i can never drive in wisconsin and i live 30 minutes from the nearest city with jobs madison wi i used the final paycheck i got before fired from my most recent job and got a somewhat decent car for 850$ and im about to move out of my shit county Columbia county and move to madison wi Dane county counties may seem the same but trust me the difference between these 2 is the difference between me being able to drive illegally and cops wont care vs me driving anywhere and the cops knowing my name and everything so they immediately pull me over and give me every ticket possible idk how ima get out of this hole i plan on just trying to get a job and living out of my car until i do any advice i know its a long very shittily wrote rant but any words or prayers mean the world to me gods the only thing keeping me alive atm love you all hope i can figure this out but my brain and body jus keeps saying no.",1
"let me start by saying that im chronically depressed, agoraphobic and dealing with some cptsd. i live in a terrible situation for my already mentally unstable self, but my problem is that i literally cannot get out of this situation because i have no energy.
im not talking about just not wanting to do things. i cant get out of bed. art was my life, my passion, my entire reason for living— i cant even draw anymore. i can hardly doodle. i havent made proper art in years and im literally losing my skills ive spent my entire life learning because im so god damn depressed i cant get out of bed. i can hardly even do that, i sleep so god damn much and the weak ass medication they keep giving me just isnt working.
i was homeless about two years ago, and my father was giving me some of his xanax to get me calmed down and it seemed to do the opposite almost. i had ENERGY for the first time since i was what, 10? and i wasn’t anxious. just stable. i dont fucking know.
im sick and tired of being tired im ROTTING and i dont feel real i just want to have ENERGY AGAIN. my life is falling apart and im falling apart with it and its not even worth screaming about. im being abused, im suffering so, so much but worst of all i have the energy of a corpse and all i can do is take it. 
even killing myself would take energy i dont have. its not even an option for me.
im so tired. im tired of waking up every morning and being essentially paralyzed. nothing matters, my health is declining and my teeth are rotting and my body hurts in ways i dont even have money to fix.
i want to kill myself, but theres no point even if i had the energy.
im so tired of masking myself as someone who has energy when i dont.
im so tired im TIRED. 
and nothing can ever make me have energy again.",1
"Nobody understands how I am feeling and I have been trying my best to describe it to every doctor and person I have come into contact with. I feel like my breathing has become manual - and is no longer automatic and unconscious. I feel like I have to breathe in and breathe out, on my own. 

I am leaving this as my final testament because no matter how many times I go to the ER, they dismiss me and tell me that I have anxiety. This is NOT a shortness of breath kind of feeling. I know what that feels like. Oddly, the only reprieve I seem to get from the feeling is if I drink alcohol or take a sedative like Xanax (obviously not together and at the same time!). 

When I take my vital signs they are all normal - oxygen is within normal range as well as HR and blood pressure. I can’t sleep at night due to this odd feeling/sensation. If you look at my chest, you will see that I am breathing. So obviously, I can still breathe on my own, automatically. It just FEELS  like I cannot.  It becomes increasingly worse and I get even more panicked when I concentrate and focus on it.  I can’t seem to break the cycle and all I can do is focus on it 24/7, regardless if they say that I am breathing automatically. It doesn’t reduce the anxiety and it only makes it worse when people tell me to calm down. 

I have decided that I have either: 
•encountered terrible brain damage from the dysautonomia or somehow the nerves stopped working in my brain to tell my diaphragm to breathe. However, I think the diaphragm MIGHT still be working because you can see the chest rise when I breathe.
• I have developed a neuromuscular condition that literally occurred out of the blue for no apparent reason. I was completely normal and fine before July 12th. And I have had maybe one day in-between then, that I have felt a brief period of normalcy (maybe a few hours). 

Going out of the house and doing things seems to help somewhat, although it is always in the background. The worst time with this is when I am trying to go to sleep at night. I can’t lay still, I am restless, I cannot fall asleep, because I am terrified of the sensation and I can’t relax to allow my body to take over. I have been taking Ativan at night to knock me out or at least give me a chance to close my eyes. For a long time, I was staying up for nights on end due to this sensation and fear of not being able to manually breathe if I fell asleep, and I also started feeling sick due to the lack of sleep. 

How would I know if I were getting a lack of oxygen to my brain if I wasn’t breathing enough? Would there be any signs or maybe just the sensation that I feel (then need to manually breathe)? 

If anyone has ever dealt with this before or can offer me some advice, besides seeing another doctor that will dismiss me, I would really appreciate it. Thank you for the help and support!",1
"TW Warning: Suicide

I am scared. I dealt with depression and anxiety since late last year (by dealt, medication) and I managed to taper off completely, by end March this year. 

It’s been going okay, with occasional mood swings and occasionally missing Xanax effects. But now, I am noticing the signs. I feel like I am headed back towards depression and I’m scared. It was a dark place. Im headed there again. I can feel it. I was about to end things in March, and I’m worried I’m headed there. 

Any suggestions? I’m scared",1

"I knew someone with severe agoraphobia. Constant anxiety and panic attacks, even when those close to him would leave the residence. Before he started Xanax, he was struggling. It was painful to see, but he was making slow progress. He was able to get mail, walk around the block of his apartment, and his family could leave without a problem. When he started Xanax, he became a different person. He was so dependent on it that he wouldn’t even leave his room, and would take it for any spike in anxiety. It reached the point where his family couldn’t leave, or I couldn’t leave the house, without him threatening to take more or killing himself. It later worsened his anxiety because he felt if he didn’t take it he was immediately in withdrawal and was going to have a grand mal seizure. I know it’s hard, and I know you said you never abused it, but it can be a slippery slope. Just be careful :) I feel for you in the sense that I lived with someone through similar pain, and it was hard.",1

"Hi,

I am a 23F with severe anxiety and panic disorder. I have been suffering since May trying to get rid of it medication-free, but I am not sure if I can anymore. I recently got prescribed Xanax (.25mg a day, take 2x a day as needed). I want to try it, however, I am afraid of 1) the side effects and 2) the dependency. My anxiety is severe and I will most likely need to take it every day. I do not want to become addicted to it. I also have never taken meds before so I am new to all of this.

I am very afraid to take meds due to the side effects. I do not want it to affect my heart or heartbeat. I already have heart palpitations due to severe anxiety. I have been checked by doctors and cardiologists and they have said I am fine. Sometimes though when I am feeling anxious my heart will beat weirdly - It'll beat fast then for 1 or two beats it'll be slow then it'll speed up again. I know my cardiologist said I am fine but still. I am worried that the medicine will impact my heart rate or palpitations and that I will become addicted to it since my anxiety is so severe and I will probably need it every day. If anybody has taken Xanax, please let me know of your experiences. ",1

I was able to comfortably smoke and not worry. Either way, I have a slightly stiff chest now. I had been doing push-ups and curls and didn’t stretch. Am I panicking?

"Guys, I’ve been dealing with C-Ptsd for three years. I was at my lowest point in life shortly after turning 25 years old in 2022. Moved, and sorta took a year and a half to get myself together (was on Zoloft for a year which was a journey in itself and successfully weened off and I was doing quite good) I was doing quite well. Off medication for four months and regulated. 

Long story short, someone I know told me about Xanax and how it knocks him out on flights etc. I’ve heard about the infamous drug here and there through movies and tv shows blah blah. Ofc, I still have my bad days because I’m still human and the C-PTSD as yall know, doesn’t go away completely.

So I took it, felt super good. I took .25mg at a time, I took it for three consecutive days. And then took a break, did some research about Xanax and benzos. I was like uh-oh. I gotta chill and lay off this stuff for a bit. But then I was in a bad mood cuz I was already getting kind of dependent on it already, and I couldn’t sleep. So I took another .25mg dose. Waited for a few days and then took another .25mg when I felt like I was feeling bad.

And then for about ten days I’ve been feeling TERRIBLE. ANGRY, rage, it’s like I’ve gone back to my old crazy era when I was 25 years old.

I haven’t taken any since and I can’t allow myself to take it. I cant label this as a ‘relationship’ because this interaction between Xanax and I’ve been too short like 2 weeks.

Is this normal? Is it because of Xanax I feel so angry and depressed, can’t sleep? I haven’t felt this way since 2 years ago I mentioned. Will this feeling go away? 

Help???",1

"Hey all.

I know this is a huge community and there's almost no one reading my posts, but if this post can help one person decide, I want to share.

So I've been on PRN ativan for over 4 years now, 8 put of 10 times, it does wonders for me. Since my anxiety has been worse the last few months, and I am also working on it with a new therapist, I asked my psychiatrist to try something new, so switched to xanex.

Xanex works, but it works differently. Xanax takes the edge off, but ativan gives you more of a calm feeling when it hits its peak. I feel like for me ativan is the better of the 2 options.

Anyway, thanks for listening ",1
"I got new psychiatrist in past few years 

He lowered my dose 

I never abused it 

When I was on 30 monthly I’d have extra left. 

I suffer from chest pain and hyperventilation for no reason out of the blue when I take it it helps. I don’t even pass out for fall asleep. I can talk and function fine. 

New doctor puts me on 10 pills a month past several years now. I still suffer from these attacks now and then, but it’s more than 10 a month. I avoid taking it because of fear of running out. 

He doesn’t want me dependent on it, of course, it’s a very addictive drug.

I’ve been responsible with my use & I take as needed. 

I try to tell him but he still refuses. 

I’ve been in CBT & DBT for years now and know the tools. I’m very rational and aware yet my physical symptoms still persist nevertheless.

Before even being prescribed this I suffered from bouts of panic often. I couldn’t function in high school or college. Still graduated though, would escape to the bathroom to calm down same at my job. Struggled immensely, it would take me several minutes to up/+ than an hour. 

I have constant chest pain but don’t take Xanax until it’s full blown feeling like I’m legitimately going to die. 

Anyways, I’m not sure what to do. Xanax saved my life and I can function now in certain situations and be prepared. The 10 dose count now (basically 2.5mg a month) really got me messed up. I do take as needed, but if I do then I’ll run out. I’ve been like this for over a decade now. 

He says he doesn’t want me dependent on Xanax, but I am in amphetamines for ADHD (10 & 20MG, daily …) & lamictal for stabilizing my moods for bipolar 1. 

I am dependent on those, I don’t take them or forget (I lost them during travel once) then I start end up feeling suicidal and very self destructive. Losing my mind. I haven’t been taking my ADHD meds and it’s hard to do anything at all. Very productive on it and feel like a normal functioning adult in society. 

Still the panic and fear doesn’t go away. It sucks. I can handle it I’m used to it my life. It’s just extremely painful, it’s not a cure, more so a band aid. Which I genuinely don’t abuse. I’m not sure how to bring this up. I’ve tried so many times. When I used to be on 30 a month like I said earlier, I’d still have a few left. 

He tried to put me on Paxil & doxepin as well. Too much side effects. 

I appreciate any input. Currently on 1mg right now, felt like I was having a heart attack earlier. 

Very weird how it just makes me feel like I can be a stoic calm person. Too bad I worry about running out. 

Thanks anyone who reads this and can give advice or input. 

I do practice CBT & DBT skills and tools I learned, practice healthy diet & such. 

Note: I have C-PTSD, Bipolar 1, ADHD, GAD, Panic Disorder. Experienced much CSA, SA, violence and such. It is what it is. I can be outwardly stoic but my nervous system inside feels like it’s killing me. 

Medication isn’t the cure it’s a band aid, I know.

"To preface, I am prescribed Xanax through my psychiatrist. I am taking it legally and as prescribed. Also I never ever drive with Xanax in my system, someone else will be driving me.

Some background, I have agoraphobia strongly linked to extreme emetophobia. I’ve been taking Xanax infrequently for about two years to get out of the house for health apportionments, family events, and exposure therapy. I absolutely could not even leave the driveway without it. I take 1mg to go out, wait an hour for it to take effect, and usually get about 4 hours out with it.

About 4 months ago I had a really bad panic attack at home one night (unrelated to Xanax) and ever since my anxiety has been bad at home and especially at night. I’ve been taking .5mg on the worst nights but typically .25mg if I need it, take the least amount that will still work y’know? It was so bad at first that I was taking .5mg most nights but it’s gotten a lot better lately and I’ve only been taking .25mg once or twice a week. All of this I’ve discussed with my therapist and psychiatrist and they’re both okay with me taking it like that. 

Also have discussed fear of addiction with them and they both agree that I am not addicted and they don’t fear me getting addicted from the way I’m currently taking it.

So my current predicament is my sister’s wedding is in two days and the rehearsal is tomorrow. Thankfully it’s only 15 minutes from home and is a place I’m very familiar with so that helps with a bit of the worry. However I also haven’t been there or been that way in years so I’m still pretty anxious about it.

I need to be at the church hours before the rehearsal to help my family decorate. I also need to be at the church hours before the ceremony begins as I am the maid of honor and we have to take lots of photos before the ceremony. I foresee myself having to be out for around 8 hours both days and, as I said previously, I only get about 4 hours out of 1mg. If I’m being generous, I won’t be surprised if I have to take at least 2mg, maybe even 2.5mg, throughout each day. My anxiety and agoraphobia are extreme enough that being out, and especially being in a car, without Xanax is impossible and non negotiable. Especially with the incredibly nerve wracking situation I’ll be in on the wedding day, I’m gonna need every bit of my medicine. Uncomfortable dress that’s kinda tight on my stomach (I hate that), possible makeup (also hate how that feels), lots of standing (I have dysautonomia), lots of interaction with and being perceived by people I don’t know or don’t see much, and I probably won’t be able to eat much for fear of getting sick.

So my worry is that taking that much Xanax two days in a row as well as having been taking it more frequently than usual lately will cause it not to work as well on the wedding day. I cannot afford to have it not in my system and doing its thing perfectly on that day. I’m also quite worried about being out later than I’d like and having to drive home as it’s getting dark because, as I mentioned, my anxiety is much worse as it gets dark. I’m worried that as the day goes on and my body works the Xanax out of its system I won’t be able to get home. I’ve been taking Xanax long enough to know how much I’ll likely need and how to take it properly but I’ve never taken this much this close together so I’m not sure what to expect.

Can anyone who has experience taking a higher amount of Xanax at once tell me if I have anything to worry about? I will also add that I’m only 91 pounds (I know I’m underweight, I’m working on it) in case body weight factors into your opinion of Xanax’s effectiveness.",1
The Prozac is helping my anxiety a bit but now I’m left with my full blown depression. I didn’t take my Xanax because I wasn’t having a panic attack. I don’t want to use it either for my severe depression because I’m afraid if I use it for that I’ll get addicted. But I’m crying non stop it’s really bad,1
I’m supposed to take a flight tomorrow morning with my daughter. It’s 4 and a half hours. I’m so terrified that I’m going to have a horrible anxiety attack and will freak out causing them to land the plane. I recently started new meds ( see my old posts) but I feel like it might have been making my paranoia worse. I felt like I was drugged and out of it. I also started waking up with a high heart rate. I didn’t take my dose last night and I’ve only taken 3 total of the Abilify. My mom has Xanax but I have horrible health anxiety and I’m terrified I’ll have a bad reaction. It’s just me and my 8 year old daughter. I would rather cancel then put her in danger. I’d take a very small fraction (less than 1mg). I’ve read both good and bad reviews on here. This would be a 2 time thing. Just for the flight and back. I also have POTS which makes me react weird to meds. Someone please reassure me as this is my last resort. ,1
Todays I mixed gabapentin and Xanax. I was thinking I just had a killer migraine and needed to sleep but when I woke up I felt so so weird and out of it for hours and I really online that the two mixed together can cause overdose is that likely? ,1
"I was put on Xanax by a psychiatrist 13 years ago.  I have never been able to get off of it. In Feb., after being hospitalized for my anxiety and what I was told for years was bipolar, I was assigned to a new Dr who reevaluated me and found out I never had bipolar but I am ADHD with anxiety. They changed my meds and I feel great. Now we have decided I no longer need the Xanax. I was originally prescribed 1mg 3x a day. I was taking that dose for years. I’ve been trying to wean since June 1st. My Dr is helping me. We are decreasing the dose .25 mg every 2 or 3 weeks. So now I am down to 1.75 but I feel like the withdrawals are getting worse with hot flashes, nausea, diarrhea, cloudy foggy head, increased anxiety . Is it normal to feel these withdrawals still even by withdrawing just .25 mg at a time? This drug is the devil. I can totally see why people can’t get off this. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I’m struggling",1
When I take 0.25 mg of xanax the following few days I feel strange in my head and lightheaded with increased anxiety.  Anyone ever experienced this? ,1
"Hi guys, I’m wondering if anyone out there has had success with herbal remedies for anxiety? I’ve been rationing my Xanax prescription for the last 6 months but I’m almost out. I’d love to know what has worked for you guys. No 🌿💨please, as I’m allergic. Thanks! ",1
"I recently had a really bad panic attack that lasted hours. Went to my normal doctor and she gave me a weeks worth of Xanax at .25 mg. I feel as tho it is not calming me down. I am supposed to go back to college in a few days, I left durning panic attack on train home. I’m scared that this Xanax willl not help me when I’m having a bad panic attack again. ",1
"So from the beginning I had been prescribed prozac, it's working pretty good, but it still hasn't been 4 weeks (might even take 6) so that is supposed to help me with anxiety in general, and my depression etc 


A few days ago i got the racing heart beat, chest pain, loss of breath I get without even noticing, I talked to him about this, and told him that luckily this doesn't happen very often, he said it's the begging of a panic attack, that just doesn't escalate further 

So, the prozac he said will help with this, but, he prescribed me 0.5 Xanax for moments like that. He said he's not gonna prescribe me more for all of 2025 (the pack has 30 pills inside)he wants me to use it only when needed, I gave the pills to my mom, so that there's more control, I have one pill in my pocket, the rest is hidden 


So im thinking, when do I use this? For those near panic attack moments? Or could I use this before meeting someone new for example (I have severe social anxiety) ? I guess I should listen to my doctor and use it when I have those moments, but I get extremely anxious in a couple of other situations, not often, but yeah social related things especially ",1
"Currently on buspar, and Xanax for almost two years, and just got prescribed remeron for anxiety and depression and extreme panic disorder. I'm not going to go into major detail but as I cannot ask a medical professional and my psychiatrist didn't mention any drug interactions when prescribing it but online I read that both drugs can cause interactions. I'm so anxiety ridden and paranoid I don't want to take it is anyone else on this combo ",1
"i’ve been diagnosed with ocd, ptsd, anxiety, depression, bpd and my doctor prescribed me xanax, .25 mg 3x a day. i just take two in the morning because it lasts all day and i’m a veterinarian nurse and don’t have time to take the second dose halfway through the day and by the time i get off i just go to bed but i went down a whole rabbit hole about how it’s so horrible long term and the withdrawal is excruciating and that you’re not supposed to be on it for more than four months. it’s helped me so much and my doctor is prescribing it to me long term but now i’m on the brink of a breakdown reading all these things. i’m so scared. what do i do? should i ask to get off of it? even though it’s helped me so much?

"Hello, I’ve been suffering from generalized anxiety my whole life I’m 26 I have two kids and in 2018 my dad died in a very tragic and it was completely unexpected. I’ve been suffering from severe ptsd ever since I cannot handle my kids getting sick or having any “health problems” (Normal routine doctor visits\shots\eye exams) I am terrified of doctors and doctor offices in general. I believe my doctor is wanting to try prescribing me Xanax for the panic attacks. I am afraid it will effect my ability to be an aware parent. Can any parents let me know if it made them have issues or anything that can help me make this decision. Thank you. ",1
I have severe flight anxiety and have rx for 1 mg Xanax on shorter flights and 1 mg klonopin for long flight. I’m going on an international trip next week and my doc suggested I take the Xanax for 1.5 hour flight first. I then have an about a 5 hour layover and to then take a klonopin. By the time I would take the klonopin it would have been about 6.5-7 hours from when I took the Xanax. Thoughts on this? I know my doc said it’s fine but google is giving me more anxiety about it. Any input is appreciated. ,1
"Hello all and thank you for any help/advice. Now I know the answer to my question should be absolutely not do not even consider taking benzos again, but hear me out. Years ago I was abusing Xanax off the street (so analogs and fent) I had 3-4 seizures in a two year span trying to get off them myself. That was over 5 years ago. I’ve always struggled with crippling anxiety which is why I began abusing Xanax in the first place. I’m clean now. Just smoke weed sometimes. I’ve recently gotten a psychiatrist who on the first meeting wanted to prescribe Xanax which I immediately turned down. She then offered klonopin which I said no to as well. She prescribed me Buspar, I’ve taken it and not noticed much of a difference in my anxiety attacks. This is the 2nd or 3rd medication I’ve tried for my anxiety that isn’t an benzo that doesn’t seem to be effective. I’m not craving that “high”anymore. I just need to be able to control my anxiety a few times a month for flights, Job meeting/interviews, etc… so my question is, if I were to start taking small doses of klonopin maybe a 5 times a month, would I need to be worried about having more seizures? I’ve read that you’re more susceptible to benzo withdrawal symptoms if you’ve experienced them before and don’t know how accurate this is. I’m just desperate for some relief from this feeling. I’m not too worried about becoming addicted again. I’ve overcome that part of my life, just more the physical withdrawals that could come. Thank you for any and all advice. ",1
"I’m 26f. I take Xanax ONLY when I feel a serious panic attack coming on. I have an irrational fear of pharmaceuticals, and I am deeply afraid of becoming dependent on them, so I only take them when I feel no other way out. For years, they have saved me. They’d pull me out of even my worst panic attacks. But recently, it just isn’t anymore. I had taken a Xanax Bc I felt a panic attack coming on, but it persisted entirely and was THE WORST one I’ve had to date. Extremely hot and cold, hands turning scarily white and total paralysis from the wrist up, tunnel vision, couldn’t walk. I ended up being rushed to the ER even after some firefighters checked me out. It hit me in waves and wouldn’t stop. The ER told me it was a panic attack, gave me a ton of Ativan and something called atarax (?) and I eventually stopped and was discharged. Now, my panic seems to always persist through my Xanax, and I CANNOT fathom upping my doses or frequency, I WILL NOT become addicted. Is my anxiety getting even stronger? I can’t live the rest of my life this way, will I have to be fucking sedated or tranquilized to stop my panic attacks? This is fucking ruining my life. AND, there is NO REASON for them! I used to have some specific triggers, but now it just happens whenever it damn well feels like it. PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!! I CANT LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE LIKE THIS!!!",1
Not sure if this is the right place to ask but figured I’d give it a try. I’ve taken Xanax as needed for years. I go through odd phases in life when I have very bad panic attacks. My doctor wants me to try Effexor as a long term solution. I have medication anxiety as well where I get nervous to take medication. Xanax helps immensely with my panic attacks. I’ve read that Effexor when first starting out can cause panic attacks and it really works well for people who stick it out and take it. Has anyone had any experience with this and would my Xanax still do it’s magic and help with this if that happens to be one of the starting side effects I experience. ,1
"As the title says. I was originally prescribed Valium as a safety blanket med, which did nothing but make me more irritable. My doctor then switched to Xanax 0.5 mg which also did nothing, and later to 1 mg, which again did nothing (as we speak, I'm currently going through a very bad interaction with Xanax and Vraylar). Is there anything that any of y'all take when the previous two don't work? We are trying to get me on a regular medicine (Buspar), but I'm about to give up on that one because the side effects are way too strong, and I feel nothing positive from it. ",1
"hi everyone. I was just prescribed .25mg of xanax for my panic attacks. I am a wee bit nervous to take it, for reference I am a 26 F, 5’2 138 lbs. I was prescribed lexapro too and started to take that and had a horrible horrible reaction so I stopped. I am a bit scared when it comes to taking new meds and the lexapro proved just that. Should I start by taking half a dose of Xanax (when needed) or is .25mg that low of a dose where it wont really impair my ability to function? I’m worried about the side effects and would love to hear some positive stories on how you guys feel after taking it. thanks in advance and be well. ",1
"Hi, I am going for a long trip tommorrow and want to make sure that I will have a good night sleep (unfortunatelly I often have a sleep problems when im nervous). Can I take xanax 0,5mg let’s say about 8PM and then at 10PM mianserin 10mg? Is there any bad interaction between these meds besides increasing drowsiness and sedative effects which are welcome in my case? Thank you in advance. ",1
"I suffered from depression and severe anxiety for two years. It had specific causes and after the first 7 months, when some of the root issues were more or less resolved, it became a bit more bearable. I was given Xanax (0,5 mg), at first 3 times a day and after a while 2 pills (0,5 mg) 3 times a day. I also took a variety of herbal supplements like Valerian and St. John's wort. The medication didn't work. I was in an almost constant state of anxiety and I still had periods of depression. After 2 years I quit cold turkey, as I was travelling to a country which did not allow me to bring in medication. There were no side effects, physical or mental. The constant anxiety was gone. Nothing changed in my life, but I suddenly was the old me again. At first I was afraid it wouldn't last, but it's been 5 years now. My therapist was surprised that I was able to quit cold turkey with no side effects. I'm wondering if I have some sort of resisteance to Xanax and such like drugs. Last year I underwent a gynecological procedure and was given full anaesthesia. While I did not feel any pain, I also did not fall asleep, to the great surprise of the doctors. ",1
"My partner uses Xanax daily (about 0.5 mg) and drinks alcohol. He has been doing this for about a year. He says he wants to stop taking the benzos, but unfortunately, it's been very hard. Has anyone here had a similar experience and managed to stop taking benzos? ",1
"will i get addicted to xanax (0.25 mg) if i take it for two days, then stop for 2 weeks and take it again for one day? i have some presentations and suffer from anxiety but i am so scared of becoming addicted. ",1
"I got prescribed .25 mg of xanax for panic attacks  and I took it today for the first time and I was wondering if it’s normal to feel like tingling, then like random pain. Maybe the pain wasn’t from the medicine but I had pain in my jaw and then my neck. I also felt like it didn’t really do anything to help? I’m scared to take a bigger dose since I felt so weird when I took it. I don’t know lol I took Ativan before this so I’m wondering if maybe I just have like a tolerance to benzos? 
I guess I just want someone to tell me if my reaction to it was normal or not. I don’t want to be scared of taking it ",1
My job stresses me out very very very badly. It pays really well but I just fear I got in way way over my head and I also just took on so much more responsibility. Every morning that I log on I go into fight or flight and I am crying every day. The only way I feel better when I’m having these serious anxiety days is my Xanax but I am only prescribed 0.25 mg. I am prescribed this much just as a crutch for emergencies but recently have been taking them more often. I do NOT want to be dependent on benzos/medication (I’ve tried all the lexapros/effexors/etc). But I just feel like my anxiety levels in these past months are through the roof. I can’t really quit my job because it pays really well and I know no where else is going to pay me what this company does. Does anyone take anything that helps them get through the day that isn’t a prescription? I just feel helpless lol ,1
"Been in a 2-week depressive state that has flipped my sleep schedule on its head (sleeping more during the day than at night). Been taking .5 mgs of Xanax in the morning (3 days so far) to take the edge off for the day, which seems to work. Is it ok to take 50 mg of hydroxyzine at night to help me fall asleep asleep as well?

I’ve just heard all the horror stories about Xanax and benzodiazepines in general",1
I’ve been on Xanax .5mg for about 9-10 weeks. Taking one per day. Last 5 days I went down to .25. Last night I didn’t take any. Should I taper off more or just stop since I didn’t take one last night ? I did reach out to MD but haven’t hear t anything back yet. ,1
I have been taking 0.25 mg of xanax once a day for a little over a month. Maybe once a week I double the dose but no more than once. I am trying to take the 0.25 mg once every other day now and I am wondering if it will cause withdrawal symptoms? ,1
"28yo Male. I have crippling panic disorder and for the last 3 months I’ve been taking Prozac with 1,5mg of Xanax. The reason I added Xanax is that my attacks were literally crippling to the point that I was screaming for my life…so until the Prozac started to kick in, I had to do what I had to do. The problem is that I’ve been tapering off Xanax extremely slowly for the past month or so and I still got a bad withdrawal episode where I almost got a seizure. The reason I say this is because I got the first stage (aura) where I had awful explosions of horrible Ammonia smells in my brain (phantom smells along dizziness) that would come every 2 minutes or so. And it lasted hours. As a side note I know my brain is healthy no tumours and stuff cause I had an MRI done 2 months ago and it was perfect. I’m pretty sure my brain is flirting with seizures that just don’t progress… be very careful before you take this medication PLEASE consider your alternatives first. Now I was advised to go back on it and taper even more slowly. It sucks. Please get a second opinion if your doc proposes Xanax. ",1
"# urgent. 

# Been using two bars over last week and a valium few days ago and yesterday, today I felt confused and began experecing concerning health issues, dizziness, anxiety etc. in congruence with the rebound syndrome. I used to have a mild problem with these so naturally im terrified of them, but also liked breifly how they made me feel.

# Concerning.

#  Would short usage like this be a cause for concern? I mean short use you wouldn't have to wean off benzos with (less) benzos, right? The only thing I have left is like 2mg of valium, I was feeling anxious earlier so I am dissolving it under my tounge, but no more.

# Surely all I am experiencing is godawful rebound anxiety without panic, correct? 1-4 days? Would strongly appreciate some advice, help.

In the morning should I also potentially ask my doc for a single sleeping tablet or benzo if I really need it.

This shit is the devil if you used more than like a single pill per, well, when you really really need it.",1
"So I (17F) have been struggling with really bad anxiety for a few years and I had a horrible month in February so we finally decided to contact a psychiatrist. He prescribed me 0.125mg Xanax three times a day (splitting a 0.25mg pill in half). It’s the lowest possible amount but it has genuinely helped me massively. Before this I was getting anxiety sick for days if not weeks at a time which was preventing me from going to school and just functioning like a normal person. 

However, back in February I also got put on a waiting list for an adolescent mental health service and I was recently able to start getting appointments. This organisation is made up of all sorts of mental health specialists including psychiatrists, and after the second appointment they basically made me a plan to stop taking my Xanax, starting next week, because they don’t think I should be on it especially since I’m a minor. Honestly I am devastated because for the first time in a long time I was able to function like a normal person and I don’t want that taken away from me. And right now is actually a pretty horrible time to stop because I have more reasons than usual to be anxious: my boyfriend of 3 years is moving countries next week, my mom is sick, my sister recently recovered from the worst case of mono I have ever seen and I’m absolutely TERRIFIED to get it as well and I just finished school but the exam stress always stays with me for a while after for some reason. And obviously I’m very anxious about stopping them. I’m just really scared that I’m going to start getting constantly sick and missing a bunch of school again, especially since in September I’m going to start my final year of school and my exam results dictate what course I get into and in which college, so if I am constantly sick my chances of getting what I want will basically be ruined. 

They did suggest switching to antidepressants but those have so many more side effects that last for weeks and I am really scared of them. I don’t know what the point of this post is, I guess I just kind of want somebody to tell me that I will be fine. This mental health service place will also be giving me therapy sessions, but I’ve had three therapists before and none of them have done much so I don’t feel very hopeful. I’m just really sad and scared. I’m not ready for this at all but they said it’s concerning that I’ve been on them for 3 months and that I need to stop them as soon as possible. 

I’ve also been having some sleep problems for the past few years, which Xanax also helped with and honestly getting no sleep is one of the things I’m really scared of because sometimes I can’t sleep for DAYS, it’s horrible.

Honestly any advice or reassurance would be appreciated because I’m at a loss and I feel so hopeless and scared.

"GAD and mood swings.

Suffering from anxiety, panic attacks and paranoia since 7th grade, before 2021 I didn’t knew how it was called to describe what I felt inside and just told parents that I’m nervous. Parents did nothing for my anxiety and my fucking paranoia. So got through “trying many drug myself phase” and stopped. Figured out that Xanax is piece of shit for me when I had fucking panic attacks after quitting it and didn’t worked well for me.  I thought it was cool before my friend gave me Pregabalin and gabapentin - did absolute magic for me. I felt real, felt alive, felt like a normal person. So I stopped on 2 tries of each pill and took several months break.

Went to new doctor with my gf and we hoped that this one will give me real meds for me which will help for my main problem - anxiety and paranoia what were before my drug use. Main thing in here. So 
Doctor says it’s addictive and bad for you. Went through many psychiatrists and through mental hospital Tried many ssri’s. None worked for anxiety even paroxetine. Antipsychotics which never worked for my anxiety. And anticonvulsants like trileptal and lamictal.

Only trileptal worked for my aggression and did stabilised my mood
But still I have anxiety and paranoia.
So doctor  prescribed me mirtazapine for it.

1 month with mirt feeling great and sleeping great but fuck…. Paranoia.

Since 7th grade…
Still thinking that everybody laughing at me, looking at me, discussing something about me, everyone wanna rob me fight me and you know etc.

But! 
Only on fucking GABAPENTIN or PREGABALIN this shit was fully gone
Finally I felt like I should feel. I felt like I’m part of society, not like I’m somewhere outside. Anxiety was gone, strange thoughts, aggressive thoughts, paranoia and shit is finally gone.

And…. fuck, doctors saying no bro drink antipsychotics. Non worked, everything was there on any of them and I fucking hate it they don’t want to prescribe me a fucking more stronger anticonvulsant mood stabiliser and anxiety relief medicine because I can become addicted. So my friend told me to check paid private psychiatrist only he can listen and know that antipsychotic will not help me.

I know there’s many people with same situation here. Or people like my friends who has these meds prescribed and everything is wonderful for years. I just want to stop feeling shitty all day because of fucking panic and paranoia when I go out from my house. Help….",1
"Would taking 2mg (total, not at once) of xanax a week for a month put me at a real risk of dependency? If I was to space their use out at least 2-4 days would that make a difference? Apparently it's half life average is 11 hours on average so about 2 days should have it cleared from your body, and I figure if I always wait for the last dosage to clear out before taking another I shouldn't be at much risk for tolerance building/dependency.

Looking for any input or education on the matter, thank you ",1
"I have been prescribed xanax for a year or so, Ativan I found didn't work for me unless I took 3 0.5mg pills and it still wouldn't calm me down. I only ever took that much every few months and wpuld try to stick to 1 or 2 if the anxiety was at its absolute worst.

I am on xanax now, aside from two incidents (one last month where I took 5 0.5mg, like 6 months ago I took 3). I am trying to do the same thing (aside from these weird reckless lapses I have) where I take it only at my worst anxiety levels. It almost never has an affect that actually helps me calm down from a panic attack, even when i use it extremely intermittently, and I am worried this will be the case with all benzos. Am I doing something wrong? I try really hard myself but it never seems to work. ",1
"i‘ll take my first dose of xanax tomorrow (0.25mg) because i have a presentation and i‘m extremely nervous during this kinda stuff (sweating, racing heart, constant panic, u know the drill). i‘m kinda scared to take it bc i‘ve heard it makes u sleepy and i‘ll take it in the morning also i‘m afraid of brain fog/ seeming high… help pls ",1
Xanax actually helped me a lot with all my health issues been on it for over 3 years daily. It’s not something I want to be on I’ve never ever taken it prior to 3 years ago. But it’s the only thing that helps with my problems along with the lunesta I take to sleep. Even tho .25 is the lowest dose you still can and will have withdrawals from it but it’s not as life threatening as it would be if you was doing a higher amount. I started off taking 2mg in the beginning but I’m down to .25,1
"i was on xanax for a couple months back in 2020(?). it went great for a little bit. wasn’t anxious about my shitty job at the time, honestly just didn’t have a care in the world. 

after a couple months i noticed my depression began to decline. it declined so bad, i ended up in the mental hospital and haven’t taken xanax since. 

it definitely works for some people, and if you find it helps, more power to you! i would just advise that if you struggle with depression as well, there is a chance xanax might make it way worse. whatever you decide, i hope it works for you! stay safe!",1
"I'm on alprazolam .5mg also for severe chest pains. I've been on it for 3 years but I rarely take it. Only as needed. The only problem I've had is being sluggish the next day for a few hours, I drink coffee to perk up but it works well for me",1
Xanax is very helpful when needed but the risk is not worth reward. Xanax is highly addictive and getting off of it is the worst w/d out there imo,1
"for some reason i love it, it’s the only thing that takes the edge off crap and the only thing that calms me down, though i also enjoy lorazepam",1

I've used buspar and it helped very well, but caused a lot of issues with insulin sensitivity, high blood sugar, difficulty controlling myself around food (I'm a type 1 diabetic, so this added way more stress than just trying to manage my every day anxiety without medication). 

Has anyone else noticed that Xanax messes with GI system? The day after I take even that low low dose, I have the shits and am very uncomfortable.",1
Can you elaborate on this “upregulation”,1
"I hope you mean 10mg lexapro, because 10mg Xanax will make you into a time traveler and potentially a criminal lol. I’m a little confused because Lexapro isn’t a drug that works as needed",1
You took every day 0.5mg for months and didn't have any withdrawal symptoms? Damn,1
Buspar doesn't do shit,1
"I agree with this poster, I was on it 5 years I went from 0.25 to 6mg because the tolerance would go up so quickly and the half life is short so you start to withdraw really quick which gives you rebound anxiety - coming off I was sick for nearly a year and my anxiety was the highest it ever was 


If a doctor puts you on a benzo there is longer lasting ones like valium who have a really long half life - Xanax is meant for things that last like a few days to 2 weeks but I would not suggest getting on them",1
"Take magnesium and gaba, fuck the benzos",1
"OP, Reddit is full of xanax nay sayers. Take the comments with a pinch of salt",1
I take Xanax before I go to work and it’s amazing. Otherwise I don’t think I could work,1
Homie. Benzos are a bandaid. You'd be way better off taking Prozac or something. If you take that long term you wont have any memories,1
I have so much empathy for people who truly need it and do not abuse it…it’s just simply not fair. I’m grateful that I have a great psychiatrist and therapist,1
You misunderstood me then. I don’t have panic attacks daily. I can go 6+ months with out one. “I have gone up and down as many have and during my downtime Xanax has been the most helpful” did you even read it or are you just using it make your own assumptions,1
"Alcohol doesn’t do a thing for me,  benzodiazepines do",1

"I’ve been on benzos since I was 16, I’m 38 now. I’m on other meds as well. My anxiety is very very obvious. I get them prescribed by my gp now, it used to be my psychiatrist. Just seeing me off meds makes my anxiety very clear, like I don’t even have to really say anything",1
"It's almost identical in its addictive properties, it's just the hangover that mostly prevents people from continuous use",1
"did buspar help at all? i’m on it now, and also have klonopin for as needed. ik everyone is different and what didn’t work for you might work for me but im really tired of this constant anxiety and feeling that im going to die soon",1
Yeah medically induced coma in Russia I believe,1
"alcohol is worse, but please continue spouting nonsense",1
"Xanax is not a long acting benzo, in fact the reason Xanax is so problematic and highly addictive is specifically for that reason. It has a rapid onset and offset of action",1
Dependence isn’t addiction,1
"It gave me extreme night sweats! I’m talking it looked like a body outline. It seemed to mellow me out a bit anxiety wise, but still had panic. I eventually came off bc i couldn’t deal with the sweating",1
Weed definitely works wonders in the moment,1
"Having your anxiety return when you stop taking benzos IS a sign of dependency.  That’s the whole concern.  And when the anxiety returns it’s often far worse than it was before.  Which causes people to think that benzos are the only thing that works for them. 

What you are describing is textbook benzo dependency.  2 or 3/day for 13 years is an addiction.  It might not be ramping up, but the long term side effects are not good for you.",1
are your panic attacks like an all day thing? cause i really need a solution to this,1
"its also relative, my mom used to get heavy on the valium and could go off it no problem besides usual stress, but thats a lot longer half life",1
"Hi, I’m sorry for your situation; however, benzos are supposed to only be used for very short periods of time; my suggestion is to seek psychiatric help and maybe start treatment with SSRIs or other medication intended for long term treatment of anxiety disorder, and keep benzos for emergencies at the beginning during the assessment period; meanwhile also start therapy sessions and in the end you will hopefully get better and maybe off of any medication",1
"Xanax has a cumulative side effect of making your anxiety worse in the long run. It sounds like your doctor failed to ween you off, which is absolutely what you should be doing if you've been taking it for years, even sporadically.",1
I was scared as well 3 years ago but turned out that alot of people suffer and stay on pills when there is a very high chance on them to recover by exposure and response prevention. I'm panic attack free for 3 years and I don't take pills,1
This is precisely why I have anxiety about anxiety meds,1
"Benzos are dangerous all I’m gonna say. I’ve been off my benzo for 18 months and have been in hell and wanna end my life. It’s ruined my health and has definitely damaged my brain, nervous system and gut and I will never recover. Begging God to end me life everyday",1
I work in the medical industry and doctors are cracking down on prescribing benzos. They will slowly be phasing out completely over the next few years. Kinda cruel to cut you off cold turkey but you should start looking at alternatives,1
"Depending where you live, your doctors are supposed to at least wean you off of any medicines. 

It is not physically safe to go cold Turkey off of meds. It’s also not really emotionally or mentally a safe occurance, as it generally messes with the person’s  life somehow. 

Anyways. 

I’ve been in your shoes (sorta). 

The fact you’ve been on this med for a while and it was helping is a good thing. Try to find a doctor ASAP and when talking to them to see which one might be good to schedule with, explain your situation. When I called I had to say “Hi, my name is (insert name), I’m calling because I need to transition to a different GP. I am looking to continue my current care, with a new doctor. I don’t feel the decisions my current doctor have made recently are therapeutically beneficial, nor ethical. I will be upfront, one of the really important medicines for me happens to be a controlled substance. I understand that can make it extra tricky to switch providers, especially with a medicine routine that happens to include a controlled substance as my anti-anxiety med. Is there any way you could write a note and see if there is a doctor at that practice who is 1.) accepting new patients 2.) who would be willing to work off of your current situation. So maybe not talking to your doctor fully bc your current doctor sounds kinda…complacent. But your new doctor will want/need to see medical records showing appointment notes and what prescriptions you’ve been on for a while and what not. 

It may help to offer to count the pills for them at appointments, or to send a picture showing you have what you should. Maybe start using a pill organizer and an app like MediSafe. The goal is to show them it is a therapy for you, not a habit, or an addiction, or anything funky like that. 

If you need to find a list of insurance approved providers, call your insurance company directly and ask for a list. 

Alternatively, you can contact the department of health and advocate for help from them, and they can connect you with and pay for your care to get these Rxs and your appointments. 

For Rxs, GoodRx and similar can save you all sorts of monies if that’s a thing. (: Just good to know. 

Something worth noting: we actually, at least in the US, have a patient right to a second opinion. 

There is nothing wrong with getting other opinions, even more than 2 other opinions is okay. 

What you don’t want to do is go in and try to dictate anything to a doctor, and you are better off not asking directly for the medicine by name, but describing it as “my anti anxiety medicine” or “my anxiety pill” or “a PRN for panic attacks” 

It’s a medicine that some people truly need, that just so happens to be a controlled substance. 

So you have to be open with your doctor of course, but you kind of have to tread lightly, especially if you’re needing something like a benzo or other narcotic refilled. 

Sorry that your doctor cut you off! That’s literally horrible of him. Especially with anti anxiety stuff! Ugh. 

Some tools that may be helpful: 

- doing an IOP program; this will connect you with a group so you learn skills and a psych to prescribe meds. If you show you’re using skills too along side the medicine, and you’re still needing the medicine, you’re much more likely to get it if you’re showing that you are trying other therapies other than pharmaceutical meds. 

- If you really feel like you need to, you can go to the ER for a panic attack. Sometimes they can get you right in, sometimes it’s busy. That’s how ERs are though. 

- I wouldn’t make this a habit. But Dramamine or benedryl or Tylenol PM can help with anxiety. Please be careful with this and be honest with your doctor. But don’t take these meds so much that when you’re honest with your doctor, they become super concerned. You want to show you’re using it as a PRN, not something to lean on every day and that’s it, no “coping skills”. 

Hydroxyzine is a similar medicine to benedryl in chemical composition; they are both in the anti-histamine class of medicines. 

- you may have luck with a mental health urgent care, but generally those PAs don’t have the qualifications to write controlled substance prescriptions, which would include your med. 

- Lastly, you can call a hotline. I have heard really good things about Behavioral Health Response (BHR).

Sorry my reply was so discombobulated. I have pretty severe ADHD that is currently going untreated. Hope that helps (:",1
"I emailed like 50 places near me asking if they prescribed Xanax. Only ONE said they MIGHT. The rest either didn’t respond or said no. 

I don’t get why psychs hate anxiety sufferers and want them to suffer so damn bad lmao

If you refuse to prescribe benzos to anyone regardless of their situation, you do not belong in the industry and should find work elsewhere. Sick of it",1
"Getting a prescription for Xanax is such a delicate matter.  Doctors are always so hesitant to prescribe it, and you really have to kind of dance around the topic to get a prescription, in my experience anyway.  I don’t think my psychiatrist would’ve prescribed it for me during our first several meetings, but I think if I asked for it now, after like 3 years of seeing them, they might.

I wish you good luck in finding a doctor that will prescribe it for you, and I hope it isn’t a long, drawn out process.",1
Does your Dr not understand quitting benzos cold turkey can kill you cause I'm pretty sure that's pharmacology 101,1
"I’ve never been prescribed Xanax and when asked my doctor said they basically won’t prescribe to new patients, it’s just too addictive of a drug that ends up causing more trouble for people that will become dependent and that need to quit

BUT You can suffer really bad side effects if you’re dependent on benzos and suddenly go off  without tapering, definitely see a new doctor, you’re literally one of the last remaining groups of people that is supposed to be using benzos",1
"OP, you're doctor is an idiot and is putting your life at risk. You should NEVER and I mean NEVER cold turkey benzos, ESPECIALLY Xanax. Withdrawal can kill, and it is one of 2 drugs that can kill you from withdrawals. The other being alcohol and this is because they both are received very similarly by the body. They numb your nerves and are both hyper addictive. Doctors don't prescribe alcohol and they overprescribe benzos. There isn't enough information out there on benzos IMO.

My first recommendation is to take a look at this resource - https://www.benzofree.org/features/benzofreepodcast/

The guy that runs the pod and the site, Dee, seems like such a sweet fella. He describes or his guests describe situations such as yours where the doctor has no idea how dangerous withdrawal of the rug is. While you can also die from overdosing, the withdrawal is the part that is scary for most. It simply feels good to listen to others that are struggling with very similar things as you. I promise this will help. You can even write him and he'll respond. He tries to respond to everyone.

Definitely find another doctor and look for one that sympathizes with benzo dependance. While there isn't a lot of awareness still around benzos, there is becoming more and more plus we can all help contribute to the overall knowledge of this shitty drug. It works for me too, but the negatives far outweigh the positives.

It's like smoking weed in a way. My first several times smoking weed, it was quite nice. I was able to relax and escape. Same with benzos. They actually aren't supposed to be prescribed more than 2 weeks. That's all it takes is 2 weeks to develop a pretty deep tolerance. After 2 weeks, just like weed, all that pleasant stuff slowly goes away because when you're relaxed youre not taking care of your feelings, daily tasks and goals. You swipe shit under the rug, days, years pass and you've had no success because you've been putting it off. The comfort of the relaxation outweighs the micro feelings of success.

As far as additional things that might help. I know it's cliche, but exercise exercise and exercise and stretching. This is something that typically sucks at first but gets much better in time. Diet is hyper important. There are actually lists of anti anxiety foods. They have various nutritional properties that help promote calm nerves. Sleeping can be difficult if you're coming off benzos, but sleep is very important. If you can work your body and mind to be tired at night, that's going to help a ton.

Supplements have helped me a good bit - 

* L-theanine
* Magnesium
* Ashwaganda
* Melatonin (at night)

* Digestive Enzymes
* Pro and pre-biotics
* Yogurt has live cultures in it that is good for gut health

M stomach becomes a wreck when I deal with benzo withdrawal and general anxiety. Enzymes and pro-pre biotics seem to help.

I'm sure I'm missing plenty more but hopefully this helps! Feel free to DM me with any questions or anything at all!",1
I had a doctor wouldn’t prescribe my my Ativan/lorazepam anymore which really pissed me off so I got a different doctor and had to wait another year till I was put back on it,1
"Yet you can go and self medicate with a bottle of vodka, no prescription required. It’s a similar situation to people not getting the pain relief they need and just being told to meditate through it. Structural problems in society are the root cause of addiction, not the correct use of medications",1
"I’m thinking about it, but I feel like I’m just going to be dismissed and labeled as a drug seeker",1
"This is my PCP.
I have thought about looking for a psychiatrist but I am hesitant because I know they will push SSRIS, which I have not had good experiences with. 
The numbness is the WORST. So fucking scary. It starts in my fingers and spreads up my arms, until my whole body feels like it’s almost vibrating. Sometimes I’m sure I will pass out which I haven’t yet thankfully. 
I hope you find something that works for you",1
I agree but Xanax is a good solution for the occasional bad panic attack. Just don’t take too often and you’ll never encounter problems with it,1
I tried many different types of meds and approaches to anxiety over 14 years and they still refuse to fill my Xanax prescription despite me using 30 over a 2 year period and having NO history of addiction or dependence on anything. Some doctors/psychs are just sadistic shitheads,1
"Considering that benzos are quite as addictive as heroin, these doctors aren’t that wrong",1
If you’re not using them regularly it’s not nearly as dangerous as a daily benzo user/abuser quitting cold turkey,1
do you understand the op takes xanax 2 or 3 times weekly at the most and a very low dose!? that’s reading 101,1
I have yet to find something that’s as effective at stopping a panic attack in its tracks,1
Yes most likely. It can be very dangerous. If you’re in the US the doctor is supposed to taper you off. If he won’t taper you find another doctor asap,1
I’ve been to behavioral health and they require therapy before they push meds. They would take into consideration that a certain drug has helped you before,1
I can help you right now bro,1
"I’m the opposite lol, my GP gave me Wellbutrin. My psychiatrist gave me a benzo but lowest dose and 30 every 60 days and sometimes I go over 60 days by a long shot. He’s really pushing a low dose SSRI but I fear side effects and I’d rather deal with mild anxiety than lose sexual function and/or weird side effects.

EDIT: words…said milf instead of mild haha",1
"A good psychiatrist will listen to your concerns about SSRIs but you’ll have to be open to trying other things besides just Xanax, because if you walk into a psych appointment with the sole goal of getting Xanax you will indeed be classified as a drug seeker",1
Same. I was on Xanax for 10 days as well as an anti depressant that I forgot the name of. I craved the Xanax at the end but I didn't want to go back on it. Using other methods to manage my GAD and agoraphobia,1
I eat eggs,1
"It’s not about thinking that you will abuse it, it’s a  physical matter: they are the most addictive medicine out there and there is a high risk of addiction for everyone; it’s against guidelines to prescribe benzos for more then some weeks",1
Here’s a radical idea: benzos are a lifesaver and genuine treatment for a lot of people with great outcomes,1
 Oh fuck I'm stupid I thought you were talking about  CBD!  Or weed and shit. Damn.  I'm too fucked to keep this shit up today,1
"Xanax is fast acting and doesn’t stay in your system long, and everyone reacts different. I’d talk to your doc man, say you want to taper to be safe. Sorry you’re going through this",1
"I’ve been prescribed propranolol before and honestly out of all the meds I’ve been out on, that one helped the psychical symptoms the most for me, specifically the breathing. I noticed when it kicked in bc my body would naturally take a big huge breath. Doesn’t help as much with the mental aspect but sometimes, depending on the level of attack, calming the physical part down can help your mind not race as bad",1
"So in order for a treatment to help me, I need to have a relevant degree? Sounds fake",1
"What dosage or buspar? It gave me wicked brain fog. I honestly just stopped it. I was on 15mg twice a day and then dropped to 10mg twice a day and it still gave me a headache, make me tired, feel like it causes more anxiety/tightness of the chest. I work better when I’m all hyped up but if a panic attack hits I feel like I’m dying.",1
"Yea I have klonopin .5 as needed and it knocks panic out. I usually only need 30 every 3 months as I try not to take it. Buspar made me feel worse. It’s just the tightness comes, I can’t take a deep breath then panic sets in then snowballs.

EDIT: words",1
Mine stopped prescribing because “we don’t prescribe them anymore”. Haven’t found another psych that will,1
"It’s not enough to becoming addicted or dependent. And remember, I might not have to refill them for two years.

I asked my driving tester if I could take one and he said he doesn’t care. I haven’t taken one on a drive day since though.

Also, I don’t take enough to feel tired or relaxed. I take enough to lower my anxiety to be bearable. 0.25 mg",1
"I know exactly how you feel, not fun. I hated buspar, it never calmed me down and it actually gave me severe insomnia. This sounds so crazy but they ended up diagnosing me with ADHD and apparently that was a big factor in my anxiety. They put me on adderall and I was so nervous it was going to make things worse and add to my insomnia but it calmed me down so much, hardly ever have panic attacks and my insomnia went away as soon as I started it. I slept like 11 hours after my first dose lol.",1
"For sure! I def understand. I’m unmedicated right now bc I just moved states and my appt with a new psych isn’t til end of may. So I am struggling. But yeah same, the breathing issue is a huge trigger to a full blown attack for me. I believe I did read that’s it’s a beta blocker yes",1
"While they are cracking down on benzos, I believe ultimately they are just trying to be more selective about who gets them. Benzos will always be around because there are people out there who absolutely need them. In my case, I have a pretty extensive record of mental illness including a recent hospital stay. And my doctor isn’t trying to decrease my dose, he actually upped my dose last appointment. They obviously aren’t a lifetime solution though and I know that I will have to get off eventually.  I am working on tapering right now",1
"I was on Ritalin as a high schooler very briefly. I’m always go go go, I function quite well in chaos but it’s very hard to stay on track for me. I tend to either overthink and over talk. Also I just stress about the dumbest shit. Like I have 2 young kids (like toddler and school aged) and when they do something that may not be right or what I’m asking I’m always quick to snap and say no rather than take a step back and say “it’s not hurting anything just let it go”. I’ve been trying breathing exercises but it doesn’t always work. I assume it needs to be a layered approach. I don’t know what ADHD is like but my brain is going 1000mph daily and I get agitated when things don’t do my way very easily. Never angry to where I’m like a monster but I get irritated at shit and when I look back I’m like “that was stupid and you just got all stressed for nothing”.

Proof that my brain is all over the place is my paragraph above lol",1
Working out has helped me a ton but now how my anxious brain works is it tells me “well if you don’t work out you’ll have anxiety” lol,1
Not if you weren’t using them daily,1
"Hey, sorry I had to try and distract myself for a bit. My doctor doesn’t want me using them in fear that I will become addicted. Not that I have shown signs of it and I have communicated that I don’t use them every day and only when I really need to. But he is hesitant now. This isn’t something new either, it’s in my records that I have severe anxiety and that I’ve tried many different meds",1
Good thing I don’t drive on them,1
"[Davies, J., & Read, J. (2018). A systematic review into the incidence, severity and duration of antidepressant withdrawal effects: Are guidelines evidence-based? Addictive Behaviors, 97(October 2019), 111–121. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.08.027](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460318308347)

Edit: In case you don't want to read the whole thing, here is one of the highlights (emphasis added):

>Given that antidepressant withdrawal is of higher incidence, severity and longer duration than current guidelines acknowledge, a number of key implications follow. Firstly, using the term 'discontinuation syndrome' to characterise antidepressant withdrawal runs contrary to the evidence. While 'discontinuation syndrome' has been used sporadically in the literature since the 1960s, its established meaning with respect to antidepressants was first operationally defined at the 'Discontinuation Consensus Panel' funded by Eli Lilly in 1996 (Schatzberg, 1997; Schatzberg et al., 1997), where it was delineated as a 'self-limiting syndrome' (e.g. comprising mild, transient and/or more distressing symptoms that can lead to impairments in functioning or productivity), 'typically resolving within 2 to 3 weeks' (Rivas-Vazquez, Johnson, Blais, & Rey, 1999) and to be distinguished from other contentious withdrawal forms such as those generated by benzodiazepines and sedative hypnotics (Fava et al., 2015).  
>  
>The panel's characterisation of withdrawal as 'self-limiting' and resolving within 2–3 weeks (a position still broadly reflected in current guidelines), however, appears unsupported not only by the evidence the panel cited to substantiate the ‘self-limiting’ claim, (ADH, 1996) but by subsequent evidence on duration (such as that covered by this review). **Furthermore, defining 'withdrawal syndromes' as those pertaining to benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, and 'discontinuation syndromes' to SSRIs, not only erroneously separates antidepressant withdrawal from other CNS drug withdrawals but also minimises the vulnerabilities induced by SSRIs (Nielsen, Hansen, & Gotzsche, 2012).** The term 'discontinuation syndrome' may further mislead as antidepressant withdrawal can occur without discontinuation (e.g. between two doses of rapid-onset and short-acting drugs and with a decrease in medication) (Fava et al., 2015), while the term 'syndrome' subtly medicalises withdrawal by associating it with a disorder endogenous to the person than with a non-dysfunctional reaction to the cessation of a drug. For these reasons, this review supports Fava et al. (2015) in stating that 'discontinuation syndrome' should be replaced with a term more consistent with the evidence, such as 'withdrawal' or 'withdrawal reaction'.",1

"Hi all,

I wanted to share a compilation of recurrent themes from my brief psych rotation and was wondering if you could vet them since they're going into my long-term memory of things to know as a future non-psychiatrist.

1. Timelines- how long has it been going on? This often affects which diagnosis you make. Always establish onset.
2. Is it severe enough to affect day to day function? How are the patient’s school/work, relationships, ADLs? Are they taking care of themselves?
3. The combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy is better than either alone for almost any psychiatric condition.
4. Asking about suicidality doesn’t increase the patient’s risk of suicide.
5. The suicide spectrum: ideation (passive vs active) -> plan  ->(taken steps towards carrying out plan?) intent  -> attempt (lethality vs discoverability) ->completion
6. Xanax is never the solution. If you can go your entire career without prescribing Xanax once, you’ll have had a great career.
7. Harm reduction. People will hurt themselves, help them hurt themselves less.
8. Collateral info is key. Talk to patients family and friends when appropriate to gather key information that will help you take care of the patient.
9. Things run in families including diseases and cures i.e. if a therapy worked for a patient’s family member, it’ll probably work for the patient too.
10. Be biopsychosocial in approach to and management of patients, as opposed to being solely biomedical. This is a newer therapeutic paradigm that tries to incorporate cultural and social influences on a patient's care.
11. Everyone deserves psychoeducation. This is a form of psychotherapy that is essentially a fleshed out informed consent process where you inform patients of their diagnosis, risks, treatments, alternatives, and prognoses in an effort to recruit their help in taking care of themselves.
12. Titrate up, taper down. This applies to almost all psych meds as the risk of starting at a too high dose can cause bad things e.g. sertraline-> GI upset, lamotrigine-> Stevens-Johnson or sudden discontinuation can lead to issues e.g. discontinuation syndrome of SSRIs.
13. There are things you will learn for exams that you will never see e.g. serotonin syndrome or trazodone priapism. It might be good to learn the common but less tested things for real life, because that’s what patients will care about.

Thank you,

"Hello. I am a mental health practitioner and was wondering about the preferences for this group regarding the prescription of benzodiazepines. I have a client who has had a history of successful use of Xanax, as prescribed for anxiety related to autism, PTSD, social anxiety, and probably some borderline personality d/o as well. She also has a seizure disorder. She took Xanax 0.5 a.m. and 1.0 hs for 4 years and was able to work full time until her doctor died. Her new doctors refuse to prescribe benzos because they are “dangerous and kill people”.  Now she is on disability and more depressed because she can’t seem to hold a job. She sees me twice weekly for 6 months and has made a lot of progress with counseling. She has never missed an appointment. I would
Love to see how she does on Xanax since reports have been so positive in the past. She refuses to buy Xanax from the street (thank God for that at least) and I would never advocate for that! 

What’s your personal preference on prescribing Xanax? Can you explain your decision making process here? And is there any information that I, as her counselor, can offer to assist her in securing the medication that was shown to be effective in the past . (Efficacy of past treatment was verified by a former co-worker and a personal friend —2 different people).  Thanks for your time

The issue of overdose deaths is so especially concerning to me because it seems like it *should be* so easy take care of with proper access to education and harm reduction materials.

Allow me to make a loose analogy using alcohol to illustrate some key points regarding the matter:

 When was the last time you worried about someone accidentally drinking themselves to death (bad example maybe, perhaps some of you have?) To rephrase, I'm guessing if you have, it was undoubtedly because the person was a suicide risk or had alcohol dependence or other pertinent health issue like liver disease. You would never expect to hear of someone *accidentally* drinking themselves to death in a situation where they intended to steer clear of that. It would have to be either a freak accident, or a case of a very ignorant and foolhardy kid perhaps. Otherwise it would be unthinkable.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've heard, someone would need a BAC of around 0.15-0.25 to be at real risk of toxic health effects (not caused by poor decisions while drunk), and probably you'd need 0.30-0.40 to be at serious risk of dying from overdose.

Let's say that perhaps a lightweight drinker's BAC raises 0.02 per drink, in that case were looking at at least 20 drinks consumed in a short enough period, and we'd guess for some people it might take take perhaps 40 or more drinks to be close to the lethal threshold.

I don't know what you think, but to me that seems like a decent margin of safety, or ""therapeutic index"" that is. It's not perfect but it's pretty good. 20-40 drinks, I'm sure, would feel like *work* to consume, you would never just accidentally consume that much. And I think for most of us, we would be already so drunk by the halfway point that we would be apt to pass out or lose motivation to drink further. I think it's safe to say even 5-6 drinks would get all the non-alcoholics present considerably intoxicated. But to be sure, even drunk as you'd be, you'd still be a long ways off from the threshold fatal overdose.

Now I know this is somewhat apples and oranges here; alcohol is not the same as heroin, and alcoholic beverages are government labeled for drug content, but hear me out. Heroin, fentanyl, xanax etc, all those drugs associated with OD deaths, they are all (at least when not taken in combination) actually said to possess an even larger ""therapeutic index"" than alcohol, much larger in many cases. The TI of heroin is supposed to be something like 70:1 (though it's worth noting, they come up with these figures by  comparing a potentially lethal dose with an ""effective"" dose, and ""effective"" can seemingly be defined as any amount you want within reason; why I used quotations). I read that one source estimated an average person would need to consume at least 100-300mg of morphine to die from it (I'm not certain of the route of administration, it may have been oral which is much weaker in bioavailability and effect than the parental routes). I don't believe that was from a rigorous study either, but a website of a for-profit rehab, unfortunately.

I'm currently looking for good research on what the threshold is, if not in humans than at least chimps or some other primate. Posted below is one article I found. 

There's something rather baffling about many of these deaths. I feel like if we're talking about death from respiratory depression which you might call *opioid overdose proper* to distinguish from other causes of death like choking on vomit in one's sleep (pulmonary aspiration), then it's seeming bizarre how many people just seem to one day drop dead, and it's not like all of them are either suicidally depressed, ignorant of safety measures, or woefully under-educated. 

Speaking of under-educated though there is no shortage of under-educated drug users. You know when a common piece of junkie advice is ""ear wax makes a good lubricant for the inside of your syringe when it gets old and the plunger gets hard to move"" that there is a lot of progress to make in that regard, yikes... I wish that I had made that up.... so much for sterile injection huh?

And it's important to consider, unlike your average weekend drinker, many if not most people using heroin have a serious tolerance to it, build from months or years of steady use.. Many of them I've met say they can't even get more than ""well"" even injecting massive amounts per day (that is, for these people taking it only staves off withdrawal, making them feel no better than ""normal"" rather than ""high""). It seems like in practice there is something of an ""effect ceiling,"" meaning once you've gotten so tolerant to the drug, you get to a point where you can no longer get any substantial net effect from it, beyond *preventing the negative effects of not taking it* (withdrawal). A complete re-balancing of homeostasis you could say.

So with this in mind, it's strange that one does actually hear, not always rarely, of such ""ultra-tolerant,"" experienced individuals dying from apparent ODs, even without having recently gotten clean (or tried to, as this can undo their tolerance and makes them more vulnerable to OD). 

Weirder yet is that apparently, it's just as common for ""overdose deaths"" to be apparently caused, not by the textbook cause--respiratory depression, as we'd expect, but by pulmonary aspiration (accidental choking on such as from vomiting suddenly, etc) and pulmonary edema (the victim's lungs were found to be filled with fluid, thought to be potentially caused by allergenic substances adulterating the drugs, such as quinine). 

The research show that, suspiciously, while benzos get recorded in overdose deaths almost as often as opioids, strangely alcohol is reported far less often. This is particularly strange given that alcohol is much more ubiquitous than benzos are, surely you'd expect it to turn up much more often than benzos wouldn't you? Could it be that alcohol is not taken as seriously as worthy of investigation for some reason? I can imagine that perhaps some overworked medical examiner would stop investigating an overdose death once opioids/pills are confirmed in the victim's system. 

I'm really just looking for the truth in this apparent mystery here, for both the knowledge itself and the lives it will save... if you have anything to contribute from your own studies, professional experience or elsewhere, please don't hesitate to chime in. I often worry that the shame and stigma of drug use and overdose death is what prevents the conversation on harm reduction from getting out there to where it's needed.

Stay safe all you out there and take care regardless! :-)",1
"Hi Everyone!

We are a group of students and faculty at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School who are interested in ways to study psychiatry through film. For the month of October, we posted about horror films each day leading up to Halloween (check it out on [r/halloween](https://www.reddit.com/r/halloween)). Our new project will include the analyses of twelve thrilling Christmas movies/ TV episodes for the twelve days leading up to Christmas.

This post is for December 20, featuring the movie *Krampus*.

Krampus 

I know this movie was not on the original watch list. But due to my inability to find 12-24 and to keep in with the theme, I'm going to talk about Krampus. For the purpose of this discussion, I'm going to focus more on the psychiatric talking points and less on giving a synopsis of the movie, which is fairly straightforward. Like all Christmas movies it has some tried and true traditions, family members who can't stand each get together just for the holidays, fighting ensues, magical wishes made, and a mythical creature (Krampus) comes to kill everyone with his demonic Christmas-themed friends in tow. I think that's summary enough; let's move on to the analysis.   

So this wonderfully joyous Christmas tale begins with a fine example of Antisocial Personality Traits. As what appears to be hundreds of people flock into a store to do their holiday shopping, they literally do so without any regard to the rights of others as evidenced by trampling the workers and one another, physically fighting, breaking skateboards over one another heads, and I might be going out on a limb here but those security guards seemed to really enjoy using their stun guns on the unruly customers. I'm going to call this one traits for all these ""shoppers"" since we don't know enough about them to fully diagnose a disorder. It's possible that this is a onetime thing, or one time of year thing (and if we want to argue that this is simply American culture, then a cultural sanctioned action) one scene isn't enough to diagnose any of these people just yet. We would need to know more about their childhoods, their relationships, and how their actions impact their livelihood. 

Speaking of Antisocial Personality Disorder, on the same spectrum we see a great example of Conduct Disorder as Max and one of his classmates get into a brawl during the Christmas play. I'm going to give Max a pass on this one, despite drop kicking his fellow student, based on what we see of the movie and Max's defense of his actions, it seems more like a one time event. However, based on Max's description of his classmate being a bully, I'm going to leave it in the differential for his classmate. 

(Note: Grandma (Omi) has A Christmas Carol playing in the background while baking as the Engel family returns home. I'm sure she's psychoanalyzing the movie, while also making gingerbread men. She seems like the type to multitask). 

Since we're on the topic of personality disorders and traits. Max's father (Tom) comes across as having some Narcissistic Personality Traits as well. Even when his family is trying to spend time with him, he insists that he is too important due to his job to do so. He makes it sound like a grand sacrifice just to be around for the holidays. Based on other interactions throughout the movie, he certainly seems to display a lot of self- aggrandizing. But again, he does not seem to meet diagnostic criteria for a disorder, and at times is able to display a genuine understanding of others' emotions. 

We might as well round out a discussion of Cluster B Personality Disorders, seeing as how gathering family together for the holidays seems to really bring them out. Aunt Dorothy brings out some great Borderline traits. Her showing up unannounced with a suitcase, certainly shows her impulsivity, as well as, her intense fear of abandonment. Additionally, the way she looks at the world certainly has a ""splitting"" component in which things are either good or bad. In this case everything Linda does with her family is ""good"" and everything Sarah does is ""bad"". Based on the family's comments, she appears to lack interpersonal relationships. 

Just for the sake of discussion we can even add a little bit of Histrionic Personality traits in the way that both couples are constantly trying to one up one another, and with a constant need for their families to be the center of attention. 

Moving on to another great theme of this movie, Substance Use Disorder. Throughout the film, various family members are seen drinking alcohol. Howard even starts with a nice ""eye-opener"" the first day they wake up without power. Aunt Dorothy gives alcohol to the children, perpetuating the cycle, and Tom starts drinking even before the family arrives. Thanks to Beth's video call to her boyfriend (Derek) we also see Marijuana use in this film. 

During the call between Beth and Derek they also make reference to Sarah's use of the benzodiazepine, Xanax. ""Your mom popping Xanax again?"" Derek asks. ""Like candy"" is Beth's reply. While I suspect that this also falls under Substance Use Disorder, since Sarah is likely not taking her medication as prescribed, the use of it and the many other references of the family telling Sarah to be calm for once, and that she worries too much, makes me suspect she has a Generalized Anxiety Disorder diagnosis. Though, she may want to switch to an SSRI after the holidays. 

A discussion of Sarah also brings up another personality disorder: Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder. This disorder requires neither obsessions, nor compulsions, but Sarah's constant need for cleanliness (a longstanding trait based on Linda's collateral), order, and to be in control really makes me think she has the traits, if not the disorder. 

Another random psych tidbit. Howie Jr. does not speak throughout the entirety of the movie. Likely he is displaying Mutism. If Howie Jr. talks when he is outside the home of his aunt, then I'm inclined to call this Selective Mutism, as it appears to be a consistent failure to speak in a specific social situation. However, I would also want to perform an exam to ensure this isn't communication disorder or better explained through autism spectrum disorder. Based on his other family members, it is possible that Howie Jr. does experience severe anxiety and may have an underlying biological component. 

Not wanting to forget about Cluster A Personality Disorders, I think it might be safe to give Omi Schizotypal Personality Traits as she certainly displays a lot of ""magical"" thinking, including her belief in magic, Santa Claus, and Krampus. However, based on her upbringing, it is entirely possible that her beliefs are culturally sanctioned and as such would negate this diagnosis. 

Of course, to make this film simple, we could chalk up all the auditory, visual, and tactile hallucinations to ""Folie a Deux"" or Shared Psychosis. Everyone in the family experiences the same illusions. However, we may also want to check for some environmental factors such as lead poisoning to explain the Krampus. If this is Shared Psychosis, it certainly seems to stem from Omi and her beliefs in Krampus. Beliefs that are easily transferred to Max and eventually the rest of the family. 

Anyway, I'm going to leave you all with a reminder that with Christmas season upon us ""you better watch out"".

"So, i'm not sure where to begin. This might be a long and uninteresting post, but I would love it if someone could give some opinions about what I should do next. English is not my first language either, so if you notice any obvious grammatical/spelling errors, there you have it. 

I'm going to provide sort of like a timeline, or just sketch it up to what I feel right now, and what i've been through, and everything.

I'm a 21 (soon 22) year old male, and as of now, I suffer from EXTREMELY crippling GAD (general anxiety disorder, but I think that you guys know that), Panic Syndrome with agoraphobia, and social anxiety. 
I've always had the social anxiety throughout my entire life, but it's my recently developed mental conditions that are ruining my life. On top of that, or well, more enveloped in those diagnoses, I'm a hypochondriac, i'm terrified of diseases and especially those type of acute ailments such as heart attacks and strokes/aneurysms. But i've had that all my life, but during my first 20 years my fear was more about cancer and more long-lasting illnesses. 
I was easily depressed during my teens, but that had more to do with the fact that I had very low self-esteem (and I still do) but as soon as I started to get attention from girls that faded away. Since then i've been an upbeat and generally happy guy, and I still am, most people don't notice it through my anxiety though, and it's very often that I can't feel either sad nor happy since fear takes over everything. 

It all started approximately a year and half ago, when I was smoking weed at a friends house (not my first time either, and I know that was foolish of me), and I got my first panic attack. 
I told them to call an ambulance because I thought I was having a stroke or something (the lights kept fading in and out and my entire face was numb, and i could barely stand up), and well, they didn't because they understood that it was in fact something that had to do with the weed. 
I could barely move for several hours because my body was so weak and I was petrified, but the feeling soon vanished. 
After that I was fine, completely fine, for about a week. Then a second panic attack came along, and this time without the help of any sort of drug usage. (I abstained from alcohol and any sort of drugs until I was 20, and i completely stopped drinking and smoking weed when i started getting my panic attacks). I was terrified, and I couldn't understand what was going on, I thought for sure that I was about to die. Anyhow, I started getting more and more frequent panic attacks, and developed General Anxiety Disorder in between the attacks, and soon anxiety started to rule my life. I because more reclusive and I didn't want to go out to bars or hang out with friends anywhere other than my home, but I sometimes managed to get myself together and go to a movie or just hang out somewhere else than my home, and I could occasionally do some errands. But working or studying was impossible, I actually had to drop my Dutch studies because I just couldn't go to school with my anxiety. 
It just so happened that my anxiety went up and down all the time and I could never know what to expect from it, and every time, every symptom was extremely physical, most of the time I never knew that I was even scared or stressed out myself. 
Anyway, about two months back I had an EXTREME panic attack that manifested itself as cardiac symptoms (chest pain, a numb left arm, extremely rapid heartbeat, some other areas of pain, hard to breathe, etc) and I had to call an ambulance. Turns out that there's nothing wrong with my heart, and that I don't have any (known) somatical diseases, besides some eczema on my scalp and acne and whatnot. 
I've done several EKG's and it seems like there's nothing wrong with me. 

Anyway, after that incident i've been terrified to do anything that involves physical strain on my body, because I've felt like my heart can't take it. I used to love taking walks even with my anxiety, for a month after the incident I was too scared to even go for a 10-minute walk around the block. 
My legs turn to spaghetti but are also extremely heavy, I can't breathe at all and I get paresthesia throughout parts of my body, so I immediately start to draw the conclusion that my heart is damaged and can't handle the stress. 
So now here I am... i've started to handle it a bit better, but I can't go anywhere outside of the small suburb that I live in, and I prefer only being outside for a short time, as short as I can really, and this is completely ruining my life. 

I have EXTREMELY physical symptoms of my anxiety (which I still fear is something else than pure anxiety alone), and paresthesia and pain in my left arm (which according to doctors and physiotherapists are nerve or muscular pains or just psychosomatic entirely), and general back pain mostly focused on my left shoulder and especially my left shoulder blade (everytime I move it, it makes a, or actually several ""popping"" sounds..) and i've been going to chiropractors, naprapaths and physiotherapists and have only found very short-term relieve of my physical symptoms, and not all of it. 

As you might guess from my diagnosis, i'm very very skeptical and frightened of medicines and especially side effects. 
Right now i'm on 225 mgs of Lyrica (Pregabalin) and 10 mgs of Buspar a day, and I find that it barely helps me at all. 
My muscles are so tense, and my body is in a constant state of anxiety and my fight or flight-responses are always triggered, i'm so easily startled. And most of all my pulse is elevated, my body feels just... wrong, I can hardly ever breathe, and my entire body hurts. My pain is almost to the point of getting close to Fibromyalgia, but since i'm a 21 year old male, my chances of having that are pretty slim. 
I refuse to eat SSRI's and SNRI's because i'm just too scared of side effects and the first weeks of increased anxiety (because my anxiety is already TOO FUCKING HIGH), and my doctor just keeps wanting me to either eat Cymbalta or take an neuroleptic (without me being psychotic or suffer from any sort of diagnosis that's not anxiety-related), i'm not bipolar or suffer from borderline, i'm not even depressed. 

BUT HERE IS THE REAL KICKER: I've applied, and managed to get into a 3-year archaeological program at the university in the city where I live, and it starts IN A WEEK. 
And my psychiatrist wants to put me on SNRI's which she knows elevates anxiety levels during the first week, without any sort of relief for that anxiety. 
I'm still too scared because the physical symptoms I get whenever I try to leave the confines of my small suburb, like taking the u-train, the bus, or even a car ride, makes me feel like i'm about to die. It's not panic anxiety, it's just so much general anxiety on such an extreme level that it's ruining my life, made me lose my dream girl, and just makes me have to live at home with no income whatsoever, because I can't keep a job even if I tried to.

So right now, 225 mgs of Lyrica a day but according to my doctor she doesn't want me to raise my dosage on it because she thinks that I'll always have to increase the dosage (which might be true) and the Buspar that i'm on, triggered some sort of paranoid delusions (I thought that I was going to die, got images of me in the hospital and just felt trapped and closed in when I was OUTSIDE, and at one point I thought I had died, and the bus stop was some sort of purgatory... SAY WHAAAT), which is completely unlike any of my usual symptoms, and even on a very very low dosage, just 15 mgs a day. 

So what should I take, what should ask for, when i'm too scared of the typical SSRI's or SNRI's, and just generally don't respond to antihistamines as an anxiolytic? The ONLY thing that has worked so far is benzodiazepines, but here in Sweden doctors are generally against it, but especially MY doctor, she refuses to even give me any for the first period if i try an SNRI (which I'm also against because of the sexual side effects, something that i'm also experiencing from my Lyrica, i don't want to worsen it)... Oxezapam which is an extremely weak benzodiazepine is the standard here in Sweden, I won't even get that. It's weaker than valium and xanax. we also have Ativan but it's NEVER prescribed unless you've tried all the other medicines. 
I know that benzodiazepines could help me with my studies, but at a high cost. But I can't get anything like that, I think it's unfair because If i can't study now, i'll be completely cut off from any sort of chance at getting money, because we get paid to study here in Sweden, oh well. 
I'm also starting CBT soon but I hate my psychologist, because I can't relate to her at all (which isn't a problem i usually have, she's just cold and generally un-empathetic), so that's of course something that i'm going to try, but I need something to take down my general anxiety first.

That's about it... any sort of insight or advice for what I should ask for when it comes to medicines, or just a kind word... go for it. Ask me anything, say anything. 
Just try to help me if you can, thank you.

"* I feel that patients are over diagnosed and over medicated. 75-80 % patients don’t need to be put on meds for lifetime and would benefit from therapy and other psychosocial interventions.

So don't overdiagnose and overmedicate. Tell your patients that they need therapy and other psychosocial interventions, whatever those may be, if they wish to achieve the kind of life they long for. If they refuse to go to therapy or seek these other supports, it's on them. Can't force someone to do anything unless they meet hospitalization criteria, which only gives you control for a limited time. Can't control them. Can't save them.

* Psychological, social and economic issues cannot be fixed with meds and if that’s what you throw at them then don’t be surprised that these patients keep getting hospitalized again and again.

If ""these patients"" are getting ""hospitalized again and again"", they sound very low functioning to begin with. Western civilization has bred misery beyond a level that anybody can fully fathom. Modern society requires high intelligence and sophistication to navigate effectively given the complex systems that exist. Be realistic about what the patients are capable of in the environment they live in. Patients that keep decompensating with a large degree of blame on the environment then need to relocate to a more adaptive environment that they are less likely to decompensate in and can achieve more meaningful quality of life and function in a way that contributes meaningfully as well. If the patient doesn't make these changes, then it's on them. Can't control them. Can't save them.

* These patients require better understanding of trauma, personality issues, family dynamics, as well as economic, social and cultural stressors.

Tell the patients this then. If they don't listen, it's on them. Tell them to read books, go online, go to therapy, go to church and be a part of local community. Tell them it's their responsibility to develop an understanding of all these things if they wish to achieve the life they long for. If they don't do this, it's on them. Can't control them. Can't save them.

* DSM is bogus!

Sort of. It's a decent starting point for a clinical psychiatrist. A good psychiatrist should become disillusioned with it eventually, while appreciating the value it afforded and still affords. It's the egg shell that keeps the chicken safe while developing, but it needs to respectfully be broken eventually.

* Also most of the psychopharmacology research is pretty lame and heavily influenced by pharmaceutical industry.

Lol. Yeah. All major institutions are corrupt and captured. Western civilization is pretty fucked for the foreseeable future if these parasitic bureaucrat types are allowed to continue in positions of power.

* Since the field has basically reduced itself to mindless pill pushing in service of biological reductionism, therefore it’s going to be the first one to be completely run and taken over by mid levels in near future.

The field can go in the direction of ""mindless pill pushing"", but the quality of outcome will continue to decline. The pendulum will swing back towards the other direction eventually, and I believe it is slowly doing so already. I believe the push for excessive mid-level autonomy has already proven to be a shitshow if they are allowed to run wild widespread. The outcomes on average are much poorer for severe mental illness and any kind of complex psychiatric and medical case unless they are supervised by a psychiatrist who knows the ins and outs. The field will not become ""run and taken over"" by these mid-levels. Once enough patients suffer and/or die, the push will come to a stop, and balance will be worked towards. Don't be so nihilistic.

* I love my profession and I want it to be better than that.

Be the best you can be first. Embody and consistently live in accordance with the values and convictions you claim to love. Help those who are open to it. Leave those who aren't open to help alone. In the end, the quality of the work will speak for itself. Psychiatry has a massive quality control issue. It's rare to meet a good psychiatrist. It's rare to meet a totally moronic psychiatrist. The vast majority are mediocre. Because patients don't die on an operating table with us, it takes years for the poor outcomes to reveal themselves. Give it time. In the end, truth always prevails. Catastrophe is necessary, because it shows those who refused to see previously the error of their ways. Just do you and make a positive difference in the ways you can.",1
"Imo, depending on acuity, it can be appropriate to medicate someone to oblivion. This can lessen the volatility of a persons situation and help avoid outcomes that are even worse than forcing medication on somebody. Ideally, the person is then de-pharmacologized, behaviorally rehabilitated, and released from such a high acuity situation, but generally, in the practice of psychiatry, there’s an incentive to keep patients medicated that creates a conflict of interest. However, if the person has not been justly convicted of a crime, this practice can be really bad because it can amount to minority report style pre-justice and forced slavery to the pharmaceutical industry and behavioral health systems, and conflicts with actually helping patients and violates their basic rights. However, from the perspective of the legal system (this is from an American 🇺🇸 perspective) everyone’s rights ideally are balanced against the rights of others, because of the vague nature of definition of crimes like assault that often are deferred to the behavioral health system before charges are even officially administered by the law, and the person who is assumed to have assaulted (as an example crime, there are others as well like drug use) is lucky if they never end up with an official charge and instead is just put on a psych hold and has to spend some time in a ward. When the acuity is relatively low, people are still overmedicated, sometimes because the clinicians lack the spine and/or communicative skill to tell the patient they really don’t need the medication they think might help and make it make sense to them. Doing so can in some cases raise acuity to a degree that medication would be appropriate anyway. On the question of rights, I think it’s cute that people think they are totally inalienable, and usually tells me the person holding the position that they are has led a life privileged enough to not have to realize this is simply not always the case, or at least has enjoyed the particular privileges that allow one to hold that position. So yes, people are over diagnosed and over medicated but it really depends on what’s reasonable in a given situation and community norms. It seems reasonable to encourage clinical staff to be aware of the fact that if they do not have an eye towards letting people go back into society, they are manufacturing medical problems that they are then profiting off of, and it’s important to not encourage more problems than initially existed. Patients, I think, need to be educated about these phenomena, so that they can make informed decisions about their care. That’s what I say about this at this point in my experience.",1
"I'm a psychologist, and I agree, though it took me a long time and a lot of research to come to this conclusion, and I don't mean to speak disparagingly of psychiatrists - I work with many of them, and have a great deal of respect for the work that they do.

If you're interested and not yet already aware, check out the story of how the descriptive trend in psychiatric diagnosis became endemic with publication of DSM-III in 1980. It was essentially what led to the current issues we're facing in psychiatric care that you describe in your post, and was essentially exploited by pharmaceutical companies as an opportunity for market expansion as the number of disorders grew rapidly and gained popularity following its publication",1

"Maybe? The pendulum always swings... yada yada... big pharma and insurance companies suck... yadda yadda... I overall agree with the sentiment, but not the numbers. There's plenty of patients that actually do better with meds than they could without, and with most of my patients, especially ones that have not had terrible failures and recurrence with discontinuing meds, I often will try to discuss an exit strategy early in the treatment course (usually not until they have stabilized). Some medicines are meant to be taken long-term and some aren't. Some medicines are helpful for some people and some are more harm than help. 

The problem with these types of posts is you are making broad reaching generalized statements for something that is more individualized. 

We've all seen examples where meds were necessary and where they were unnecessary and actually harmful, but I'm compelled to give my more personal anecdotal one: My uncle was regarded as a genius. He did very well in engineering, could solve problems incredibly quickly and well, developed unique perspectives and creative solutions for problems, and everyone had high expectations for him. In early adulthood he experienced what I can only surmise was likely a manic episode with psychotic features, he then had psychosis in the absence of mood symptoms, and he had depressive episodes that resulted in withdrawal and severe suicide attempts (electrocution by his own design). They didn't have a name for what he had then, so he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. 

This poor man struggled for years, often only receiving relief with ECT for a short time, and being treated by a range of terrible and ineffective treatments including insulin shock which briefly sent him into a diabetic coma. Luckily, during his early life new medications called antipsychotics hit the market and he was stabilized with one of the first atypicals in the 1950s. He went on to lead a much better life, remaining stable save a couple episodes of decompensation, working as an engineer (missing 2 fingers due to one of the early attempts) for decades. Without medications he would have died, never been brought back to himself for his own mind and for his family. 

That same med that kept him stable for decades has been quoted retrospectively as being one of the least effective and worst meds in terms of adverse effects by both modern standards and by studies in the last 20 yrs. It still saved his life. Yes our meds suck sometimes, but sometimes they are better than the alternative and even the bad ones can afford relief at times. Will we be called barbaric by Dr. McCoy in the future, absolutely, but we work with what we have.",1

"Nobody is refusing to acknowledge anything. PSychiatry in certain places (especialy the US, doubly so in state institutions) doesn't function ideally, that's for certain.

You're simply conflating 2 different things together, and generalising your experience to mean that psychiatry doesn't know anything, can't treat anything; and by extension (seemingly, although, please correct me if I'm wrong), that mental illness is either not really something that exists, or at any rate not something that very often robs a person of their capacity for introspection and free will, rendering them sometimes a danger to themselves or others.

Or else tell me what it was that your meant or propose.

It's good to have people who are skeptics of the institutional pressures that go on at those facilities, don't get me wrong... but unless you decide to go to medschool with the specific intention of going into psych and climbing the ladder at one of those institutions to change the culture (and even then you'd realise you cant' do much because much of the way things work at state penal/psychiatric centers are inescapable derivations of the legal framework the people in question have to work with), what's there to do?

Maybe... as I mentioned elsewhere... as I said, that most countries adopt the human right commission's guidelines in the strictest absurd sense, and altogether abolish the possibility of involuntary treatment and holds... As I said, that'd certainly make my job far easier and more enjoyable. Sadly, it's also my sincere belief that it would lead to (even more than right now!) more suffering and deaths among the mentally ill and their families, and to a lesser degree society at large.

Maybe it's a problem without solution. God knows ""voluntary, absurdly flexible, last resort"" treatment programmes have been tried everywhere in the world, mostly to dismaying results. Maybe we haven't quite found the appropriate recipe just yet, but I just think that, with all the information that we have, we **need** to choose between the lesser of two evils. That doesn't mean that criticising what evils remain (certainly those that could be drastically bettered, as you mention in state institutions) isn't valuable, but at some point it reaches a limit where there's no much use for it.

edit: it just ocurred to me, that we're not even talking about the same thing. When I say ""involuntary commitment and treatment"", I'm not thinking about the kinds of instuttions you mention (which are extremely few and far between in my country, and can only get there via a judicial sentence, normally after a violent crime has ocurred); but rather about short-term hospitalistions of the kind you'd get if you presented to an emergency department with a mania.",1
"> There should be objective evidence that said illnesses are in fact illnesses, and that they do in fact rob someone of their free will. Otherwise, you are essentially deeming a person to be globally irrational through the fact that you decide to consider certain behaviours of theirs ""illnesses,"" and then confining them for displaying said behaviours.

It's obvious where I stand on this debate, but as I said, it's not for me to decide. I just think your outlook is deeply naive. Mental ilness' existence is as grounded on science as modern science can see; I think you're referring to the issue of no definite biomarkers being available to definitely diagnose a mental illness.

It's clear you're not a psychiatrist, because this insistence that nothing else other than biomarkers is diagnostically valid is plainly absurd. Not the point of this discussion, but wanted to put it out there. If we're going to pretend that for instance, the woman I saw a couple of months ago in the ED, with a normal job, a husband, and a 2 week-old at home, who developed a post-ñartum psychosis where the main delusion was that her baby had been exchanged for a robot to spy on her; that I couldn't correctly diagnose her with my tools of anamnesis and mental examination, then I don't know what to tell you. Maybe some day I'll be compelled by law to just let her go in that situation in the future, and for the husband (who brought her in scared shirtless) to fend for himself and not be able to take his eyes off her for fear she'd try to ""open up the robot"" (a comment she'd made); but it won't take away the statistical reality that in those instances, the risk of fillicide or suicide are un acceptably high. But hey, there's a chance, though the philosofh of the unknowablenature of subjectivity, that this woman **could actually be behaving in such a way due to her own free will**, right?

Well, no. She spent a couple of weeks at the hospital and was able to return home being mostly her former self.

> We shouldn’t ignore these issues. We should offer genuine help and recognition to people experiencing mental suffering, without the threat of involuntary hospitalization (or any threat for that matter). 

That sounds fantastic! Except, we already do that (at least in countries with universal healthcare). You're ignoring the nature of psychoses and other illnesses that take away the capacity to understand that you're going through is, in fact, the result of mental illness.

This debate is decades and decades old. There's nothing new to discuss here. Curiously the opinions on the matter can be predicted by the experience the opinion holder has with treating mental illnesses.

> . We should only intervene if the person has children who depend on them, if the person is under 18 years of age, or if their actions will cause harm to others

Your first 2 rules are completely arbitrary, and the third one suffers from the very problem you think you know about (but don't really): who is going to decide ""when someone's actions will cause harm to others"", as if we were living in Minority Report?

> Respecting people’s wishes includes not forcefully preventing suicide.

As someone who a) specialises in chronic and resistant depressions, but also b) also taken part in committees to greenlight cases of requests for euthanasia (available in my country), I couldn't disagree more forcefully. Suicide intent due to mental illness is **not** the same thing as the request for the compassionate ending of a life through euthanasia, and you're attempting to conflate them. Only in the latter is free will preserved.",1
">It’s clear you’re not a psychiatrist, because this insistence that nothing else other than bio markers is diagnostically valid is absurd.

Grouping certain behaviours together can certainly be of use, for things like statistical purposes, or ease of reference. 

Mental illness is a term used to describe human psychological suffering. The point where psychological suffering becomes pathological is defined in an arbitrary manner, and has shifted numerous times in the past. Diagnosis of the vast majority of mental illnesses doesn’t involve any test for some kind of cause leading to an objectively observed pathology, it involves giving a label to the type of suffering experienced. 

There is a problem with psychiatry not being anywhere close to identifying the biological basis for these illnesses, which can be used to take away people’s rights. 

>but it won’t take away the statistical reality that in those instances, risk of fillicide or suicide are un acceptably high.

The woman in your example was clearly acting in a way that had potential to harm her family, evident by her husband’s distress, her account, and statistics. Detaining her in that instance was the sensible choice.

>But hey, there’s a chance, through the philosofh of the unknowablenature of subjectivity, that this woman could actually be behaving in such a way due to her own free will, right?

Definitely not. Free will itself is an entirely different discussion, but it is something none of us possess. 

>Your first 2 rules are completely arbitrary, and the third one suffers from the very problem you think you know about (but don’t really): who is going to decide ""when someone’s actions will cause harm to others"", as if we were living in Minority Resort?

The first two rules are indeed arbitrary, due to the arbitrary nature of determining when someone becomes an adult. We still use the concept of adulthood past 18 years of age in society for many things despite that.

In the first rule, intervening based upon arbitrary measures is justified because it pertains to the harm of another person. I also think most people under 18 depend on their parents to some degree. 

I didn’t word the second rule well at all. What I meant is that we should intervene if someone under the age of 18 wants to commit suicide, but only to prevent them from doing so. Once it is reasonable to believe suicide is no longer a threat, they should be free. 

This Is justified by the fact that children’s brains are not fully developed, which could be an influencing factor in their choice. It is ultimately arbitrary nonetheless. 

Regarding the third rule, we already detain people involuntarily for being a threat to others. We would use the same measures we use currently to determine such. Although improvement upon our guidelines is something we should always work towards. 

>Suicide intent due to mental illness is not the same thing as the request for the compassionate ending of a life through euthanasia, and you’re attempting to conflate them. Only in the latter is free will preserved.

I am not attempting to conflate them. Suicide is a decision that logically cannot be the wrong one, because it cannot be regretted after it is taken. I would also point out that life operates upon the universal interest to avoid suffering; death seems to do a good job at serving that interest, by ceasing the experience of suffering.

You are the sole person who pays the consequences for your own life. Keeping someone alive against their will is immoral; you are forcing them to endure something which causes them suffering, which doesn’t pertain to anyone but them, on the basis that they are irrational and thus don’t know what is good in terms of their own interests.

You ought to have an objective reason. One that contends with the fact that suicide cannot be the wrong choice, because it aligns with our interests and cannot be regretted. 

With the aforementioned exceptions, anyone should be able to commit suicide for any reason, including one so minuscule as ""I stubbed my toe.""

Free will is not preserved in any case, because it does not exist.",1

"(24Y/O) been on 50mg -> 100mg -> 150mg sertraline for the past 3 years, recently decide to resolve sertraline intimacy issue with psychiatrist. 

psychiatrist decided to wean off sertraline and increase brintellix slowly.

sertraline went from 150mg -> 125mg -> 100mg -> 50mg -> 0mg

5mg brintellix introduced at 50mg sertraline. 
10mg brintellix currently without any sertraline.

never felt so intense since 3 years ago.

easily triggered, irritable, annoyed. very snappy. partner getting affected by it and i feel bad. 

i believe the initial sertraline reduction made me a little less motivated/happy, but the cut off at 50mg and 0mg was the hardest. 
coupled with the very low 10mg brintellix, my mood has been insane the past month. 
i only realized it today how terrible it was, especially to my partner. 

my partner says recently im always hot/cold or happy/angry and i genuinely feel terrible, along with the fact even i dont know what specific thing might trigger me to go insane that specific day. 

im genuinely very very frustrated and i hate the lack of control over my emotions, and feeling everything so intensely. 
alongside that, the low dosage doesnt help with my lack of motivation and its gotten so so much worse. 

i genuinely cant get myself to start stuff, much lesser than when i was on sertraline. 
i have an ADD testing soon but motivation was slightly better on sertraline. 

i really wanna give brintellix a run, ive heard great things, but i dont know is it worth or if it will get better. 

would asking my doctor about wellbutrin + sertraline combo instead be safer?

my main concerns are lack of libido and excessive hunger/ weight gain.. 

i just feel that the grass around me is doused in fuel, and im just lighting and tossing matches around hoping that it doesnt land or the fire isnt big. 

extra: im prescribed .25 xanax, but im really afraid of taking it as i worry about being addicted to it. doctor's note is to take as needed but not more than 4x a week.

"Hi, everyone. I'm coming here for support, advice, and any tips or info concerning my quitting Prozac.

**The short version:** I've been on generic fluoxetine for almost 10 years, up to 40 mg per day for the past six years or so. I did contact my doctor to get advice about quitting, and she suggested just going cold turkey. It's been one week since my last dose, and symptoms haven't really started yet. I also have a prescription for .25 mg alprazolam (Xanax) tablets that I take only intermittently for panic attacks, and I'm on birth control hormones to regulate my menstrual cycle.

Edit: I said this in the comments, but I'll say it here, too: My psychiatrist is pretty much just collecting a paycheck. She's always been dismissive of me, and never really does anything but throw pills at me. When I discussed the side effects I was having, her solution was to up my dose. When I told her about the crippling insomnia, she said, ""Maybe you don't need that much sleep."" On the day I spoke with her, I had been awake for almost three days straight. I just started crying when she said that, and she just continued down the checklist. ""Any suicidal thoughts? Any feelings of restlessness?"" And when I told her I was having suicidal thoughts, she just checked the box and moved on.

During this last appointment, I sent her some information on tapering Prozac and she didn't even read it. Unfortunately, she's the only person I can see right now in my network. Everyone else has a waiting list months long, and the out-of-network doctors I've contacted won't take new patients or have even longer waiting lists. Tapering is not an option for me right now. And I can't live with the side effects. I got so desperate for sleep that I was considering drinking, and I'm allergic to alcohol. I can't stay on this stuff anymore, certainly not for months while I try to find a doctor who will listen to me.

I've seen the Surviving Antidepressants site. I didn't like what I saw. People are so desperate to avoid symptoms of withdrawal that they taper for years. I don't want to do that. I'd rather go through the withdrawal and come out clean than flirt with it for a few years and reinforce my dependence on it.

**The long, LONG version:** Ten years ago, I was having frequent panic attacks, nightmares, flashbacks, and freakouts. I went to a mental health center hoping that I could talk to a therapist, but a doctor there just gave me a prescription for 10 mg Prozac. It helped for a few months, but when it stopped working, I saw another doctor who changed my prescription to another SSRI. I had a terrible reaction to it, so she switched me twice more with much the same results. She eventually put me back on Prozac, this time at 20 mg. After that, I switched doctors again, and she upped my dose to 40 mg. This is the same doctor I'm seeing now.

I never really felt as if the Prozac was doing anything, but I stayed on it because I was afraid of any possible withdrawal symptoms. I frequently forgot to take it, and would suffer wild mood swings (keeping in mind that when I forgot to take the Prozac, I was also forgetting my hormones). Over the past few years, though, several things have changed that have had me contemplating quitting.

First, I did see a therapist about five years ago. She helped me to sort through things that were causing me PTSD, and with the therapy program, the nightmares and flashbacks went away. She also diagnosed me with autism spectrum disorder. I learned that I am prone to stimulus overload and also suffer from misophonia, and my panic attacks have almost completely stopped through management of those issues. I finally feel as if we've really gotten to the root of my problems, and my life has been vastly improved by learning these things about myself.

Second, I began to suffer from intense insomnia starting a few years ago. Even though the nightmares ceased, it was like I just could not fall asleep no matter what I did. My doctor prescribed various sleep aids, none of which worked. Sleeping pills of various strengths and preparations, melatonin, valerian... I even got desperate enough to try NyQuil. They would all do the job of making me drowsy, but I still could not fall asleep, nor could I stay asleep for more than four hours at a time. I did notice, though, that whenever I would forget my medications, I would fall asleep and stay asleep much more easily. The last time I ""went off"" of my meds, I did have intense side effects, but I was able to sleep at night.

The insomnia exacerbated my feelings of fatigue, so most days I was on auto-pilot. I would sleep all day and stay up all night. My sex drive had been plummeting for a while, and I lost the ability to exercise. After having covid, I've been left with shaky hands and dizziness that occur intermittently. I also have IBS caused by anxiety, and that got worse, as well. I had trouble losing weight despite being on a strict diet and exercise program. I began to think that all of these things were connected after they all improved when I forgot my meds.

I asked my doctor about quitting, and she said that she had no objection. She advised that I most likely would not need to taper doses because of fluoxetine's long half-life and the fact that withdrawal symptoms often occur even with tapered doses.

It's been one week since my last dose of Prozac. I know that it's too early for withdrawal to kick in, but I am already experiencing dizzy spells and slight nausea. The insomnia, though, has stopped. I really do believe now that the Prozac was causing it. Because I'm still taking my hormone pills, my mood has remained stable, unlike the times when I forgot my meds. My sex drive has started to go back to normal, and my hands are steadier. I never even thought to connect the shaking hands to Prozac until they improved this week, though that may have nothing to do with anything.

As I mentioned, I have a prescription for Xanax that I take for major panic attacks. I don't take it often, but now and then it helps to calm me down when other methods aren't working. I'm wondering if it will be a viable option for easing withdrawal symptoms if and when they begin. My doctor said, ""I don't see why not,"" but couldn't offer much more insight than that. Any ideas on taking Xanax or a similar medication for SSRI withdrawal?

I feel lucky to have the support system that I do. My husband and I live with my parents, and I have three people in the house to help me if symptoms get bad. I want to do this now, because my mom is most likely going to have knee replacement surgery soon, and she'll need my help to recover. I also help to take care of my dad, who is disabled (he's diabetic, had a stroke two years ago, and needs general help around the house), and I'd like to get this all over with so I can keep helping him. My husband is very proactive about helping my parents, but he works full time and I don't want to ask him to pitch in more than he already does (he keeps up with the yard and runs errands for the household).

I guess my major worry is that I'll be somehow unable to do my job, which is to cook and clean for everyone and help my dad around the house and with business. There are four adults living here, but I don't want to put more on them than I have to. They all know that I'm going off of Prozac, and I gave them the rundown of symptoms as given to me by my doctor.

I know I'll just have to wait and see how badly I'm affected, but I'm sort of hoping that someone can give me an idea of how debilitating withdrawal might be. Like, at its worst, what can I expect? Does anyone have experience with taking Xanax or a similar medication to help with SSRI withdrawal? Anyone else have any tips or advice or just a shared experience? If you made it through all of this, thank you for reading. I think posting this helped ease some of my anxiety already.",1
"I am currently 14 and I’ve been on Effexor for 2 years.

"Hey everyone so back around September I started getting these weird phases of being really light headed and my vision was blurry and I felt so weak and my heart rate was through the roof but after a few hours it would be gone for a few days even up to weeks. I put it down to me being under stress and I was under a lot of stress at the time. After about a month or two these symptoms came back again and this time I got it checked out as they lasted way longer than they ever have before.

The day I was going to my doctor I didn’t sleep the night before as my sleeping schedule was so messed up. I decided to get a taxi to the town and all of a sudden I started to feel really nauseous and shaky and it felt like there was something heavy on my chest, I told the taxi driver to bring me to my moms house where I started shaking uncontrollably and i just got that feeling where it felt like I couldn’t get a full breathe and it was so scary. Her friend/next door neighbour used to be a healthcare worker and she came in and helped me through it and gave me a xanax which seemed to help after a while and she told me that it was a panic attack or anxiety attack that I was having. I kept getting these for a few days and then they stopped out of the blue but the feeling of not being able to get a full breath didn’t stop but I’d only get it when I had to leave the house or go somewhere that i knew I wasn’t gonna be going back home soon if that makes sense.

I have always been anxious before but never medicated for it and I had never experienced a panic attack until that moment.

I explained this to my main doctor and he didn’t give me anything he just told me to do some research and go to counselling. Fast forward a few days and I saw another doctor and talked about it and I told her that I’m genuinely afraid to leave my house because of the fear of it happening again and she put me on sertraline (which I found out is another name for Zoloft)

I’m on it 6 weeks at the moment. She started me on 25mg for 2 weeks and then 50mg for 2 weeks and then go back to her and we can go from there. I noticed at around my second week I left to walk with my grandmother for the first time since the panic attacks

I felt a bit better after a few days I wasn’t as anxious but I knew that it takes around 6 weeks for full effect. When I went to 50mg I was getting really depressed and I was getting heart palpitations and shortness of breath out of nowhere so I spoke to her about this and I went back to 25mg and I was okay for a few days after but in the past maybe 2-3 days I’ve noticed that I don’t really feel as happy as last week. I don’t feel depressed but I don’t feel happy if that makes any sense and I’m getting the feeling of not being able to get a full breath again even when I’m home and i know I’m safe. I haven’t had a panic attack since 3 days after I had my first one which was over a month ago but tonight I felt one coming on again (I think it’s because I’ve been in pain all day with a broken tooth and no dentist is open and it was stressing me out)

The point of me making this post is to ask does it really get better. I know I haven’t been on Zoloft for long enough to really judge by myself but I’m just not able to do anything. I haven’t went out to any friends or anything since the panic attacks began. I have been out to get a haircut or just in the shops and I got the breath feeling which made me not want to get a haircut and just get a taxi home but I stuck through it and got it done and after a while the feeling went and I stayed in town for about another hour.

 I just feel like I don’t wanna leave my house for an extended period of time where as before I used to go out to a bar with friends or I used to always go shopping with my grandmother or I even used to go fishing but now I feel like I don’t wanna do any of these things I hate the feeling of not being able to get a full breath and I’m scared I’ll have a panic attack again.

My doctor told me Zoloft should help with panic attacks by bringing down my anxiety in general but I don’t think it’s really working for me and it makes me think will all antidepressants be the same? I’m really sorry for the long post but I’m just so lost recently, I hate being inside but I don’t wanna leave because of how I feel. I’ve even cancelled dentist appointments to get an extraction and a filling because I was too anxious to leave the house incase of an attack",1

"I've been struggling with a severe anxiety disorder and panic attacks for the last 10 years. In 2014, when they first appeared I was taking Deanxit for 3 months and it did wonders! It cured me for a stable 6 years in which I experienced an absolutely normal life. However, in 2020 after having covid for the first time all of that progress disappeared and I was back with panic attacks and severe anxiety. I took Flupentixol for 3 months - once again, back on track. In late 2021, my symptoms returned again so I was prescribed Escitalopram (Essobel) and this is where my nightmare begins. I had such difficulty surviving on this drug, it made me feel like I drank at least 50 coffees, shakes, extreme nervousness. I was taking Xanax to push through these initial side effects, but the moment I had to increase the dosage it became even worse, so I stopped taking it. Again, it managed to do some good, cause I was okay for at least half a year - and then bam, covid again. After which, the severe anxiety and panic attacks were back, I took Deanxit - it made me feel worse this time! Extreme vertigo, I was crying aaaaall the time for no reason at all, switched it to Flupentixol for just a week and it fixed me for a couple of months. 2024 in April - I've felt random tension and a bit of anxiety again and took Flupentixol and it made me feel so weird, so numb, a bit depersonalised, in general didn't work at all this time????? and I had to stop it. I've had mostly okay moments since then until this summer, after random covid AGAIN, everything turned to shit. I had severe vertigo, extreme derealizarion, shakes, anxiety, I couldn't even walk without my heart pounding out of my chest. I can't eat or sleep properly. For a whole month I had no idea where I am, I still struggle with the effects of the derealizarion. I was prescribed Etifoxine, managed to take it for 10 days while experiencing that extreme nervousness again, as if I drank 80 coffees. Because of that my doctor changed it to Zoloft, I took only 1/4th of it and it made me feel insane for days! Low BP, extreme nervous after that, extreme derealizarion. I haven't taken it anymore after but at this point I'm desperate, as it seems that I have some sort of intolerance towards antidepressants and I feel worse every day. I got Flupentixol prescribed again, but I'm even scared to take it because of that very bad numbness that I experienced this year. It seems that nothing is working and I'm very very desperate and scared that I'll be like that forever. I don't even know what's real anymore and if my life before this period wasn't actually just a dream, it's so weird. I feel like all of those meds kinda fried my brain, even though the dosage was really small and for a short period just to see if it's working for me. 

Did someone else experience this? What helped you? Is there even such thing as intolerance towards antidepressants? All of the doctors I've visited through the years are telling me the same thing - ""that it's just side effects, it's not normal from such small dosage? But some people are like that, so it's also normal? But it's also all in my head, I'm imagining it somehow and that's why I feel this way"" and none of that makes sense to me. ",1
"ive just started a two week prescription of klonopin while im adjusting to lexapro and i’ve noticed it makes me extremely forgetful and clumsy. it’s basically like my body is drunk but my mind is just kinda stupid. i have chunks of “lost time” where i have absolutely no memory of what i was doing or where i went, even though i know i did. it definitely helps with my anxiety but my body feels so heavy",1
"

I was prescribed Wellbutrin xl 150 on June 13th. I took the 150 for about 9 days and my dr told me to increase to 300 ( this was for general anxiety and to stop smoking). I started to feel weird that first day I increase but didn’t think much of it. The next day I was in a full blow spiral, this went on for 2 days.(I only was in 300 for 2 days) Heart palpitations, intrusive thoughts, despair , crying. I have NEVER been like that. I was this way for 2 days and had to leave work early both days. I talked to my doctor and was told I could stop. My last dose was Thursday June 20th. I felt great that Friday , was in bad shape Saturday, Sunday was amazing and I felt fantastic. Yesterday (Monday) I felt great again but around 3pm my mood shifted bad down significantly but I was still functioning and pretending to be good. This morning I’m pretty down still , uncontrollable cry and a feeling of despair. Is this normal for this type of rollercoaster to happen ?!? I feel like I’m going crazy. I have talked to a therapist , my mom, I just emailed my dr to see what this is about. I almost want to go to the ED to try and see if they can flush my system. I can’t believe 2 weeks of a medication could do this to me. I have a husband , I have a young child. I just want to be back to my old happy/ regular anxious self. please someone tell me there is a light at the end of this horrible black tunnel! This medication feels like a poison! I am so angry and I didn’t do my own research on this drug and that my dr prescribed it for me. I just want to be okay again. 

EDIT: I was given Xanax 1 mg yesterday to hopefully stop the panic attacks. I took one last night and it definitely calmed me down for the rest of the night. Felt happier . I also take buspar with it. I thought I would wake up feeling great but the symptoms are still there ( intrusive thoughts and chest pain / tightness). This is day 5 after my last dose of WB. This afternoon im feeling a bit better. I’m praying that I wake up tomorrow feeling 100% . I just want to feel happy and enjoy the 4th with my little boy. Will keep updated. 

2nd EDIT: I am feeling 100% again. That was 6 days of pure hell. The Xanax helped so much to get over the hump and I’m so happy to finally be back to myself again.",1
"Hi guys, I suffer from extreme anxiety/panic and depression and a little bit of ptsd. I currently take 300mg of Effexor and 2mg of Xanax XR every night but I'm always sleeping, I feel no motivation, I'm always sad, no happiness so my doctor added rexulti for me. I haven't taken it yet (waiting for insurance to cover it) but I was hoping to hear some success stories from taking rexulti",1
"I suffer from anxiety/depression and I’m currently on Effexor, Abilify and Xanax extended release. I’m sick of feeling like I’m constantly tired, like I’m a zombie and my personality changed. I’m not as social as I used to and I feel like it’s because of the meds. I have been on and off diff medications since I was 21 and I’m currently 32. So at this point I’m debating on talking to my doctor about getting off all meds and starting fresh but keeping the Xanax as an as needed thing incase I get a panic attack but I was wondering if anyone was or is in the same boat as me and if anyone has had any success being off of medication and feel better off of it?

"This is the first anti depressant i have ever been prescribed, and one of the only medications i’ve ever taken for anxiety. Granted ive only been on it for 2 days but man i feel weird as fuck. i was previously on a mix between hydroxyzine, propranolol, and xanax, after a panic attack led me to the er, but my new primary doctor said that i was over medicated. I’m only on 10 mg of paxil but the nausea is killer, my heart is racing, and i feel just overall worse. does this end after a few weeks of consistently taking it, or will these symptoms worsen? just looking for friendly advice and or personal experiences bc i HATE being nauseous and can’t deal with it forever ",1
So I have generalised anxiety disorder and depression. I was on so many medications before but with little to no effective. I am currently taking Wellbutrin 150 mg and Trintellix 20 mg and feel so much anxiety every day from dusk till dawn to the point where I get panic attacks and feel so awful and so stresfull. What should I do? I cannot take Xanax or Clonopin every day because they can cause addiction and stop working cause they are benzodiazapines. I was thinking to change Trintellix to Effexor Xr but my doctor tells me to give Trintellix a time... What should I do? ,1
"I was on 25mg Trazodone for 3 weeks then on 50 mg for one week. I also take 5 mg Lexapro and 15 mg Mirtazapinum. After one week of taking 50 mg of Trazodone I started having panic attacks after taking it.. so my dr said to stop it. However, the night I stopped it I could only sleep with Benzo and the night after I had a headache and shivering. So i figured this must be the withdrawal symptoms. How did you taper it off safely?

"When I was in high school I went through a lot of trauma. I got diagnosed with anxiety, PTSD and a little bit of psychosis when I was 19 I messed around with her cocaine, heroin mass and pill. I can get my hands on clean from that end up in a few psych wards now I’ve tried over 30 combination pills of antipsychotics and antidepressants over the years all of them call cause horrible side effects, I am going from one pill to another things of gotten 90% worse over the years. I’ve been on benzos like Klonopin Xanax etc since I was 18 I’ve been taking 3 mg daily of Klonopin prescribed a day for about 10 years. I’ve been taking 300 to 600 mg of Seroquel for 10 years. I’ve been taking every depressant in the book mainly was on Paxil for 10 years. Been trying to find something without side effects, how would I take steps into recovering if none of these pills are working and making me worse how would I go about the taper and where would I seek help and support because I lost most of my 20s due to all of this and now they label me as schizo effective when I feel like it’s a result of all the medication’s. I’ve been prescribed and pretty much. I’ve been two months sober off of weed and haven’t messed with hard drugs and years since 19 but I’m prescribed a hard drug, which is Clonopin 3 mg a day and then the antipsychotics and right now I’m going through antidepressant withdrawals and I’m at an end to where I really don’t know what to do what would be your steps to someone in my shoes is recovery possible if so, do I need to lose the career? I’ve built up while suffering this terrible life that I’d wish upon nobody thank you. At this point I’m afraid of everything and get minor panic attacks around any object etc ",1
Is it safe or is it a risk for cns depression? My question is about recommended doses (coaxil 3x12.5mg and 2/3x0.25 mg xanax) ,1
"so ive been to three different psychiatrists and all of them put me on medications that are at less than half of the normal starting dose. its hella annoying because i dont have any side effects and it always takes weeks till my next appointment. ive tried seroquel, lexapro, zoloft, xanax, ativan, klonopin, and all were prescribed wayy under the starting dose. ik its safer this way but i have bad issues and im desperate for something to help fast cuz all my teen years r bouta be gone. has anyone been prescribed benzos at a regular dose? any advice helps ",1
"So I was giving 50mg trazodone pills to help with anxiety and depression which I take before going to sleep. 4 days in I have started to experience strange effects in my mood. I was really hyper, I was speaking really fast and non stop, I’m a very to myself person so this was very strange to me. My brain was fried with the amount of things I was thinking of, I couldn’t keep up with it, im even spending lots of money on things I usually wouldn’t. I was very confident like I’m the best looking thing out there. Is that really a side effect of this medication? I think I’m ok now after 5 days of it. I was really embarrassed by my behaviour so I rang my doctor explained my symptoms and she prescribed me another medication called Xanax. I feel absolutely terrible right now, no energy, feeling of worthlessness and that I would be better off dead",1
"Hi all,

I was on several medications (Citalec, Mirtazapam, Xanax, Pragiola, Zalasta and Lamotrygine) and pretty early on I started seeing issues with my digestion and bowel movements. I had to just accept the side effects but now I’ve been off everything for about a month and I still continue to have these issues. Does anyone have experience with this ? Can side effects persist even after you stop taking the medication? ",1
"So I have GAD, MDD and ADHD inattentive type and have struggled for years to find a medication that works for all 3. 

I was on 20mg xr adderall for years as a teen-young adult and although that helped my adhd, it never addressed my anxiety. I then had children and haven’t been on adderall for 10 years. 

I do have a script for Xanax for panic attacks that I use as needed. But it’s super rare. I still have half a bottle that was prescribed back in 2017 that I use occasionally.

I’ve tried Wellbutrin, Effexor and Zoloft. 
Wellbutrin gave me tremors, Effexor made me feel good during the day but then I was up all night and wanted to puke after half a dose and Zoloft made me extremely dizzy. I’m so scared to try different medications and I quite frankly get too scared by side effects to move forward after a day or two if I feel weird. What I probably need to do is take a week off of work and just push through the side effects and see how I feel but I don’t have the time for that. 

Right now I just started adderall again to address my adhd. My psych said maybe if we address the adhd then my anxiety and depression might fall into place. Yesterday I took my first 10mg xr dose and I felt great during the day—not too jittery but definitely had motivation that I’ve been lacking. The bad part though is that I was up until 2am and I only fell asleep because I took a Xanax to calm me down. My anxiety was is overdrive. 

So this morning instead of taking another 10mgxr adderall I took a 5mg ir in hopes I can sleep tonight.


I guess my question is—those who have adhd and anxiety, what do you take??? 

Thank you.

"Hi everyone.

I've been taking lexapro 10mg 1 year because of pánic attacks. Until 28th january 2024

It worked really good, but in the 7th month I started to feel a bit weaker. And started to have sudden vision losses. My tinnitus started to be more noticiable in the second month more or less of the treatment

Went to ER and everything was all fine, ecg , brain TAC, Blood tests. 

Every time I took the pill i noticed palpitations 1h later, dizziness. But no serious tathycardias.

I had a full eco doppler of my heart before I started lexapro. Everything fine.

My pshychiatrist didnt care my Evolution... 

I loved when I could go outside, to pshycology sessions... 

Well on january 28th. I had the worse experience of my Life, I took the lexapro 5mg (almost 2 months un this dosage) I withdrawed It gradually 2,5mg each 2 months because i was feeling worse.

Well after 1h I noticed a severe balance sense alteration, when i was walking i felt that my body was leaning back. But just was a sensation.

3 minutes after that, i didnt git scared to much because i knew all the side effects. I was relaxing watching videos and suddenly I had a sudden strong breath loss for 3 second, was really different to anything I experienced, then I had a strange chest pressure that lasted 5 seconds. I've never felt something similar and I had pánic attacks. To finish I had blurry vision for a second with light sensitivity.

Important to know that between and after trying new antidepressants I had bruises in the body, they were yellow always and they dissapear really fast. When I have the reactions they appear more.

When I was good with lexapro... First 6 months , I experienced common side effects only.

Then they started zoloft 25mg 5 th of february, a week later. They told me as always take 25mg 7 days and then increase It to 50mg. I could follow this 1 week and 5 days. 

I had a side effects as tathycardia, i had a familiar sense of pánico attacks, but I wanted to follow , and follow but one day. 

Sudden tinnitus worsening in one ear, chest pressure 5 seconds, horrible and new headache, Fainting sensation, Strong palpitations, not really fast tathycardia, intense body sweating. After this, left part of body paralized I Lost the sensubility on that moment. My bp was high, like 158/95.

They sudden stopped zoloft.

After this I started to have similar episodes but only with tathycardia, similar bp. But horrible.

And started mirtazapine after 3 days, 7,5mg , two weeks after that I had an episode of tathycardia with weakness, sweating, tinnitus change due ti high bp. Always 150/90. 

I think the first episode with zoloft literally rocketed my bp more than i can tell. I couldnt measure It .

They also retired me abuptly mirtazapine. 

And they started on me bisoprolol 2,5mg

And I was a month and almost a half. At the withdrawal start With improvements , more cognitive capable, and feeling well. But then the tathycardia and bp variations continues and I felt more deppresed, less Energy, since started bisoprolol I have a constant shortness of breath. They decided to try on me 1,25mg. And yeah I felt more stable and no weird sensations on chest. No tathycardia in 2 weeks again. But I started to feel dizzy, and my sense of not enough breath got worse.

They tapered me off to 0,63 after 10 days with 1,25mg. And then I was 6 days on that dose.

My shortness of breath improved.

Then they started trazodone 50mg may 25th, one dose and I went to sleep and I slept only 3h, i woke up like i was drunk, and i fainted completely after going to the bathroom. I noticed a tinnitus of low bp , but i was asleep when I tried to react.

On ER, I had i think a pánic attack sleeping, and yeah I had the feeling that I started my tathycardia.

This time they forced me to do a Heart stress test after 2 days , and It was horrible, It was fine. But the results were worrying because i was a fit person 182cm 88kg 23 years old, I reached a hr of 190 never in my Life, only walking fast at the last moment, and after that i had a burning chest pain, it could be because of inactity... I insisted a lot. But the test showed good in the ecg, BP change. , i was really bad because all the meds. but never like this with trazodone. I used to walk a lot and play football.

When I returned from the hospitalization, 
I had several wake ups with fear and weird sensations similar to Fainting and chest soft pressures. But almost like a nightmare but awake.

I went to ER like 30 times in 3 months. Everything fine.

Right now I have sleep disorders, shortness of breath that has improved but there are tough moments. It doesnt get worse on movement, but yes on stress. And is horrible. 

Also suden Skipping Beats that I already had a lot of these. But sometimes i have a Strong one and I hace fear literally, headaches almost everyday, visual flies, light sensitivity. Sudden tathycardias but they have improved, and high bp 146/90. I cannot control these reactions, i let them happen...

People i am scared, I love this world... They studied me with many things. Is this normal. What I am feeling. 

Important to tell that I dont have external stress. I try to Focus on recovering. Also this is very different and weakening. It doesnt improve with benzos.

At least I take 1mg lorazepam night. Xanax 0,25 mg morning, and afternoon. They keep me calm.

If somebody can help me i would be really Happy and calm. 

A Big hug to everyone 🫂🥹❤️

I don’t know if it’s just the doctors I’ve had but they keep on saying ‘this will help with the depression as well as your anxiety’ when prescribing an antidepressant but they NEVER help w my anxiety. and when I say so they’re always like ‘hmm it should help w the anxiety’ I mean??? SNRIs did help my anxiety a little but they were too intense for me. why couldn’t they just cut the shit and prescribe my lorazepam and xanax rather than try to see if SSRIs work,1
"This happened a few years ago -- I had been seeing a specific psychiatrist since I was a teen, and was taking Lexapro for anxiety & depression. I was doing pretty good. 

One session (I was probably an adult at this point), out of the blue, she asks, ""Do you have trouble sleeping?"" I go, ""Uh, I guess??"" and she prescribed me Xanax.

I never took it, because my anxiety was pretty well-controlled by the Lexapro, so I never felt like I was in a bad enough place that I needed it. I could understand why it would be useful if I was in a very anxious state, but I just hadn't reached that place since the Lexapro so I just kept the Xanax around for an emergency.

But every time I met with my psychiatrist, it'd be, ""Have you tried it yet? Why haven't you taken it yet??"" and she would just be really pushy about wanting me to take it, even though my anxiety was very much under control. And the kicker is, when I still didn't take it after a while she said, ""Feel free to share it with your family."" She said times were stressful from the pandemic, so they could benefit too.

That seemed insane to me. From there I just kind of gradually stopped seeing her. 

First of all: how unethical is it really for a doctor to prescribe me a (highly addictive) drug that I don't need, and then to tell me to share it with my family, whose medical history she doesn't even know? To me this feels utterly insane, maybe even illegal, but maybe it's commonplace -- has anyone else experienced anything like this? 

Secondly: WHY would a doctor do this? From when she first prescribed Xanax, I sort of wondered if she was somehow in Big Xanax's pocket, or getting money from prescribing it -- but is that even a real thing? I have always been a huge proponent of meds for mental health and I don't believe in conspiracies or anything -- but what on earth would inspire a doctor to tell a patient to share a highly addictive controlled substance, and to be so pushy about them taking it? And if she really thought I needed it, why would she be telling me to share it?

I realized recently that this experience (as well as my experience of being on Lexapro since I was a tween without ever being explained any side-effects) has made me distrustful of psychiatrists, which will be no good as I try to fight the depression that has now overtaken the anxiety. I am still on Lexapro and have found a wonderful psychiatrist who has started me on Wellbutrin which has helped a lot. Still, my previous experience was a bonkers situation that I have only ever discussed in a joking manner, but I think it really screwed me up. Would love to hear your thoughts.",1
Currently I take Luvox and I think it’s making me more tired like couch lay all day tired,1
"I’ve been on Prozac for almost a year & while it started off rocky, these past 6 months have been a lot better for me. While I still have bad moments of anxiety/panic it usually doesn’t last long & im able to work through it. But recently, today especially, I’m feeling off. It’s just a really weird mental feeling that I'm not used to; I don't feel in control and almost like l'm going crazy or will spiral at an moment. It doesn’t feel like normal panicking/anxiety from what I’m used to. It feels like derealization. I took half of a .25 mg Xanax and I think it helped a little (or I’m convincing myself it did, but I’ll take it). Best way to describe this feeling is when you're drunk trying to get a grip on yourself and talk to yourself and say that you're okay and to stay in control, but you know you fully can’t. I have also been drinking more, usually every weekend and I drink liquor and usually get very tipsy each time. I’m sure that doesn’t help. I’d love any advice, reassurance, what’s worked for you/what hasn’t etc. Thank you. ",1

"I just wanted to share my experience after taking both medications. I am a 28 year old male. I’m a firefighter paramedic and I used to be fearless and always thought anxiety wasn’t real. But something changed and I’ve been dealing with anxiety for years now. I’m not sure if it’s after my dad passing or a form of PTSD. I don’t like to claim PTSD because I know military people get offended when others claim to have it. Although I didn’t fight for our country, I have seen a lot doing my career so who knows. As far as depression, I never thought that I had it and I’m still not sure if I do. I’ve always refused to take anti depressants and would just take a Xanax if absolutely necessary. I finally caved in and took 10mg of Lexapro daily for 2 months. I absolutely loved the Lexapro. I felt like a complete different person in a good way and everyone was constantly telling me how much happier I seem. Off of it I’m miserable and very difficult to get along with. Super negative, opinionated, and argumentative. The only side effects I had were difficulty falling asleep and after 2 alcoholic drinks I was drunk. I am a chronic drinker and can normally handle a TON of alcohol. I had 0 sexual side effects but I do take testosterone so I expected to not have those. However I still had some anxiety and I felt like an anti depressant wasn’t the answer so I stopped and tried Buspirone 5mg 3 times a day. From what I researched, it has less side effects with drinking and it is specifically for anxiety. I also missed being able to drink like I used to. That’s another issue I’m working on. Coming off of Lexapro was absolute hell. 0 side effects getting on, all the side effects getting off. I’ve been on Buspirone for 3 weeks and I absolutely hate it. I have the worst side effects and my doctor said they should be pretty much gone by now. I’m back to my old miserable self and I am calling it quits. I’m trying Citalopram next which my new doctor recommended over Lexapro. I was told that taking both Buspirone and a SSRI goes well together but I do not want to be in 2 psych meds. So my goal is to learn to manage my anxiety myself and stay on the anti depressant. The biggest take away from my experience is that you can’t base your decision on other people’s experience because medications affect people differently. For me, anti depressants seem to work best. Maybe I didn’t give Buspirone enough time but the side effects of starting it scared me away. I would rather be happier with a little anxiety over miserable but anxiety free.",1
"Hello, in on paxil 20 mg for 13 months already, it helped me alot, i feel 100 % good.  When i stopped smoking weed after 12 years daily cold turkey it messed me that i get anxiety, it was mild (high hr, palps, depresed it was bearable ) then there was a birthday party of my friend and i drink alot of strong alcohol, and used 2-3 lines of white, all was good i went home and went sleep, i wake up at night because of my heart rate 150-180 maybe more but it felt crazy, it was my first panic attack. And after this it went really bad, i was having panic attacks daily, i tried to recover myself for 1 month but its only get worse, anxiety was unbearable, all symptoms you name it, i was loosing my mind, i couldnt function at all. And then I realised that i need proffesional help, and they put me on paxil. First day of paxil use, it was a nightmare, i literally almost went insane ( not sure or its common) thanks god doc prescribed me a xanax to cope, my mother gave me half xany  and i felt a sleep next day was  better. (It was 0.25 mg of xanax)  i had alot of symptoms from paxil but they all faded away with  some time , the only one i have now its that im not gettin horny , like sex is not interesting for me,  everything works, i can ejeculate etc, not sure how to name it probably low libido , and also i feel sleepy when i need to drive  alot on a highway lol.  I was working with therapy,  back to work, gym,  fix my eating , sleeping habits,  dont do caffeine at all
Any kind, the only bad habit now i have its cigarettes. I feel good, so my doctor decide that we need to start tapering soon, but i read alot about ads and not sure or hes tapering plan ok, and also im not sure or im ready , will i feel okay without it? My pills are 20 mg , so he tells me to make 25% cuts,  20>15>10>5    Every 4-6 weeks. I read alot
About 10% tapering but im not able to do it with 20 mg pills, its also a struggle to make it to quarters.  What you think guys?",1
"I wasn't going to do an update post, but I've had several people DM me asking how it's going. Thought I'd share, in case this might help someone else going through the same thing. 

Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/13xvh0r/im\_quitting\_prozac\_cold\_turkey/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/13xvh0r/im_quitting_prozac_cold_turkey/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

TL;DR version: I quit Prozac cold turkey because it was causing too many side effects. I never really should have been on medication to begin with. Over a decade ago, I walked into a clinic asking to speak to a counselor, and instead was given Prozac. Every doctor I spoke with about Prozac not working would either up my dose or change me to a medication that made me even worse. Eventually, I was able to find a therapist and work through my PTSD, then received a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Since then, it's become apparent that the medication is doing nothing for me. 

&#x200B;

Update: 

Well, it's been almost six weeks since my last dose of Prozac. And honestly? I feel great! My insomnia has improved, and I'm now averaging about 7 hours of sleep a day. I've begun to work out more, and though my weight hasn't dropped any, I feel better overall. 

Symptoms of withdrawal began maybe two weeks out, starting with occasional brain zaps that were mild but irritating. Dizzy spells followed, and one day I had a headache that was severe enough that I needed to lie down for most of the day. That occurred at week 4. After that, things have mostly improved. The brain zaps have stopped. I still feel mildly dizzy most days, but it's manageable. Some days, I feel the brain fog, but I'm having more clear days than I did before stopping Prozac. 

The most surprising thing has been the discovery of things that I never knew were side effects. Primarily, my vision has improved and my hands no longer shake. In the case of the former, I hadn't even noticed how blurry things had gotten. With the shaky hands, that started after my second round of COVID-19, so I attributed it to that. My hands have been trembling pretty much constantly since I recovered, but stopping Prozac has made them steady again. Weird. 

Another thing was something I thought was a side effect, but hasn't gone away: Restless legs at night. I eat a pickle and it goes away, but I'm surprised that it's not the Prozac doing this. Then again, restless legs are also a symptom of withdrawal, so perhaps it's just more of the same. Who knows?

I'll be honest, I feel that I'm not out of the woods yet. I know that Prozac withdrawal symptoms can take a while to show up. In my first post, I was inundated with horror stories and warnings. But I feel so good now that it's difficult to imagine going back on the meds. I'm actually able to sleep, which has improved almost every other aspect of my life; and my dark thoughts have stopped. I used to fantasize about dying - not killing myself, but just not having to go on anymore. I used to worry incessantly about my loved ones dying. That has tapered off almost entirely. I no longer obsess about those thoughts. When they appear, I can easily let them fade again. They don't seem to have the same hold on me that they did before. I no longer cry in the bathroom at night because I can't stop freaking out about death. 

I know that others have experienced far worse when it comes to withdrawal. I'm grateful that I'm not experiencing anything too severe, and I understand that I may in the future. But I'm even more convinced now that this was the right decision. Even if things get rough for a while, I'm going to ride it out. I feel free, for the first time in ten years! I feel like I'm more myself now.

Medication can save lives. My husband is bipolar, and medication is vital to his everyday functioning. But please, don't feel that it will solve all of your problems. I should never have listened to that first doctor all those years ago. I knew that I needed a therapist, but I was so young and naive that I thought I should just listen to him without question. If you take anything away from this post, let it be this: Advocate for yourself. The mental health profession is full of people who will just throw pills at you and see what sticks. Sometimes, they're right; but it never hurts to get another opinion from a counselor or therapist. There are some things that cannot be fixed with medication.

That being said, I am still on Xanax for intense panic attacks. When the tools I learned in therapy don't work, Xanax calms me down. But I like that it doesn't really stay in my system. I take it so sparingly that it doesn't have time to build up at all. my dose is .25 mg and I've taken it only once since going off of Prozac. But when I need it, it helps a lot. So, even then, medication is part of my toolset for managing my mental health. Sometimes, you just need the right meds in the right doses. ",1
"i have not felt this sick so consecutively for a long time. started paxil about 2 years ago. 20mg > 30mg > 60mg. 60mg is the highest dose so i had to stick w that. medicine was great, treated my ocd wonderfully, however i gained 50+/- lbs on it and i finally decided to taper off. i finally got down to 20mg daily and i am suffering. i’ve had to call out of work, i cannot get out of bed, can’t get up in mornings, im dizzy, have vertigo, nauseas, anxious and my ocd is off the charts i can barely function. anyone had to do the same w paxil? when did it finally stop? i cant keep living like this, i feel so unproductive. i have sm anxiety i can’t move. cant move too fast bc i’ll get dizzy. my psych prescribed busiprone while i get off paxil but it hasn’t kicked in yet. i also take PRN xanax and organic supplements for ADHD bc i can’t have stimulants. also had no idea what i was getting into when i started paxil until i missed a day of my 60mg dose due to me failing to fill a script on time. almost went to urgent care until i did more research and learned paxil is one of the hardest to get off of.",1
"I developed depression after messing with MDMA, which microscopic photographic brain imaging before and after pics prove that even after 1 time of using this drug empties out your serotonin completely and not even after 7 years it doesn't go back to normal, but my serotonin receptors did go back to normal since I haven't used MDMA for 5 years, was on Zoloft for 3 years, then Cymbalta and Trittico for 2 years, took 5-HTP plenty of times, and after I quit these medications I took pure tested ibogaine in a psycho stabilization clinic in Serbia. Iboga is a drug that heals your brain completely in only 3 days and fixes all of the damages that drugs have created in your brain's receptors, my doctor recommended me to go to that clinic, and it was the best choice I ever did. 

After the ibogaine I feel better than ever, all of my depression and anxiety is gone and I'm stronger than ever and hard like a rock. On top of that I quit nicotine which I really wanted to, quit meat/milk/cheese/eggs/sugar, and insured that I'm never gonna take devil drugs like LSA, shrooms, kratom, xanax etc ever again. 

I reduced my THC intake without my doctor's permission, my doctor is telling me to take 10 drops of THC oil a day, but instead I take 1 drop of THC oil every 3 days, I feel like I don't need it anymore, kept it in a small amount though because it does have a lot of health benefits, I use CBD regularly, I love CBD and I recommend it to people who have depression, but only high quality CBD that you actually feel an effect, not that enecta and other ""CBD oils"" that don't do nothing except waste your time and cash... 

I would definitely recommend CBD way more than chemical antidepressants, but if you like your antidepressants I won't judge you, I liked Cymbalta also, but it had so many side effects I couldn't keep it... Plus was very hard to get off it... 

I also recommend going for psycho stabilization at a clinic like the Dr Vorobiev Clinic in Serbia, they use natural supplements, stem cells infusions, xenon gas, ibogaine, psychotherapy and special massage, to bring you back to normal, and it works, it's pretty expensive though...

Been stuck in my room for 13 days with virus, had fever for 1 day and a little high temperature for 5 days and chest pain, also a very clogged nose, irritated eyes, tickly throat, and skin rash, but I went through it well, used many natural immune system boosters which I can't name here because it's not allowed to give virus treatment advice but managed it very well, and I'm mostly proud of myself of how I managed it psychologically, I'm stuck in 1 room for 13 days which I've never done before yet I'm so happy, I thought I was gonna get so bored and depressed about not going out, but I don't mind at all actually, iboga made me hard as a rock. Plus I'm happy because I convinced my family to get a pet Sunglow Boa.

I feel like God is on my side. I wanted to get virus anyways so I'm able to move around restaurants/bars/clubs without needing to take a nose-hurting rapid test, I knew it wasn't that serious, but I would had preferred to catch the O instead of the D, but oh well, that's what you get for regularly partying in indoor clubs. It was a matter of time to get it. In case you wondered how I went in the clubs, I'm good friends with most bodyguards from the clubs in my city so they secretly pass me inside and in case of police checks I get out from the back door... anyways, all good fratellis, cheers

The main reason of the post was to recommend doing ibogaine, but ONLY in a medical hospital as it is a psychologically extreme medical procedure. The hospital will cut off your medication completely for at least 2 weeks before the ibogaine. I also recommend quality-CBD tea. CBD is an antidepressant and ibogaine is a cure for many mental illnesses including depression if used correctly.",1
"I have severe anxiety/panic disorder with some depression. I stopped medication last year by myself, I started working out, eating better and I felt so much better. Significantly but then 8-10 months down the road, I got worse and started getting anxiety disorder and depression again so got put back on anti depressants and anti anxiety. Idk if I’m better on or off medication and it scares me to keep trying to find out but I’m back on the meds for almost a year and still have severe anxiety and I lack interests. I used to love working out, watching funny tv shows, puzzles etc but I don’t anymore. Maybe the medicines that I take (Prozac, buspar,clonodin) don’t work anymore? Idk I’m confused 

The only pill that I take every night that makes me feel “normal” is Xanax

I need some advice on whether are not anti depressants and anti anxiety meds help tremendously or make you worse? And if they help, which ones do you guys take ? 

My brain is all over the place and I’m very confused",1
"I’m struggling with alcohol and anxiety. I don’t know if that is making me want to quit my lexapro or if it’s all in my head and I need to continue with my lexapro. I know I need to give up alcohol. I must and will. But, I also want to cold Turkey my lexapro at the same time. Is this okay to do? Any experience with just going cold off everything. Lexapro, alcohol, weed, Xanax. I just want it all out of my life, but I’m genuinely struggling with will power.  My anxiety gets so bad, I have to take the edge off somehow. I broke out in hives this morning all over my back chest and upper back. I genuinely don’t know if it’s from stress/life style or a reaction to something I ate. For context, I’m on month 5.5 and 10mg of lexapro.

Edited to add : I take vyvanse as needed 10mg. Usually about 3 times a week",1
"
This is by far the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. Putting this out there to see if anyone else has had similar experiences or shed any light on this.


First of all, I am a 34 year old male with a history of drug abuse. In my twenties I only partied a couple times a month and did everything from MDMA to Molly to mushrooms to acid, so on and so forth. Was also a devout weed smoker. In my late twenties/early thirties I became a benzo popper and cokehead. The coke use was only about 3 or 4 times a month but it was heavy. So heavy that I'm amazed I'm alive right now. The pills led to an overdose and after that 3 month ordeal was behind me I tried my best to stay clean. With only a small handful of exceptions, I did.


So I've been clean for a few years now. All I use is kava, kratom and very conservative amounts of weed - mainly because it still gives me high anxiety when I do too much. It's really just meant as a topper for the other herbs.


So this experience happened about two year ago. I was going through a particularly difficult time in my life. My long-time partner had found someone else and moved out. It really hit me hard. So I started taking Xanax again when this happened. Prior to this, I hadn't taken it in at least 4 years. The xanax use only lasted a little while, but all the while I was quite sad. Diet was shit. Sedentary. Lifestyle habits were out of whack.


A buddy of mine came to visit me for a week and we decided to do ecstasy. I had not done E in over 5 years and my dealer warned me that this stuff was particularly potent. The time had come and I ended up taking only ONE-FOURTH of a pill. I wanted only a taste. WORST CHOICE OF MY LIFE. My other buddies were having the time of their lives but I was in hell. I didn't get any of the loving, happy or positive effects that I used to when I was younger. It just felt like every nerve in my body was on fire and I was spiraling out mentally. I felt over-stimulated, not good. My friends had to babysit me and try to talk me through the horrendous experience.


It took about 32 hours to really start feeling ""normal again"", but after a day or two had passed I realized I still didn't feel quite right. I was just on edge and a little bit sensitive. I could function but this weird feeling was still there.


After about 3 or 4 days, all of a sudden, I stopped sleeping. The first night I thought it was just ""one of those nights"" that everyone has from time to time. Can't drift off, mind racing. The next night the same thing happened and I started to worry. So I took one of the last xanax I had and STILL couldn't sleep. For those of you out there who have used benzos, you know this is HIGHLY irregular. Benzo use almost always ends in passing out. But it had no effect on me that night. The following night I managed to fall asleep for about an hour and had some of the most intense night terrors of my life. I'd had bad dreams before but these were different. Hyper-realistic and full of horror and dread.
This insomnia went on for about 4 or 5 days until I could hardly function and was forced to take a leave of absence from my job. At this point I was high off sleep deprivation. I tried everything in my power to sleep but nothing worked. You name is - sleepy tea, chamomile, kava, kratom, weed, wine, booze, stuffing myself with junk food until I was sleepy. None of it did anything. I was scared so I made a doctor appointment for the following week.


With this insomnia, other symptoms started popping up. My muscles were jerking randomly. Not twitching, but jerking. All over, all the time. Little jerks I could feel and that would often startle me if I was sitting still. But the most debilitating symptom that had reared its ugly head was temperature sensitivity. It was the strangest thing I'd ever experienced. I'd be cold all the time but my skin was so sensitive I couldn't bear it. What's worse is that I am a heavy sweater and every time I'd sweat it felt like someone was scraping my skin with icicles. I know this sounds dramatic and embellished but I swear it's not. It all got so bad that I wasn't leaving my apartment. At all. Couldn't work, could hardly go outside. One of my good buddies tried dragging me out insisting that this was all in my head and I just needed to leave my immediate surroundings and put myself in a better headspace. He definitely wasn't wrong, but each time he took me out it was excruciating due to the constant sweating, chills and sleeplessness. After just a couple times of trying I gave up and stayed in my apartment completely.


My doctor appointment finally arrived. I explained all of this to my doctor. He checked me out, took blood, and conducted his examination. Ultimately he found nothing wrong. He said this was a physical manifestation of the depression I was going through and that ""it's not going to be easy being newly separated from my life partner of a decade"". He prescribed me Ambien and Lexapro. He told me to start taking the Ambien but that I should think about the Lexapro, explained the side effects, and told me that it's my call to make but he wanted me to have access to it should I want to try.


After a few more weeks of this absolute torture, I decided to try the Lexapro. I didn't know what else to do. I was scared that this was never going to stop, I wouldn't be able to go back to work, I'd become homeless, etc. The Ambien barely worked. I had to take double doses just to be knocked out for no more than 2 hours, after which I could not get one wink of sleep. I hadn't experienced deep sleep in more than a month. I was terrified. So I started.


Weeks went by, nothing was changing. I remained terrified and unable to work. Kept extending my leave of absence over and over. And then finally after one month and ten days, the Lexapro kicked in and in that moment my life was saved. I went to bed that night and actually slept. My energy came back. I could function again. I got up and cleaned my apartment. Went outside. It was literally my saving grace.


So I stayed on 10mg for about 4 or 5 months but all the while I was still taking large doses of kava which I quickly learned interfered with Lexapro. The drug started failing so I discontinued the kava use and upped my dose to 20mg. Haven't had a problem since. Here I am two years later still on 20mg and things have bounced back to normal (if not better with the help of the medicine).


Why did all of this happen to me? I feel like the fact that a serotonin-increasing drug fixed all of this proves that it was all due to a serotonin deficiency. That's just a theory, of course, as I am not a doctor and don't understand how brain chemistry works. But I really want to know exactly what did this to me. My hypothesis: the ecstacy tried forcing out serotonin that wasn't there and essentially ""broke the serotonin pump"". Kind of like trying to drive with no gas so you damage the car. Does this sound correct? Does anyone have any guesses, theories or anecdotes to offer?


Thanks so much for reading my little manifesto here. Very interested in what everyone thinks.",1
"I have severe panic disorder. Still trying to find the best medication after I stopped cold turkey last year. So right now I’m on effexor, clonodine and buspar. I was taking Xanax every night but it stopped working for me so instead of increasing, my doctor wants to switch me to Valium bc it lasts longer. I’m scared to take it because I read that it could be fatal if you’re taking other medication that slows your heart rate (I should have never googled) but I just want to know if anyone else takes Valium with other meds? Or just take Valium in general and if so, how is it? I need to hear positive things before I try it bc I’m scared",1
Hello. I have been taking Trezadone for few weeks and mostly it was okay. No big problems. Feeling better etc. Alongside with threzadone I was sometimes taking 0.25 Xanax. Two days ago I took my pill and went to sleep. I started to hear ringing in my ear and had some mild hallucinations. Yesterday there was no ringing in my year so I thought it wasn't something serious. But at evening I took Trezadone again and the ringing started again. Worst part is that it did not wear off. I still hearing that fucking high pitched ringing. It sounds like turning on really old TV. Do you think it could be caused by Trezadone? Should I stop taking it for few days? I take it mostly for sleep so I dont think my anxiety could get much worse since I think that this ringing shit makes my anxiety 10 time worse than it was.,1
"I don’t know if this is to vent or what but here goes. 
First time poster. I am a 35 year old male and was diagnosed with MDD as a 15 year old. I was given Zoloft and all was well. For some unknown reason, the family doctor switched all of us (My whole family has clinical depression to varying degrees) to Effexor XR when I was 19. Still, it controlled my depression so I was fine with it. 
In 2015 I caught a really, REALLY severe case of Viral Meningitis that caused severe encephalitis. All my EEGs were wildly abnormal and I was completely nuts, totally out of touch with reality. This experience completely fried my brain. They never discovered the identity of virus that caused the infection but I was hospitalized for over a month while my medical team hoped the virus would clear and the swelling around my brain would normalize. It eventually did and I was discharged home. The recovery out of the hospital was worse than my scattered memories of my time in the hospital. I physically could not fall asleep and after three weeks of begging was finally given Trazadone (thank God) along with my steady stream of my newly prescribed opioid pain killers and Valium. Over the next two months I slowly recovered from the worst of it. I got off the opioids but still take trazadone to this day. I went back to work and tried to begin life again. 

However, I was not the same person I was before the meningitis. Anxiety (which had never been a problem for me before) joined my depression, which sadly was no longer responding to the Effexor. I found a great psychiatrist and we have tried almost everything with no effect. Welllbutrin, Zoloft again, Seroquel,Mirtazapine, Lamictal, Pramipexole, Lexapro, pretty much everything under the sun. The next two years was just a roller coaster of meds and shitty side effects. I eventually was given Xanax which at least kept me functional despite the fact I am completely chemically dependent on it now. I did a whole round of TMS and felt nothing. I am now classified as “Treatment Resistant.”

My psychiatrist is frustrated and said to me that beyond a few more drugs and possibly MAOIs, ECT is where we are headed. I am not against ECT but I am absolutely just exhausted fighting this battle. It’s been seven years living like this. I make it to work and excel there but I feel like I have withdrawn from life. I was always the social butterfly but now I just sleep my weekends away. I recently started going back to therapy and am doing ketamine infusions but I just feel stagnant and I can’t see myself doing this forever. I don’t want to die but I definitely don’t want to continue living like this. 

In addition to my Effexor, Trazadone and Xanax my psychiatrist just prescribed me Caplyta, which is relatively new and based on what I have read, used primarily for Bipolar Depression. I pray to God it works because I don’t want to just exist anymore. I want to get back to living my life. 

Does anyone have positive experiences with ECT? Is there something I have missed? I feel like I am running out of road here. Any outside insight would be welcome.",1
Well I got prescribed clonazepam now I’m hooked been 2 years can’t stop taking them. Xanax is even worse,1
I’ve been taking Xanax as needed for eight years now. It’s very helpful. Only when I’m feeling high anxiety and/or sleep issues. Never multiple days in a row. My dosage has stayed at 0.5. Hope this helps quell some of the extreme horror stories,1
You take one and everything’s fine. You take two and you wake up the next morning with your neighbours barbecue and dog in your back yard because you stole them in your sleep,1
Addiction would be my worry,1
"I took xanax for sleep for years. I had my doctor switch me to klonpin because its longer acting. Xanax is meant to relax you and help with sleep to turn off your brain.  If all you are using it for is sleep,  you shouldn't have any issues. However,  medication affects everyone differently",1
"It's extremely hard to get off Xanax. Been there, done that",1
"Shit, doesn't sound right. Maybe there's not enough stigma in here, I think it is one of the most prescribed for sleep or things like anxiety. The problem is I can't know before how I'm going to react to it so idk how to move",1
wait you got panic attacks because of xanax?,1
Basically what I've been hearing is that is not recommended for sleep but for anxiety. My psychiatrist is pretty reccomended and she felt like a good fit for me so I think I might give it a try? Idk I don't want to add problems,1
"I would kidnapp the neighbours dog even without it. 
But in realness, would you really say it makes you do things? Im going to start medication without my parents knowing (I'm an adult but I live now with them) and don't want to do strange stuff",1
"Maybe because how many people have problems with it, or at least that's the vibes I've been getting. Here antidepressants and stuff like that is such a taboo sometimes that It's not even talked about",1
I have to take it in the morning,1
I haven't bought them yet,1
Benzos sometimes create paradoxical effects,1
If you have too much you can black out & then yeah it’s dangerous territory for getting into some serious trouble. If you are taking one or less than one you should be fine and not have a problem with anything like that but if you ever got addicted and started taking more than one in a dose or mixing it with other things then yeah it can put you in some wierd situations,1
"Yeah, here it's in the drinking water",1
"Arnt there sleep meds out there that are not benzo related?

Personally for me first trying xanax i wouldnt be able to sleep i felt like i was walking on a cloud.

Maybe do some research (im not well versed in sleep meds) but something that can become so physical depending even if you use as perscribed",1

Hello everyone, I’m 37M.

My Story: Falling asleep has been difficult for me all my life. I started smoking cannabis about 28 years ago to help, and now I feel like I need it. I've tried different solutions, and most doctors have diagnosed me with insomnia or anxiety, giving me various pills over the years. Benzos worked well, but as soon as I stopped, my symptoms worsened. Meditation, breathing exercises—nothing seems to work consistently. My insomnia isn’t every night; it’s a bit seasonal.

Current Approach: I decided to try taking Xanax once a week. I sleep great that night, and usually, I get a few nights of better sleep afterward (though this depends on different factors). I feel like this approach is manageable as long as I’m not getting dependent on Xanax (I was once prescribed to take it daily).

Sleep Pattern:

Friday: 10-12 hours (good quality sleep)

Saturday: 8-10 hours easily

Sunday: 6-7 hours if it’s a rough week

Monday: Max 5 hours

Then 3-4 hours until Friday rolls around again


I’ve had many nights with zero sleep. This seems to run in my family, as my sister has similar issues. I generally feel okay after 5 hours of sleep, but it's very hard to sleep anywhere other than at home, even if I travel for a few days.

What Helps: I swim three times a week, which seems to help a bit.

Question: Has anyone here found an effective way to “switch off” and get to sleep consistently? And any advice on avoiding dependency on Xanax with this weekly approach?


Here’s a cleaned-up version of your Reddit post for clarity:

I have tried to research this before but for a peace of mind i figured why not ask. I am 24 (F) 107 pounds and I took xanax (.25) at midnight last night. it’s now almost 5:30 pm the next day and I wanna have some drinks. i feel like i’ve done this before with not thinking anything of it but i usually wait 24 hours. i just wanna be cautious. is it okay to drink? ,1

"Hey, I'm 24M, I've had a general anxiety disorder and panic attacks on and off since 2019, I usually have good phases where I'm on Zoloft then once I feel fully \*recovered\* I get off it and realize my anxiety was just hiding underneath. I got off it again since last fall because I'm motivated to truly work on exposure and get rid of it for good as even with Zoloft I don't truly feel myself and I still have some limitations or places I'm too afraid to go with it. I always have a xanax prescription but I haven't used it in maybe 6 months as the tiredness deter me from using it.

  
So yeah, it's been a few months without any med where it has been mixed, some good days, some bad days. I always have a xanax prescription but I haven't used it in maybe 6 months as the tiredness deter me from using it regularly to deal with panic attacks and once I haven't used it for a while I get scared to use it again even during a panic attack because I somehow fear it will make it even worse. But this weekend I had to study for my final uni exams coming monday and the anxiety was unbearable. Today was especially awful as I have for most of the day this lingering anxiety in the background that froze me and made me unable to focus and study.

  
So this afternoon I decided to take another half xanax (0.25mg) for the first time in 6 months or so. After 20 minutes of stress just after taking it I found this amazing bliss. It's as if there was this warm presence that held me in their arms and told me to stop worrying, that I wasn't going to die and it felt amazing. It's been a few hours. How can a medication works so well and why can't I feel like this all the time. I don't know if it's because I haven't taken it in so long but damn this feels amazing, I suddenly want to do all the outdoor activities I've been avoided for the past weeks/months. Even my outlook on things are positive, this morning I was dreading my monday exams and scared of having a panic attack during them or in the commute but now I'm very optimistic and ready to tackle them.

  
Why can't this feeling last? I don't want to use them often as the tiredness makes me unable to focus too and I don't want to be addicted but still, I do therapy, exposures, try a lot of various thing but nothing really make me feel this ""normal"".",1

Hi, I am changing from Xanax to clonazepam because the tolerance from Xanax had gotten ridiculous and I didn’t want to end up on the road of increasing the dose (which my psychiatrist won’t do anyway) until I am in a full blown horrible situation, I feel like I’m going insane. I started on 1mg Xanax a day in Feb 2023 and 0.5mg would knock me out. It worked so well until about August / September. By that point I was on 3mg a day, 4mg on really bad days. Fast forward to now, I was still on 3mg a day, occasionally 4mg. But I was at the point I was stretching the dose as long as possible because I knew I would be lucky to get an hour out of it. I just suffered. It was lucky if 2mg deescalated me from a flashback or panic attack. So I made the decision to ask my psychiatrist to change me to clonazepam, I was crying and told him I was terrified but want my mental state to improve, so he was a bit hesitant as he thought it wouldn’t go well as I have such severe anxiety and I am trying to return to work. But he understood my concerns and put me on 2mg clonazepam a day. He gave me the option to switch straight over or cross taper. I felt confident to switch straight over as I’ve tried most other benzos except lorazepam and some other less known ones. I used to be on 0.5mg clonazepam with a previous crappy psychiatrist. 

Anyway I started the clonazepam Monday and the first two days were great but Wednesday things started to go downhill. During the day I was ok but at night I fell apart and relapsed. I ended up deciding to cross taper but I was already taking the 2mg clonazepam by this point. So I took 2mg Xanax and it was like neither of them did ANYTHING AT ALL. it has been like this every day since and only getting worse. I also know that technically 1mg Xanax = 1mg clonazepam and I’m now on a lower dosage. However there’s conflicting information about this (I.e. that clonazepam dosage is lower) but for someone with high tolerance it would likely be on the higher side.

I tried to contact my psychiatrists office but he’s in high demand so replied to my email saying to go to my GP to sort it out, which is fine as in Aus Xanax is a Schedule 8 (tricky for GPS) clonazepam is a schedule 4 which isn’t as much of an issue. I’m wondering what to do now because I feel like clonazepam is doing nothing but I spoke to the crisis team and they said that usually people are tapered off Xanax WAY SLOWER. Like down by 0.5mg a month. My psychiatrist didn’t necessarily say I couldn’t taper but he knows I am very self efficacious with medications. 

Has anyone else had a similar issue? What did you do? Did you try valium, temazepam or lorazepam instead? I really want some hope things are gonna get better. Part of me is just like go back on the Xanax and suck it up, the devil you know I guess.

FYI I have CPTSD, BPD, GAD, MDD, Autism & ADHD and chronic health issues (FND, Hypothyroidism - I was born without a thyroid.)
Also on lamotrigine 250mg, pristiq 100mg, thyroxine 150mg, compounded t3 6mcg, propranalol 10mg tds, vyvanse 40mg & Dex 5mg bd. I take Thorne multivitamins - b12, iron byglycinate, magnesium, chromium and trace minerals, zinc Picolinate, vitamin c, fish oils and compounded d3,
I vape and drink responsibly. Nil other substances.

I also present with a slight pericardial effusion. I’ve been a daily weed smoker since highschool, will enjoy a drink on very rare occasions, other than that I’m a square and very anti drugs. Including prescription medication.  my cardiologist can’t figure out what’s going on, however the state of my heart isn’t what I’m concerned about as i ask this question. 

So basically, I have horrible, and I mean horrible anxiety. I’ve always struggled, don’t get my wrong, but as I enter my mid twenties, this anxiety is different. What bothers me about it is this tension that I carry, that shows up in my body language, and I feel it’s starting to affect me socially because my tense body language makes other people uncomfortable. I am on a constant edge, my tolerance for people is extremely low and I’m just sick and tierd and not being able to enjoy myself when I hang out with my friends. In the past, I’ve been in therapy and have been offered to be prescribed things like gabapentin, xanax, klonopin to help with my undercurrent of angst, however I wouldn’t even consider it. But now, as I’m a little older, and feeling somewhat desperate, I feel like I should maybe be open to considering other options to manage this because it’s taking a toll on my self esteem and people don’t want to be around me anymore. With the state of my heart, if I was going to start using a percsiption medication , will they be unsafe for my heart considering I already have a very low heart rate upon rest?  Im afraid they would lower my HR too much that they would make my heart stop. I worry enough about dying in my sleep every night that I have been setting alarms at 2 hour incrimate for the last year and a half  so I wake up every 2 hours to make sure I don’t fall into a deep enough sleep to where my heart rate gets that low. Im scared of these drugs, truthfully. And I grew up in a generation where people my age have succumbed to the abuse of prescription medication , and that just really scares me. I really value the opinion of a doctor who can give me some insight into this matter and I truely appreciate any feedback given to me. 

Thank you.",1

I have been taking .25 mg xanax for a year. 3 months ago I lowered dose to half a tab. I’m noticing if I go lower I get tremors and severe anxiety. Am I at risk of seizure on such a low dose if I just quit and deal with the withdrawals? Or is there a safer taper?",1

It’s a week later and the pneumonia is mostly clear.  She’s on a nose feeding tube in hopes that she gains weight.   She’s still sluggish. If I get a few words I’m happy.  Sleeps all day.   Could that still be due to the Xanax?",1

Sometimes I get these during stressful times or my anxiety is high. I take 0.5 xanax when this shit happens. Do it maybe 2-3 times a year.

For the past 3 weeks I’ve been taking 2x0.5mg (0.5mg twice throughout the day, not at once) of Xanax every 2-3 days.  It’s helped with my sleep and anxiety but I’ve also developed internal tremors that seem to happen whenever I stop taking it.

I also feel really anxious when I’m off it but I’m not sure if that has anything to do with the drug itself or the massive amount of anxiety I’ve been having regardless.

Next week, I’m having a CT with contrast to confirm something seen on an MRI I had recently.

Either way, there’s something going into my bloodstream, so I’m going to be tense as hell for the entire day.

Can I take Xanax without any contraindications? I have some .5mg for if I have to fly, but I was thinking about just taking half. Would I need to tell them at the place I’m getting the CT done? Or is it common for people to need a sedative for an iodine contrast?

"Ok so some background info, I have thickened endometrial lining with vascularity which showed up on a transvaginal ultrasound 2 weeks ago. I have been out of my mind with worry since that it's something cancer related as my GP said he couldn't say it wasn't cancer and my radiographer really scared me during the ultrasound as her composite demonstrably changed during the procedure and she started questioning me if I was married and had kids (no to both)

Here's my previous post;

(Sorry on mobile and I don't know how to link to my previous post, can't find a URL for it so I'm just going to copy and paste it here below)

""Hello everyone.


Sorry for this, but I am freaking out right now.


For some background info, I'm a 36F, never had kids and very rarely used hormonal oral contraceptives. For most of my life I was morbidly obese but I have recently lost over 140lbs.


I have been having mid cycle bleeding, monthly, for the past few years but my smear tests came back normal. The last one came back normal but I was HPV positive.


I had a pelvic ultrasound and a transvaginal ultrasound done last week. I knew by the radiographers reactions and questions that something wasn't right and my doctor has gotten the report back from the hospital today.


From what he said, I had abnormal thickening of the endometrium with vascularity. I didn't think to ask how thick. My left and right ovaries look normal and whatever showed up, I've been told is ""localised"" 


I asked straight out if it could be cancer but he couldn't give me a definite answer either way so I have to have more tests done.


I feel like I'm at high risk for endometrial/uterine cancer having been morbidly obese most of my life (I'm at a healthy BMI now, and I started menstruation early, rarely took birth control and never had kids).


I am so scared and anxious and panicking right now.


Aside from the unexplained bleeding, I've been feeling OK, no signs of being sick.


This has come as such a shock for me, just when I thought I was at my healthiest after losing so much weight.


What are the chances that this could be cancer?


Has anyone hear ever gone through something similar or have experience of thickening of the endometrium?


I'm just so scared and fearful for what this could mean and what the future holds.""

Anyways, I have a gynaecologist appointment tomorrow as my ultrasound results warranted further investigation.

I have never seen a gynaecologist before, I've only ever had 2 previous pap smear tests in the past with my GP.

So I'm really nervous about this visit and unsure as to what to expect, will they do a colposcopy or biopsy?

Would I be OK to take some Paracetamol and Ibuprofen before my appointment as I'm already frightened of the examination and any pain which I might encounter (I've been reading some horror stories which hasn't helped) also I was prescribed some Xanax as I've been so anxious and getting panic attacks over all of this, but I haven't taken any yet, I'm half thinking of taking 0.25mg tomorrow before my appointment so I'm a little more loose and not as on edge for my appointment, would this be OK or a big no-no?

Sorry for the silly questions, this is all brand new to me and I'm so nervous and scared.

" 

52 Female, 5ft, 175lbs DMV area - currently diagnosed with Major Depression, PTSD, Agoraphobia with panic disorder. Psych drugs now- Prozac 40mg, Buspar, Doxepin, Xanax. Additionally I take a blood thinner Xarelto and muscle relaxant Baclofen and Metoporol for Tachycardia. Also have Prurgio Nodalaris

In my late 20's I met a psychiatrist through business (a friendship of sorts) while experiencing horrible anxiety, depression and PTSD.

Over the course of 5 years I ended up on a cocktail of drugs that made my life bearable, allowed me to hold down a steady job for the first time.

However when I had any ER visits, the doctors would tell me this cocktail was dangerous and some pharmacists even refused to fill the scripts. Everytime I would tell this psychiatrist this he would counter with, ""he knew me better"", ""the quality of life was more important than the quantity, a lot of BS I realize now, but at the time I thought he knew better than me. There's more to the story of the relationship but to keep it short, he had me on

20 RitialanSR, phentermine, Synthroid (without any thyroid testing), Prozac, and maybe 2 more. I functioned really well, was not depressed but when he moved, no doctor would continue this regimen- and for 2 years I traveled 2 states to see him monthly because despite going to a detox on my own I wasn't functioning. (I developed Seizure disorder, severe agoraphobia and panic attacks returned,2 psychotic breaks,etc).

I""ve tried tapers outpatient with and without physicians nothing worked and I'm practically a shut in now due to anxiety and God know what else.

For the past 3 years I found a psych who will prescribe 2mgs a day but all it does is hold back from severe withdrawals, no anxiety relief at all, insomnia frequently, have a hard time articulating myself even in my home and I'm triggered in public so often, no one even wants to associate with me because I'm prone to public crying outbursts etc. I've tried to use cannabis recently, but while it stops the anxiety it stops all motivation (and yes I've tried multiple strains, methods (microdosing etc), I'm just not mentally or physically functional. Additionally he prescribes Buspar, Doxepin, Prozac (just 40 mgs, not the 100 I used to take). and they don't seem to do anything at all.

The original psych I saw for 20 years has now moved too far to go see and my former therapist told me that doctor ""abused"" me by prescribing such high amounts of Xanax and some of the meds weren't even appropriate for a psych to be prescribing.

Now at 50 I'm just living pill to pill with no quality of life even though I've been doing the 2mgs of Xanax, prozac and buspar, & doxepin for 2 years hoping it would eventually even out but no.

Is this it? I'm just going to spend my days aching mentally and physically between doses for the rest of my life? Or use cannabis (which I can't even afford on a regular basis as my only relief? Any info would be deeply appreciated.",1
"I am a 5ft, 200lb female, aged 31 with chronic back pain since I was 12. Here is a list of my medical issues starting from aged 12 until now:

12 I was the ideal weight for my height and age.

I was sitting in a chair and bent over to tie my shoe. My lower back tightened like someone pulled two sides of a rubber band and didn't let go. I was stuck bent over for about 10 minutes. I had that weird twinge come sporadically when bending over, turning a certain way, laying down on my back and sometimes when stretching and walking.

My mom took me for an x ray, and they said I had a small curve in my spine and to do physical therapy.

I did physical therapy for a year and the fireworks, twinges, and stiffness never went away.

When I was 14, I had muscle pain in my upper back and muscle pain my lower back. I They did another x ray, and I don't remember the results. I was told to see pain management since physical therapy wasn't working. They did steroid injections in my lower, middle, and upper back. Those worked for 2 months for the pain, but the stiffness and twinges in my back that halted my movement still persisted, they weren't painful.

When the steroid injections and physical therapy didn't work, they tried a different injection while doing an ultrasound. My muscles looked like a heart monitor with a high pulse rate after the injections, the ultrasound showed them flat lightening, so clearly, they were inflamed.

I remained in physical therapy and with injections until I was 16. Then my dad took me off his insurance and I didn't see another doctor until I was 20. I gained weight from 18-20. I was 175 pounds and the doctor did an x ray. said I had mild disc degeneration, needed physical therapy and injections, and that i needed to lose weight. I became pregnant a few months later, lost 50 pounds due hyperemesis, and proceeded to do physical therapy and injections again. birth was perfect.

At this point I was severely depressed. Aged 22. I was 145 lbs, 5ft, and on Zoloft, seroquil, doxamine (sp, it was for bipolar), ambien, and xanax. I dont remember the doses. This is also where my insomnia kicked in.

I had an MRI done in 2017, at 135 lbs; which showed a worse disc degeneration and bursitis in the hips. still not operable, continued doing injections and PT. I got diagnosed with sleep apnea. Stopped taking all of the medicines listed above due to depression getting worse and losing the energy to do anything from the pain.

Got another MRI done in October 2023 of hip and spine after delivering my second child (no complications besides having trouble pushing from 1 to 0. couldnt get her past my pelvis until i got on all fours) and it came up with a worse herniated disc, bursitis, tendinitis, and arthritis in my lower back, buttock and hips. Both sides with the right being worse. Still not operable because, ""it's not touching nerves"".

Fast forward to current day:

Sleep got worse, even with the CPAP machine. I've taken every medication under the sun for sleep, and NOTHING KEEPS me asleep. I have hallucinations when going to bed and barely falling asleep, wake up seeing things like faces or lights, my dreams are extremely vivid and make me think I'm awake. I wake up between 7-14 times a night WHILE using a newly updated pressure settings for my CPAP and lunesta 3mg for random feelings and PAIN in my LEFT and RIGHT sides of my hip/back. I have gone to my locker, emptied someone else's contents only to realize the number I thought said my locker, was someone else's. I panicked and reloaded it. I saw numbers on my register that were never there. I see shadows and objects at the corner of my eyes at times.

I can no longer bear down to poop

I lose control of my bladder when its full

I lose my balance when walking and turning and my hip snaps/cracks at least 100 times a day

I teeter when climbing stairs

I have fell off a ladder from my lower right back getting a shock of pain, then my leg gave out and I fell backwards.

I lifted my toddler out of her crib and spun to my back to prevent falling and dropping her

Move my feet in the physical therapy exercises makes my back feel like it's on fire and burns.

i feel pain all around my waist

i have tingling in my hands, feet, and especially fingers

my neck has been stiff and hurting between my shoulder and where it meets my neck at the base

Walking makes my back feel like someone is stabbing me from the inside out and then it burns in response

bending over and sitting is agony, its like im putting pressure on my lower back/hip

I have had an updated MRI as the pain has become significantly worse, and now not a single style of injection is working. No steroids, muscle relaxers, anti-inflammatory, injections, whatever that thing is called where it goes in the joints with medicine, etc have worked. All they do is numb the pain, but then I still have weakness, and a weird tingling in the areas that hurt.

What did this updated MRI tell you, because I've seen so many doctors and all of them outside of actual spinal surgeons tell me the last thing to do is operate on the disc and I keep getting refused.

I am miserable.

"25F, 5'5, 123 lbs, white

So I've been on prescribed xanax for quite some time to help with sleep. I don't remember how much I took last night...anywhere from 1.0-2.0 mg because I was very anxious. I usually take anywhere from 0.5-1.5 mg. I also take steroid nasal sprays and I'm on an antibiotic (doxycycline) for a sinus infection.  I don't know if this is also related but I have Raynaud's syndrome and had a slight Raynaud's attack yesterday in one of my fingers for a few minute.  I woke up this morning and had very little appetite. I tried drinking coffee and it tasted like water even when adding sugar, and I tried eating but my sense of taste has greatly diminished and my whole mouth feels kind of numb. Is this normal?",1
"I’m male, 15, 5’8, and 117lbs, and I have horrible depression and anxiety, possibly ADHD but I was wondering how to get prescriptions, I’ve taken Xanax and it helped with my depression and anxiety but it wasn’t prescribed, a friend gave it to me and it worked and aside from the Adderall I have focusing issues and I was hoping this could help that a bit",1
"I’m new to this sub, and making posts on reddit in general, so forgive me if this isn’t the correct place to post this.

Anyways, I need to go to a doctor monthly to get my prescription refilled because it’s a controlled substance. So I was going to a doctor that actually listened to me and gave me the help that I needed in order to sleep. I have tried EVERYTHING that was reasonable with that doctor and eventually he ended up putting me on 1mg Xanax every night to fall asleep. Perfect, it worked great, with zero negative side effects, and after awhile I moved down to .5mg Xanax because it worked as well, so why be taking an extra .5 that I didn’t need to be taking. After many months of being on Xanax and under that doctors care, he ended up getting a better job offering in another state, so I was transferred to another doctor that worked alongside him in the same building and everything. So now I’ve been seeing him for many many months, and everything was fine! Recently I missed an appointment and wasn’t able to make it in for a week or two(was in another state) so I went without my sleep meds for that time. Now because I missed an appointment, and couldn’t make it in right away, he’s taken it upon himself to insist that I am put on an antidepressant simply because “it might have sedative effects”. I’m beyond upset about this because I out right voiced to him that I didn’t want to be put on an antidepressant, that my medication was working fine and that I’ve already tried all of the other reasonable medications where the negative side effects don’t out weigh the benefits for just having a hard time falling asleep. I’m not depressed, I don’t want to have to take an antidepressant that only could possibly have the side effect of drowsiness along with all these other negative side effects, and in the mean time of jumping through these hoops, I’m missing out on more sleep and it’s causing more stress in every aspect of my life, when nothing needed to change and I had a medication that worked just fine and I was happy with. I tried voicing my concerns and what I wanted, but my words were disregarded. What do I do? Is there anything that I can do? Would my primary care take up upon themselves to write me a prescription? Either just for while I wait till my next appointment, or indefinitely? Because to be honest, that totally ruined that place for me. Any help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!!! Thanks!",1
"Background:

I'm a 23 year old male, in good health and weight. Never had any major illnesses or taken medication before recent months. I'm from outside the US.

Basically I suffered from pretty severe anxiety from roughly the age of 12 to 22. Education on mental illness here is not very good, so I never understood the panicky feelings I would experience every day, but I was an expert at bottling it all up and appearing normal and cool on the outside.

As the years went on it became worse and worse, and more difficult to contain and I broke down crying while explaining to my doctor about how I felt. He told me straight out that I was suffering from anxiety and started me on anti depressants. Over the next few months it pretty much opened my eyes and I see now the faults in my thought processes. Did therapy, thought diary's, meditation,  exercise, colouring, you name it and then I came off the antidepressants. That was about 5 months ago.

Here's where the problem is. I'm pretty confident now that I have a good hold of what's going on in my head, but the physical symptoms that I developed throughout those intensely anxious years have yet to go away.

I get a really intense burning sensation on my face, and it seems that my body has become 'allergic' to things like food, dust, pollen etc. It's as if my body is still stuck in fight mode and doesn't realise the fire has stopped. 

For example, if I go and eat a regular meal, I get that really intense burning sensation and my skin gets very red and oily over the following few days. Before, I could only eat a handful of foods without experiencing this feeling, which led me to having an extremely limited diet until I discovered xanax.

Xanax seems to 'tranquilize' my body's crazy response to harmless things and allows me eat normally. I don't use it for the high or calming effect that it's popular for. The dose I'm taking is about 0.4mg per day, in 2 doses. After the first dose I can eat regularly, the second dose is 6 hours later and it's just to stop my body from 'waking up'. I get zero mental effects from this drug, it's entirely physical.

So for the meantime I have a temporary solution to stop my body from spazzing out every time I eat a banana, but this can't be good for the long term, especially since this xanax is not prescribed to me and I can't discuss it with my doctor or he would flip.

Does anyone have any advice for me? Or why my body acts in this way? I think this situation is pretty unique and it's scary to think that these symptoms may never go away. The thought of using xanax for years is not very appealing and there's potential side effects too.

* *March through August:* Dieted from 175lbs to 145lbs. I did keto to start, then moved to intermittent fasting. 
* *September:* Diagnosed with GHSV1. This stressed me out a bit. A really mild outbreak, no pain. It was moderately itchy, I didn't experience any of the standard blister looking herps.
* *October:* Home alone so I decided to binge eat a pizza and watch some tv. I ate a whole pizza while watching a sitcom. Suddenly my heart rate was 140 BPM (standard resting is 60-70 BPM). Went to my school's infirmary and they gave me 20mg propranolol. A few days later I did something similar. I ate half a bag of the family sized ruffles and some French onion dip. Heart rate quickly escalated to 135 BPM. Saw Doctor #1. He attributed it to panic attacks. I didn't feel like they were panic attacks since my only symptom was a stupidly high heart rate. Told me to keep doing propranolol as needed and gave me a holter monitor to rule out other things. Before I got my holter monitor I binge ate the last half of the potato chip bag and the other half of the dip. Heart rate was now 145 BPM. Started to realize it was a trend and I stopped eating anything but yogurt/granola/fruit and eggs/cheese. I haven’t had another panic attack since.
* *November:* Saw a psychiatrist and he prescribed me Buspar. I was eating normally again, but no more binge eating.
* *Thanksgiving week:* Went on vacation to my sister’s home on the west coast. I weighed 142 pounds when I left. I didn’t binge eat any meals, but I did eat more than normal and ate a lot of cheese. Come Wednesday my stomach was starting to act up. I attributed this to being a week and a half into Buspar and it was a side effect, at least it cleared up nearly all of my anxiety? Thursdays/Thanksgiving I couldn’t even eat out of pain. I was in a lot of pain and ended my vacation early. Stopped the Buspar (I took half pills when I got some headaches to wean myself off) I headed to the urgent care clinic, she said it was gastritis and gave me the Prilosec and Carafate. I started feeling less burning and stabbing and told me to do a follow up with my PCP. At this point I weighed 135lbs. I was surprised that I didn’t gain weight and ended up losing weight on that trip.
* *Doctor #2:* PCP-kind of. My school’s rotating resident in their PCP facility. She thought I had gastritis and told me to keep taking my medication. She wanted to get me in for an ultrasound to rule out gallstones. Her attending, Doctor #3, (same attending from Doctor #1) came in and said her opinion was wrong. He said it was just stress, to stop the Prilosec and Carafate and start taking a Benzo (I forgot which Benzo they offered me). I denied their treatment option.
* *Doctor #4:* Not related to my school’s doctors anymore. My old PCP that sees my parents too. She sent me in for a CT Scan. It came up normal so she ordered the HIDA scan. My EF was 32% so she said to remove my gallbladder. Her nurse said it was fine to stop taking the Prilosec and Carafate because they aren’t my root causes for my pain (it’s just my gallbladder)

My problems with this is that I can’t stop the Carafate. My body wakes me up in the middle of the night when it wears off because the amount of pain I am in. I tried being off of it for most of today and the pain came back despite not eating anything. I get pain even when I don’t eat and it is my first time ever experiencing anything like this. I feel like the stabbing pain in my right side may be my gallbladder, but I definitely have other issues going on that feel more urgent.

Can gallbladder issues cause ulcers? Can I request an upper endoscopy before I go through a cholecystectomy? Which doctor is right? I don't know what to do :/",1

&#x200B;

Hi there good peoples of Reddit! I am hoping to get a second opinion on the benzo taper plan my doctor has prescribed me.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: My doctor has prescribed me 8mg of Valium/diazepam (split into two doses of 4mg, per day) for tapering off of \~4mg/day of Xanax. I noticed that they looked on the internet for a tapering/dose guide when making the prescription. Did they perhaps make a mistake in converting the two, or is there something I'm missing? I'm afraid of serious withdrawal effects.** 

&#x200B;

Long story short: having tried prescribed alternatives (SSRIs, wellbutrin, Lyrica) and not having excellent results (or awful side effects), about 1.5yrs ago I began to self-medicate with Xanax for my anxiety and depression (seriously, I was not using it for recreational reasons!). Knowing from having them prescribed sometimes in the past, to approach benzos with caution, I was careful and things went ok in the beginning. Unfortunately, taking it occasionally in mild amounts for sleep or panic attacks snowballed over time into needing more and more to sleep, and eventually withdrawals were setting in each morning after, and it became a morning and day thing, too. I have learned things the hard way, and over the past year, was at my peak ingesting perhaps 5-6mg/day just to be able to feel normal (ugh...)

&#x200B;

Over that time, I have grown to absolutely hate the way that I am physically addicted to this crap, and just want to taper off and go through whatever length of hell I have to, to detox fully and get it out of my life. For what it's worth, I do not feel any psychological dependence or cravings, nor do I feel psychologically relieved when I take my dosage to stave off withdrawal. I just feel miserable on it, period. 

&#x200B;

I began an active personal plan to get off the stuff some months ago. I am aware of possible serious effects of going cold turkey, and quite frankly I am scared to death and would never do that, but I am willing to endure any tapering plan as long as it's safe in terms of risk of seizure/psychosis/all that bad stuff.   


Over the past 3-4 months I have been able to carefully reduce my dosage down from the 5-6mg/day to 3.5-4mg/day. I did this by each morning taking out my dosage and breaking the Xanax bar into as small as possible of pieces. Every \~2 weeks or so I would drop it by what was the smallest bit I could break the bar of Xanax into.  


It's gotten to the point where each time I try to go lower, it's so bloody hard to break the Xanax into enough pieces that I can split it out over the day, and I am constantly in the depths of withdrawal hell. 

&#x200B;

So, I had to swallow whatever dumb thing was keeping me from letting my doctor know that I had stupidly gone and self-medicated, and ask for help.

&#x200B;

FWIW, my doc is very compassionate and nice, and didn't react negatively at all, and wants to help. I should have told her a lot earlier, but fear of stigma and losing my doc's trust stopped me. Lesson learned (again!).

&#x200B;

My doctor has agreed to do out-patient doctor assisted benzo tapering with me - because of my small business I cannot go to inpatient rehab, as I would probably be financially destroyed. I was given a prescription for a longer acting benzo (diazepam) at 4mg, twice daily (8mg total per day). I was instructed to cease use of the Xanax immediately and only take the diazepam, and will be following up regularly during the taper. When the prescription was being written, I noticed that my doc looked up Xanax/diazepam charts on what seemed to be the internet before writing it. Is it possible that 8mg/day is far too little? I'm afraid of the sudden jump from the amount of Xanax I was taking to the other benzo. From what I know (and I am no doctor of course! Hence, you guys here!), 1mg of xanax is closer to 5-15mg of diazepam, depending on who you talk to.  


Does someone have a second opinion before I call and clarify with my doctor? I don't want to second guess her, as I know benzos are a sensitive issue and I really don't want to come off like I'm trying to ""get more"" or whatever. That's not the case. I REALLY just want to safely get off this crap forever!

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance for any advice!!!",1
"I'm not allowed to give top-level comments here. Here's my message:

  
Ok, I'll give it a shot:

* Benzos work by binding to GABA-A receptors in your brain (basically, they calm neuronal activity)
* Long term use means that the brain adapts to the constant presence of the Benzo and the GABA-A receptors become less reponsive (downregulation). This means you need ""more"" to achieve the same effect.
* Long term use also means reduction in your natural inhibitory mechanisms. Your GABA-A receptors can decrease in number and become less sensitive. This means you have now become ""dependent"" on the Benzo for ""normal"" function. If you quickly stop the medication, you are no longer able to naturally keep neuronal activity in check (bad news)
* Other side bits: long term use can lead to ""paradoxical effects"". You can start to feel more anxious and your anxiety can worsen. Also, long term use can lead to a dulling of your cognitive processes -- read: cognitive impairment affecting memory, attention, decision making, etc.

Summary: Benzos are not good for long-term use because they fundamentally alter the function of the GABA-A receptors in your brain. Your brain's natural balance is disrupted and normal function becomes difficult without the drug.",1
"I started taking Xanax for anxiety from my C-PTSD, and kept taking it (and still do) as you described here - sparingly, as needed - for the meltdowns from being on the autism spectrum and having ADHD. I love my psychiatrist",1
I would not condone it but realistically it’s going to happen,1
"I can confirm. I had a very serious grand mal seizure from stopping Xanax. My dr refused to step me down, so I just stopped. That seizure easily could have killed me, I was told.",1
"Of course its possible! Strange that your prescriber didn’t recommend this, but generally the way that its done is slowly tapering down the dosage of the current medication over the course of several months and then moving to a less potent drug such as Klonopin to finish tapering down over another few months. If your doctor is forcing Xanax upon you, I’d consider getting a second opinion. 

Sudden withdrawal IS dangerous but if done correctly, it can be managed. You have to be patient with the process, and if you follow the procedure recommended by your doctor, you will be able to overcome this. 

I just want to emphasize: do not try doing this without supervision from a doctor, and reddit does not count",1
I took Xanax for ten years. It’s very difficult to withdraw but I feel it was worth it. My psychiatrist did a whole outline for me and I wish I still had it. But you didn’t just taper. You tapered for like two days but then took a full dose. Then tapered for a few days and took a little stronger dose but not full dose. It worked really well. My psychiatrist was awesome. So don’t just taper down it’s too difficult,1
"As others have suggested, look at the Ashton Manual as well as benzobuddies.org. The latter is awesome!!! I tapered off 1.5mg of Clonazepam after 13 years on benzos.  It's was bad but only terrible sometimes. It took 18 months.  It was SOOOOO worth it.  I'm a changed person.

Others have suggested switching to Clonazepam to taper but that might be wrong.  All of the stronger benzos (Ativan, Xanax, Klonopin) given in small doses are supposed to be the worst.  Weaker benzos like Valium are supposed to be easier.  I think the suggestion is generally to switch over to Valium and then taper.

In general, look up micro tapering.  Benzobuddies should be your home for the next few years if you do this. I wrote up a protocol on a spreadsheet and tapered by micrograms at first and literal fractions of a microgram near the end.  It's the way to go.

Don't worry if your psych nurse doesn't have much experience in this area.  There aren't a whole lot of benzo users who taper. Just make sure they will support you. My psych nurse hadn't worked with anyone who had tapered like me.  She knew people did micro tapers but that's it.  She was 100 percent supportive though.  I showed her my plan and she backed me for a year and a half.

It's not a race.  A basket of hugs for you.",1
"My prescriber is in no way ""pushing it"" on me but expresses hesitance for a few reasons including I live in an incredibly triggering environment that is out of my control. The Lexapro was intended to deal with the anxiety and seems to have been the most helpful at dealing with my obsessive symptoms rather than anxiety. We have talked about moving the dose to a .5 XR BID as an initial step down and using the regular to treat breakthrough anxiety. It just all feels so much. I know the feelings of withdrawal and they are terrifying.  Maybe it is me being too weak to go through it",1
oh man ! glad you made it through. I don’t think that’s much of an advert for cold turkey,1
"I’ve read a post by somebody where their wife was using Flubromazolam(a RC benzodiazepine that’s *way* more powerful than Alprazolam..) and she was completely delirious from withdrawals, not even able to be comprehended. So yeah, it is scary scary shit.",1
"yeah man it was like 100x 2mg xannax 50x 5mg Valium and 25x 10mg temaz a week. I don’t remember a lot, still have a shocking memory I think I really shot it, lucky I didn’t overdose as I was heavily drinking on the weekends. but surprisingly I have never been more stable at work and was even promoted, post taper I cannot hold an office job, had to quit and am back to bottom tier labour intensive work. bzd here I come",1

Agreed.  What I was trying to say was that physical dependency is part of the issue but the psychological dependency lasts well after the physical dependency is done and is often harder to kick than the physical dependency,1
Clonazepam is quite possibly the most addictive but diazepam has the longest half life. I’ve been through the medical detox. It’s not fun but it’s not terrible,1
I was taking Effexor XR for seven years at various doses for depression. I was at 225mg for a long time and have been slowly coming down 75mg every 2 weeks. I'm now at 75mg and the withdrawal (aka discontinuation syndrome) has started. I'm exhausted and nauseous. Benedryl and Dramamine nondrowsy are helping some but it's still rough.

"this is about my best friend/room mate, so specifics and personal details may be a bit lacking but I'm determined to help however I can lol.

he was on 150 mg effexor xr for ~2 years (75 mg for 6 months then 150 mg for 1.5 years I think). buspar in addition to the effexor for ~6 months initially, then stopped taking that for ~6 months and then reestablished a 1 mg 3x a day xanax prescription he'd had for years prior.

he's been prescribed a myriad of antidepressants and a few antipsychotics in childhood and none really had a significant effect.

after that long on that high a dose of effexor and finally seeking help due to its ineffectiveness (and perhaps it's tendency to worsen his anxiety), his doctor weaned him off the effexor by having him take 75 mg effexor xr + 10 mg prozac + 1 mg xanax 3x a day for 7 days. after 7 days she told him to take 20 mg prozac + 1 mg xanax 3x a day.

he and I aren't sure if it's the effexor withdrawal due to insufficient weaning time or negative reaction to the prozac, but he's noticed increased paranoia I guess you could call it. hearing car doors and noises that may or may not be real, but.

nevertheless instantly thinking the car door or various noises (dogs, muffled voices, car engines, etc) are right outside and that they're produced by intruders of some kind. he describes feeling overstimulated by movement/sounds etc (said recently while sitting outside on a peaceful but windy day that it made him nervous and all he saw was chaos his brain couldnt make sense of) and unusually suspicious.

he's had two anger outbursts (a recurrent issue for him when feeling threatened) but nothing TOO crazy or out of the ordinary.

he seems to me more dependent upon company for mood stabilization. if he's all alone at home while I'm at work he gets depressed, but within half an hour of me being home he perks up significantly.

just wanting feedback on what these feelings and issues that are new to him may be caused by. his next appointment is in a week and he plans to discuss them then but the quick weaning time makes me a little suspicious of this doctor. though it's not as if I'm qualified or anything, I feel like wellbutrin may be promising for him since I knew someone who felt awful paranoid effects on prozac who switched to wellbutrin and saw significant improvement.

any feedback, personal accounts, stuff to read etc is appreciated guys",1
"hey guys really quick question. I've been on effexor xr for about two months now, 75MG and I've done some research on the effects of combining alcohol and effexor. Now, I wanna know if this is dangerous to your immediate well being/health, or if it just increases side effects. The heaviest I'll drink is maybe 3-4 beers with about a 4.0%-5.0% of alcohol. ps I'm 20 years old. ",1
"Hi all,

I was curious if anyone else has ever experienced paranoia in the form of intrusive thoughts with Venlafaxine? I know a lot of people loathe the medicine and there are a lot of negative side effects, especially when stopping. I started venlafaxine over 2 years ago at 75mg and slowly increased to 150mg for the last year. It seemed to be working okay when combined with Welbutrin.


 Fast forward to about a month ago and I finally decided to bring up some issues I've had with my heart rate that has been going on for over 2 years to my internal medicine doctor. Basically what happens is that I will be sitting or laying down and my heart rate should be at a resting pulse. But, at random times it will jump up to over 115 and as high as 170. Then at other times, it feels like my heart is racing, I get out of breath and feel sick to my stomach but my heart rate is only around 80. I am a healthy male, 5'11"" 170lbs, average shape, I go hiking, like to play sports, and use the elliptical or stationary bike for cardio.  Long story short my doctor gave me a Holter monitor and then was going to give me beta blockers but due to something where the top chambers and lower chambers get out of sync every once in awhile he didn't feel comfortable with that. He decided to up my Venlafaxine to 225mg as he thought it might be anxiety.

This last month has been very weird. I have experienced what I consider paranoid irrational intrusive thoughts, especially at night time. I know these thoughts are not logical but the emotional side of me gets nervous/anxious even though the logical side is telling me to stop. For example, when I turn off the lights at night time and am walking to bed I fear that someone will be next to me trying to stab me as soon as the lights go off, or someone will rush me from down the hall. Another example is when walking outside at night time I am paranoid someone is behind trees waiting to attack me and they are running and hiding behind tree's until they have a perfect opportunity to attack. I know these aren't valid thoughts when I have them but I cannot get them out of my head and I start getting anxious no matter how many times I tell myself these thoughts are not valid. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I am going to my doctor today and planning on telling my doctor. It does not feel like it has helped with the heart issues but instead made me more depressed/anxious and paranoid. I guess I need to be told that I am not absolutely insane or validation that it is the medicine. I am not sure actually what I need, I just felt like I needed to talk to others who might experience similar issues. 


Thanks in advance!

"Incompetent PSYC NP and my Journey

I was on a bunch of medications that had major interactions and I literally needed to go to the mental hospital inpatient because 1. I was suicidal due to all the medications that were fighting each other. And 2. I was so addicted to the high dose, high potency benzos she had me on plus other medication that was extremely hard to kick. So please, take my story and make sure you aren’t getting snowed by a provider you think is trying to help. I will answer any questions and will be happy to help anyone else with their journey! 

Either way, here is my list from when I entered the mental hospital and please feel free to comment and interact. I would love to communicate! Here it goes. 

And one more thing, I am certain about the doses. They may seem ridiculous but I assure you these are all correct meds and dosages. Thank you for the read! 

1. Clonazepam (Klonopin) 2mg three times daily

2. Alprazolam (Xanax) 1mg twice daily as needed.

Just to put this into better perspective as well, I was 18-19 while being treated by this woman with the diagnosis being fresh as well. This was about a year ago. In October of 2023, was when I entered the mental hospital due to this combination. 

Here are the meds that I came out of the mental hospital with (I have an even better group of meds now) and felt 10x more animated and myself. I didn’t feel like a zombie for the first time in 6-8 months. 

1. Venlafaxine ER (Effexor XR) 75 mg once daily in the AM.

7. Alprazolam (Xanax) 1mg twice daily as needed. 

As you can see it’s quite a difference. I would love to see your guy’s stories and questions. I also have a different medication list now, so if anyone is interested in seeing that as well please let me know!  ",1
"I’m having a hard time. My anxiety skyrocketed. I’m going through an IBS flare up. I haven’t had a colonoscopy or gastroscopy yet, but I’ve had blood tests, stool tests, ultrasonography and MRI done. All perfectly normal. So there is still a possibility that it’s something else but it’s not very likely.

Every time I have to poo I get an anxiety attack. I think it’s a mild one because I don’t lose control or pass out, but I get this surge of absolute despair, racing thoughts, I start the breathe shallowly, I start to shake, cold sweats, weird muscle spasms in my body etc. I mean it might be mild but it doesn’t feel mild really.

Since I poo everyday I get these attacks everyday, sometimes multiple times, sometimes not even triggered by having to poo. A slightly weird feeling in my stomach can cause me to spiral into an anxiety attack.

I’ve been prescribed Effexor along with Remeron, I’ve already been on Remeron but as you can guess I don’t think it has any effect on me anymore. It used to work though, it didn’t help me too much but I was feeling better. This was a year ago of course. Since then it lost its effectiveness.

My psych warned me that I shouldn’t look up Effexor online. Unfortunately she was too late; since I research antidepressants a lot I already knew its side effects, how does it feel while starting, how shitty the withdrawals are etc.

I said ok, because I was desperate. But there is a problem. It’s been a while, and I can’t bring myself to take my medication. And I know that I have to take it, because there isn’t much else left to try. This is not just my opinion, my psych said it herself.

So I have to get better. I have to take my medicine to get better, but I’m scared of it. The more scared I get the worse my anxiety gets. The worse my anxiety gets the more I get scared, and it gets even harder to start my medicine. Lately I haven’t been able to think about anything else other than my bowel issues, I can’t even watch a youtube video.

I’m not suicidal; I have suicidal thoughts yes but I haven’t made any plans, and I have things I want to do, you know? I dropped out of college, and I want to go back. I’m not even exaggerating when I say this; I see myself going back to school literally every night in my dreams. I have gender dysphoria, and I want to at least know how it feels like to be comfortable in your own body. And these things keep me going.

But I also know that I have to take my medicine, and I just don’t know how I can do that. I thought of a couple things that I can try.

-First, I can get myself checked in to a psychiatric ward. Make them force me to take my medicine. There are several upsides and downsides with that. If I get an anxiety attack they can intervene. I will be forced to take the medicine, so it has a higher probability of success. But on the other hand, the psychiatric wards in my country have some problems. I’ve read a lot about human rights violations, abuse, mistreatment, violence etc. And I’m sure you can understand, I don’t need this stuff on top of my problems. Also since I’m not a danger to myself or to others they might not even accept me. Also my parents will probably be very angry with me, because I don’t look very nervous or stressed from outside.

-Second, find a way to start taking them on my own. I can ask to start from a lower dose. My psych wanted me to start at 150mg. Effexor XR is available with dosages as low as 37.5mg. I can ask for anti anxiety medication. I have anti nausea medication, and I can take that while starting. This option has upsides and downsides too. First of all if I ask them for anti anxiety medication I’m guaranteed to be seen as a drug seeking patient. They did that before and I don’t even have any drug abuse history. Even if I get them I might not have the willpower to start them. I might end up getting an anxiety attack even if I take anti anxiety medication.

Okay here is the part where I’m talking about stuff I don’t really know much about.

The anti nausea medication I have is Zofran. From what I understand the reason antidepressants cause nausea is because they increase the levels of serotonin in the brain and the digestive system. As a result of that the increased levels of serotonin agonizes the 5HT3 receptors and this causes nausea/vomiting. With repeated use the 5HT3 receptors become down-regulated/desensitized and because of that nausea/vomiting stops.

Now if I were to take Zofran it will prevent me from getting nauseous because it will prevent serotonin from agonizing the 5HT3 receptors, since it’s a 5HT3 antagonist. But that means it will also prevent 5HT3 receptors from downregulated/desensitized, because they aren’t being excessively agonized, and when I stop taking Zofran I will become nauseous or I will vomit, and that defeats the whole purpose of taking Zofran. I don’t want to take Zofran continuously because it comes with its own side effects.

End of the part where I’m talking about stuff that I shouldn’t be talking about.

So now the upsides of the second option.
I won’t have to deal with the psych ward. Considering the healthcare system in my country, I have good reasons to believe that the care they provide at the ward is not good enough. I won’t have to do a lot of explaining to my parents. I won’t have to risk abuse and stuff like that. The “revolving door syndrome” appears to be very prevalent with the mental health facilities in my country.

So what should I do? I know the answer is “if you have a psych why not ask them?” and I know that getting advice from a bunch of strangers on reddit is not a very wise decision, but I really need the opinions of some strangers on reddit on this.",1
"\*\*Disclaimer: I'm using a brand-new Reddit account for this post, I and don't want to share too many details that might identify me. Please bear with me in this regard. I'm desperate for advice - even (especially?) from strangers - since none of the in-person ""wisdom"" I've received (including that from my therapist, who I see 3-4 times a month) is helpful beyond ""you need to do something about this"".\*\*

I'm a 30-something female who has 3 jobs and lives/struggles with manic depression (otherwise known as bipolar disorder). My depressive states involve crying jags, calling in sick to work, fantasizing about how I might die, failing to follow basic hygiene, and other unpleasant behaviors. My manic states range from cocaine-like highs and wonderful creativity/productivity to agitation/aggression to impulsive/dangerous behavior that causes me to lose friends, money, health, and sleep. For both depression and mania, my biggest triggers are departure from routine and sensing major changes in the near future.

I've tried five different psychiatric drugs over the years (Trileptal, Zoloft, Cymbalta, Effexor XR, and Latuda - in that order). The difficult-to-terrifying side effects these medications produced within me - along with the debilitating withdrawal symptoms I experienced from the Effexor XR - are only slightly outweighed by the fact that they either did nothing to help me with my depression and mania or instead ""flattened me out"" so much that I was fake and emotionless. As a result of my experiences, I've been unmedicated for nearly five years now (with the exception of one horrifying day on Latuda in 2018). None of the psychiatrists I've seen have taken psychiatric medication themselves, and my despair over hellish side effects and withdrawal has historically been ignored or disbelieved by them. They all seemed to be throwing darts instead of making conscientious decisions about my medication. 

After a series of panic attacks and breakdowns (including a three-hour one at an international airport in November), I decided in December that I needed to re-consider medication. But now I'm regretting my decision to schedule my psychiatric evaluation (which happens a week from today and will take place with the same shrink who prescribed me Latuda). What's the point in going to this evaluation, I ask myself? I'm a religious person, and I believe that God made me this way. Why fight my identity with chemicals? It's no different to me than injecting chemicals into my eyes to change their color. It's spitting in God's face, really. Why should I hate myself so much that I drug it out of existence? Life with manic depression is painful enough without having to take expensive pills that dull who I am every day.

I just have no clue how to approach this situation. I think of suicide on a regular basis, and my entire life has spun out of control. I seem to have no command over my libido, organization and neatness, health, or moods. And it's well-understood that if I tell the wrong person about how I'm feeling (like I did a few times in the past), I'll get imprisoned against my will in a mental institution..causing me to lose my employment/income/sense of hope, get saddled with a massive hospital bill that will send me further back into the crushing debt I'm currently clawing my way out of, and get worse due to being surrounded by people who are even crazier than I am. 

I know I'm unwell, but I've got all these reservations about trying drugs again. Please advise me with reason and compassion. I'm willing to answer questions that don't reveal my identity. Thanks in advance.",1
"(cross post with r/BipolarReddit)

Starting in 2009 (age 17), I had increasingly awful depression, reaching a peak in late 2014 (age 22), when I checked myself into hospital for 5 days outpatient then 7 days inpatient. After this, my meds were switched from Paxil and Abilify to Effexor XR. In early 2017 (age 24), after gradually increasing the Effexor, I was bumped to 225mg a day. This sent me into a hypo manic episode for a week until I dropped it back to 150mg. My body couldn't keep up with my mind, I had no filter, and I did things without thinking.

This lead to my psych to change my diagnosis from Major Depressive Disorder to Bipolar Disorder Type 2, rapid cycling, as we believed that this wouldn't have happened if I didn't have bipolar, paired with how I had described my depressive episodes as wave-like/ebbing and growing for years. I added on lithium 300mg 2xday at this time.

Now I'm in a new state and have a new psych (age 25). I went to her last week for Rx refills and because I had the worst short-term depression in years. I couldn't work or even get out of bed for 5 days. She says the the Effexor Lithium combo seems to have helped with some issues (anxiety, bulimia, self-harm), but isn't doing enough for the depression. She upped my Lithium to 300mg 3xday and is seeing me March 13th. Her main issue is that I don't have any issues with sleep during my ""up"" periods. I sleep normally. When I'm depressed, I sleep a lot more and have trouble getting up in the morning.

What my issue is: If I don't have bipolar, what are the other possible disorders I could have? What runs similarly to bipolar but isn't? Is there such thing as cyclical depression? If I don't have bipolar, what the hell was that episode in early 2017? (I asked my new psych something like this when I saw her, but she didn't have an answer for me, just shrugged it off...) 

**I'm not asking that you diagnose me, just what is similar to bipolar**

Edit: Added info",1
"I’ve been on Effexor Xr 225mg for the past 4 months and I don’t feel it’s helping much 

I’ve been on concerta xr 27mg and it didn’t help me focus at all just caused lots of sleepless nights even with taking it early in the am so I’m tapering off that now 

I’ve been on zopiclone  for 4 months and I’ve build such a tolerance all it does is realax me and make me feel good(will be tapering off this next week) 


Things feel flat visually and a noticeable moving grainy effect on flat surfaces  that kind of looks like moving grainny shaddows  when I zone out  or are really tired: no field of depth  with either a kind of tunnel vision or or like opposite like full vision  and sometimes solid beams or an array of posts like a fence will look like it’s moving -this gets worse when I get more tired

At night when I’m falling asleep I don’t hear voices but I hear sounds that aren’t there ,weird creppy sounds and my name 
One night I heard little girls singing some creepy song I couldn’t understand 

feel very zoned out and and disconnected from everything emotionally and from everyone and even places I’ve been before seem odd/new  it feels like the world is moving around me
I feel like I don’t recognize myself in the mirror: like I know that it’s me but I don’t recognize that it’s me 

Complete apathy because nothing really matters if I’m  not going to remember it or even feel present and understand it and  it goes by so fast 
Witch leads to sducidal  thoughts because I don’t think I can get better and I think my brain is just fried from all the amounts of weed I used to snake 

It’s not like it would make any difference if I was gone tomorrow- I don’t do anything or usually don’t want to do anything because of this out of it feeling 

Suicide feels very comforting and reassuring because I know it’s always there just waiting for me give in 

Suicidal thoughts are more common but still fleeting - I wish I was dead - I’m better off dead -I really want this all to go away 
-I can’t do anything properly so I might as well -it’s not like I have anything to offer this world I just waste food and oxygen by existing because I’m not living 

Even when I make positive changes they don’t last because I can’t remember them or what to do 

I can’t forum memories or imagine anything in my heads 

Fituge 

Lots of fevers 

Feeling like I’m going to pass out if I stand up fast sometimes and get dizzy and see black 

Feel like I can’t find my words often 
And lose train of thought with all my focus 
Or can’t think at all sometimes, sometimes I feel like I have to force thoughts  and sometimes that doesn’t work I feel like there’s no constant stream of thought mostly just blank -somehow I can write all of this down but I can’t think of it in my head ??
I feel like my iq has dropped 20 points at least at being able to do critical thinking or any thinking in my head
Can’t remember conversations or really follow I can’t focus enough to think in my head or follow and remember what there saying even if is a small 30 second conversation I won’t remember what I just said or what they said 30 seconds ago 
Most things seem in one ear and out the other even if I’m trying to focus and be interested 

I feel very zoned out and and disconnected from everything emotionally and from everyone and even places I’ve been before seem odd/new  it feels like the world is moving around me and that the room I’m in is the only thing that exists 

The words that come out my mouth aren’t thought up first then said they usually just come out and it feels like it’s not me saying them 

I can’t really remember what I do every day unless I journal it down with the help of gf or someone who knows what I did 
And even with that it’s very brief and non descriptive 

Remembering yesterday is really hard- I’ll know that I went to class yesterday but won’t remember much else or what we did in class, three days ago and that’s a complete goner, last week feels like forever ago and I have no idea what I did months or years ago it all feels like a dark void of lost memory 

Small things I can remember like names and little things about people for example I know my gf is 18 and in school in Laurier with brown hair but I feel like I don’t know her because I can’t remember things about her or what we do or talk about 
Like I like being around her and I know I love her but I don’t feel anything warm and fuzzy inside or much connection 





Zoned out and time feels like it goes by so fast like I’m never here and that I don’t exist and like nothing is real and nothing happens- sometimes the place I’m in/what my eyes see feels like it’s the only place that exists 

Why does it matter if I do anything and I’m not going to understand remember feel any way about it and that it will go by so fast like it never happened 

I can’t form these thoughts in my head it’s just that my hands are writing them 


I know this is a mess and probably repetitive but any advice?  I’m just really loosing hope and was wondering if there’s any ideas or thoughts on what I could do different or better
 
Tldr I feel like a zombie emotionally and mentaly blank and can’t focus or remember anything",1
"Not sure if this is the right sub for this, if not please point me in the right direction.  Thank you.

I've been on Effexor XR 37.5mg for over 6 months.  At first it was working well, but now I'm starting to feel like garbage again.  I take it responsibly except for one time a few month ago when I ran out and the pharmacy was slow for like 3-4 days.  So 3-4 days without it left me a mess because of withdrawal.  Anxious, crying spells for no reason, uncontrollably feeling of loneliness.  Once I started taking it regularly again, I felt normal and not depressed.

Now even when taking it regularly, I feel depressed and anxious.  It's like before I went on antidepressants. I'm wondering if I should go the next dose up or my doctor was thinking Wellbutrin.
 
I was an Paxil 10mg up to 30 before and that helped me.  This went on for roughly a year and a half. Then an outside psyche put me on Prozac 20 mg and Trazodone 50mg which FUCKED ME UP!  I was hearing and imagining crazy shit.  And screaming at voices stop. So I had psyche meds fucking me up, and at the same time my dad decided to switch into uncaring dick mode and treating me like shit despite how near my breaking point I was.  It was a fucking mad house...

Anyway...  I kind of want to try my Paxil again since stuff has calmed down immensely and I didn't gain weight.  I'm so sorry that this is a jumbled mess.  If you need any explaining or more info, just ask please.  But what would you people recommend?",1
Sounds worse than OxyContin,1
"I’ve tried dozens of meds over the years trying to find the right cocktail and Effexor was by far, for me, the worst. I’m always surprised when anyone is on it even remotely successfully because it was such a terrible experience for me",1
"I guess it's different for everyone. I get withdrawal effects like dizziness and these side effects, but I've also been on plenty of meds, effexor helps the most of all",1
"Hi everyone, I take 150 mg of Effexor XR (XR-important to note) - I think I forgot to take it this Morning and I’m kind of freaking out. Is this life threatening or am I going to go crazy",1
Has anybody experienced excessive gas while taking Effexor-XR? The past few months I’ve been extremely gassy to the point of pain. I recently got a colonoscopy and endoscopy done and it all came back normal. I was looking online and it shows that gas is a potential side effect of Effexor-XR but I haven’t found much else about it.,1
So about three weeks ago I started taking effexor xr. A few days ago I started taking an increased dose. So I went from 37.5 mg to 75mg. I'm also weaning off of zoloft at the same time. Is it normal to have an increase in side effects? I'm just feeling really gross from the side effects and its freaking me out. I just need some reassurance that it's just the medicine and it will pass. ,1
"I just recently started taking effexor XR and I wanted to know what everyone's experience was with this medication. I'm supposed to go to brunch tomorrow and I want to have a few drinks but I'm worried about it. Has anyone had some drinks on it? I'm on the lowest dose, 37.5 mg. But I'm also on 100mg of zoloft and 7.5 mg of buspirone. I am planning on weaning off the zoloft eventually but havent yet. ",1
"So I'm a third of the way through changing meds. After my dosage of Zoloft was increased, it made me put on weight, so I'm going through the super fun process of transitioning between meds (which usually tries to kill me). My dosage was 150mg and I've been on 100mg for three days, then I have to drop to 50mg for three days, and then nothing for three more days, before I can start on Effexor. I've currently only been a little dizzy, but usually I get super sick coming off and starting meds. Does anyone have any experience with Effexor? Or tips for dealing with the withdrawal symptoms? ",1
"I take Effexor XR 150mg a day.  Though recently I have been getting discontinuation side effects like hand tingling, rushing thoughts and sometimes brain zaps.  I can get these hours after taking the pill or even when I am due to take it.  Any ideas?",1
"I’ve been taken my Effexor XR for 20 years. I am up to 337.5 mg. A few years back my GP added 40mg of celexa because I was starting to have panic attacks again and he thought adding the celexa would be better than increasing my Effexor. I was feeling better but over the past 2 months my anxiety is out of control, I have panic attacks all the time, I get scared to leave the house and will stay home for days. My Doc switched me from celexa to Buspar and I feel so much worse! My anxiety is worse, I feel dizzy, light headed and nauseated all day. I’ve been on the Buspar for 11 days. My doc says to hang in for 2 weeks but I’m not sure I can keep taking it much longer. I’m hoping someone is on this combo and can provide some insight? Or taking Effexor and something else and having some luck? ",1
"Hi there - 
I am new to Reddit and mostly joined because my boyfriend said this subreddit could be helpful for my anxiety issues so here it goes...
I have had anxiety for as long as I remember and thought I was crazy until a doctor in college told me that the thoughts, the on edge feelings, etc are not ""normal"" and I have an anxiety disorder.  It had gotten to the point of not leaving the house, not sleeping, physical pain, trouble eating, and so on.  I was prescribed medication to help get me back to my normal.  Anyhow I have been on three medications since I was diagnosed at 18.
First: Zoloft 100 mg for three years worked fine until senior year of college and then it pooped out.  I still did avoid places that caused me anxiety like theaters and sit-down restaurants, so it did not work as great as I thought it did.
Second: Celexa, I want to say 40 mg?, I was on for only a month or so.  It made my depression so bad.  I was crying at random times, not leaving my room, terrified to do anything in case it would trigger my anxiety.  Then I went to a psychiatrist for the first time in my college town and they prescribed me (Third:) 150 mg Effexor XR at the age of 21.
Within months I started to feel better.  My friends and family saw changes in me.  I participated in life again and became more outgoing.  I no longer avoided places.  I enjoyed things and did not wake up and think about my anxiety (self-check) every minute of every day.  The only side effects were weird dreams and night sweats which I could deal with because this medicine was doing wonders.
Fast-forward to last year October, things started to fall apart again.  I stopped going to work, I needed to find a therapist again, and I needed to find a psychiatrist in my hometown.  I found all of those and my psychiatrist upped my dose by 37.5 mg.  After a couple of months I started feeling better again, but now how it was for the 4 years where I finally felt normal.  The added side effect was constipation.  I go maybe twice a week which sucks, but I have been dealing.  
My anxiety has been quite bad the last two weeks.  I am scared to switch my medication because I might not find the same relief as I once did.  The thought of constantly feeling on edge, the physical pain (tightness in chest, heart pounding, tingling extremities, lack of appetite), the way my relationships and work life has been suffering scares the crap out of me.  
Has anyone had any similar experiences?  I know medication is different for everyone, but I would love to hear some success stories with switching from Effexor XR to something else.  I think my psychiatrist wants to try Prozac next, but I am reluctant to agree.  Thank you and sorry again for the length! ",1
I was recently put on Effexor XR for anxiety and Seroquel for insomnia after having a bad reaction to Prozac. I've read good things about Effexor but I've also read some not so good things about the side effects. I'm just really worried about the side effects. Especially the big one of mixing the Seroquel with the Effexor. Today is my first day of taking it. So far I'm feeling pretty tired and a slight shortness of breath (but that may be just from anxiety or the fact that I smoke). Any advice or reassurance would be nice. ,1
"Hello, lovely people of /r/Anxiety!  I went to my doctor yesterday, because I was starting to get nasty side effects from my 30mg of Cymbalta - headaches, nausea, and more anxiety (which I suspect was because it cost so much, giving me money anxiety, and then fear of getting side effects).  He switched me to 37.5mg of Effexor XR, which I started taking today.

I've read some pretty nasty things about Effexor, but I'm trying to not worry about that until I get to the point where I stop taking it (most of the nasty stuff is about withdrawal symptoms).  I know 37.5mg is a baby dose, but I took it this morning with breakfast and spent the entire day sleepy and lethargic, which is a problem I never had with the Cymbalta.  Anyone else take Effexor and have some advice?  I'm going to try taking it with dinner instead, since it gets me tired instead of wired, but I wanted to see if you guys had any experience with it.",1
"Hey Guys,
I have been on the Venlafaxine for about 8 weeks now for GAD and MDD, going from 35mg to 150mg now. Recently I have had real trouble with just falling asleep for a second or having micro sleeps at my desk at work. This seems to happen when ever I am reading something more than a few paragraphs long. I have tried drinking coffee, eating fruit and getting up and walking around. These things seem to work for a few minutes and then I am back to micro sleeping / having a brain zap type thing as I fall asleep reading things.

"I was on a bunch of medications that had major interactions and I literally needed to go to the mental hospital inpatient because 1. I was suicidal due to all the medications that were fighting each other. And 2. I was so addicted to the high dose, high potency benzos she had me on plus other medication that was extremely hard to kick. So please, take my story and make sure you aren’t getting snowed by a provider you think is trying to help. I will answer any questions and will be happy to help anyone else with their journey! 

Either way, here is my list from when I entered the mental hospital and please feel free to comment and interact. I would love to communicate! Here it goes. 

And one more thing, I am certain about the doses. They may seem ridiculous but I assure you these are all correct meds and dosages. Thank you for the read! 

1. Clonazepam (Klonopin) 2mg three times daily

2. Alprazolam (Xanax) 1mg twice daily as needed. 

3. Venlafaxine ER (Effexor XR) 225mg once every AM. 

4. Bupropion SR (Wellbutrin SR) 400mg once every AM. 

5. Hydroxyzine (Atarax) 100mg three times daily. 

6. Trazodone (Desyrel) 100mg at once at bedtime PM. 

7. Gabapentin (Neurontin) 600mg three times daily. 

8. Divalproex (Depakote) 500 mg twice daily. 

9. Lithium Carbonate ER 450mg twice daily. 

10. Olanzapine (Zyprexa) 15mg at bedtime. 

11. Quetiapine ER (Seroquel XR) 100mg at bedtime. 

Just to put this into better perspective as well, I was 18-19 while being treated by this woman with the diagnosis being fresh as well. This was about a year ago. In October of 2023, was when I entered the mental hospital due to this combination. 

Here are the meds that I came out of the mental hospital with (I have an even better group of meds now) and felt 10x more animated and myself. I didn’t feel like a zombie for the first time in 6-8 months. 

1. Venlafaxine ER (Effexor XR) 75 mg once daily in the AM. 

2. Hydroxyzine (Atarax) 50 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. 

3. Trazodone (Desyrel) 100mg once daily at bedtime. 

4. Gabapentin (Neurontin) 300mg three times daily. 

5. Quetiapine ER (Seroquel XR) 100 mg at bedtime. 

6. Lurasidone (Latuda) 40 mg once daily at dinner time. 

7. Alprazolam (Xanax) 1mg twice daily as needed. 

As you can see it’s quite a difference. I would love to see your guy’s stories and questions. I also have a different medication list now, so if anyone is interested in seeing that as well please let me know!  ",1
"So I have GAD, MDD and ADHD inattentive type and have struggled for years to find a medication that works for all 3. 

I was on 20mg xr adderall for years as a teen-young adult and although that helped my adhd, it never addressed my anxiety. I then had children and haven’t been on adderall for 10 years. 

I do have a script for Xanax for panic attacks that I use as needed. But it’s super rare. I still have half a bottle that was prescribed back in 2017 that I use occasionally.

I’ve tried Wellbutrin, Effexor and Zoloft. 
Wellbutrin gave me tremors, Effexor made me feel good during the day but then I was up all night and wanted to puke after half a dose and Zoloft made me extremely dizzy. I’m so scared to try different medications and I quite frankly get too scared by side effects to move forward after a day or two if I feel weird. What I probably need to do is take a week off of work and just push through the side effects and see how I feel but I don’t have the time for that. 

Right now I just started adderall again to address my adhd. My psych said maybe if we address the adhd then my anxiety and depression might fall into place. Yesterday I took my first 10mg xr dose and I felt great during the day—not too jittery but definitely had motivation that I’ve been lacking. The bad part though is that I was up until 2am and I only fell asleep because I took a Xanax to calm me down. My anxiety was is overdrive. 

So this morning instead of taking another 10mgxr adderall I took a 5mg ir in hopes I can sleep tonight.


I guess my question is—those who have adhd and anxiety, what do you take??? 

Thank you.

Since that time I've been getting increasing instances of dizzy/lightheadedness when I lay down, sit up from laying down, and it's especially bad when I bend over. Has anyone else experienced this?",1
"As I’m writing this, I’m currently laying in bed at 7pm having another really bad anxiety/panic attack. I feel terrible, but maybe by telling my story I can help someone else or maybe help myself feel a little better until this klonopin kicks in. 

This is going to be pretty long, and I’ll have to give some backstory and context. Not really sure if anyone will read this but if you do, thanks for taking the time and know whatever you’re going through you are never alone. Also this isn’t really going to be positive all the time, so I just wanted to give a fair warning

This is my battle with anxiety so far.

When I was growing up I always heard of different things going on in my extended family and I never really knew what to make of them. At the time I was much too young to really rationalize or internalize what was really happening. My great grandma had committed suicide before I was born, and one of my much older cousins had committed suicide pretty suddenly and unexpectedly. On my mother’s side, everyone has severe mental health issues. Depression and anxiety run rampant and relentlessly, sparing almost no one. On my father’s side it’s a similar story except instead of depression or anxiety, it’s bipolar disorder. 

I grew up watching my mom struggle with anxiety and depression. My earliest memory was before school my mom couldn’t physically get out of bed and was hyperventilating laying down. The ambulance came and we were taken to our neighbors apartment while my mom was in the hospital. My dad was a high school band director and was already at work when all this happened. 

While I was worried and scared for my mom, I don’t think I really understood what she was going through. Frankly I don’t think anyone really understands what it feels like until it happens to them. It’s something I don’t wish on my worst enemy, and it’s something I forgive people for not understanding. 

With my dad being a musician/band director, in 3rd grade I started to take French horn lessons. I was lucky to be very talented and had a fantastic private teacher who was like a grandfather to me. As a boy I had anxiety and fear, but it was always for a reason. At first I hated playing in front of people but that quickly went away, and I was off to the races in my journey as a musician.

I was extremely successful in middle school and high school, one of the best in the state of Florida. I had unshakable confidence and nothing ever phased me. At most I had some small amount of nervous energy but it quickly disappeared after whatever was causing it. My parents finally divorced when I was a senior in high school and it was a mess, but that’s an entirely different story.

I attended the Juilliard school once I graduated high school and was successful there as well. While I did have some anxiety it was very manageable and there were times I felt depressed but I was atleast highly functioning. I was miserable there, moving to NYC was a large change for me and I felt the floor drop out from under me.  

When I left school I was lucky enough to get a job playing on Broadway, fast forward a year and I was on the North American tour of Les Miserables. I had never been happier in my life. I was making an incredible amount of money, traveling the country, out of school and loving life having fun. 

When I was 22 I was playing a show in Grand Rapids Michigan and I had my first panic attack. I thought I was dying, having a heart attack. I couldn’t finish the show that I had been playing 8 times a week for over a year and could literally play in my sleep. Immediately after this first panic attack came constant crippling anxiety and paralyzing depression. Never ending and unwavering. All day, every day. Sweating, heart racing, nausea, chest pain, my hands were going numb and felt pins and needles. 

Two days later after nothing was changing, I flew my mom up to see me and went to the emergency room. When I saw the doctor I was begging for anything to help me, literally sobbing just wanting anything to help even ease the symptoms. She then told me that I had stage fright and to try acupuncture, and refused to give me anything. I was forced to take off from work and flew home.

I was lucky enough to have a girlfriend who’s family was friends with a psychiatrist in Florida or I would’ve had to wait months to get help and sometimes I feel like by then I genuinely don’t know if I would’ve made it.

I was put on Zoloft and given klonopin to take as needed and it completely changed my life. For almost 5 years I was able to go back to work and was mostly free of severe anxiety. I still had occasional panic attacks but they were manageable.

About a month and a half ago my anxiety came roaring back again in the middle of a show and was once again crippling. I was vomiting all day for almost 5 days straight, and was suffering immensely. I had to take another medical leave but this is taking much longer than the last time. My psychiatrist upped my Zoloft from 100mg to 150mg and it made everything so much worse. I felt like a zombie and the only things I felt were anxiety and depression. 

After talking to my psychiatrist again we decided Zoloft probably wasn’t the best option for me anymore. My mother takes Effexor XR and has been on it for 20 years. Currently I’m in the process of changing meds which is terrifying in and of itself. I’ve been slowly coming off of Zoloft while slowly increasing Effexor and today is day 3 of no Zoloft and only Effexor. There has been so many ups and downs and I’ll feel ok for a few days and really bad for a day or two. 

I’m so incredibly tired of feeling like this, I would do almost anything to feel normal again. It’s so hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel sometimes but one day soon I’m hoping to find it. I’m tired of feeling scared and miserable, laying in my bed feeling like I’m going to die and questioning if Im going to wake up tomorrow. I feel so off, and not myself. There are so many people I love and care about and I can’t help but feel like I’m letting them down. One day I know I will feel normal again, but I don’t know when that day will come.

I’ve got another appointment tomorrow morning with my psychiatrist, wish me luck and if anyone wants to talk to someone that’s also struggling and knows what it feels like- DM me and I’ll be more than happy to talk. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. God bless, if there truly is one",1
"I (39m) after about 15+ years of suffering with anxiety (panic attacks) went to the doc and got a script for Xanax.

Trying to make a long story short... I was depressed in high school due to being bullied + some other factors. Effexor XR was my first anti-depressant. It worked.. then I stopped taking it because I thought I didn't need it anymore. This is when my anxiety problems started. I had ZERO problems with anxiety prior to stopping Effexor XR. The anxiety mostly involved social anxiety and some generalized anxiety. I never used to have panic attacks (my current problem.) I went through just about every SSRI and SNRI without success due to side effects or inefficacy. After careful consideration I believe Effexor XR permanently ruined my brain, but I digress.

I have been suffering with these shocks for several years. Sometimes they are like a minor twinge in my brain, other times like a full blown lightning bolt type feeling throughout my body. It happens so fast there's nothing I can do to get ahead of it. The effect is instant. The larger the shock, the more likely it will send me on a series of shocks that pretty much take me out for several days, weeks even, at their worst.I have been an addict in the past to opiates (oxycodone) out of desperation to kill the anxiety I had after stopping effexor. Since getting clean, I have been a staunch believer in the ""natural way."" I have done just about everything and adopted every healthy habit I can yet I have not been able to kick these shocks. Finally I had enough and went to the doc for some meds. I really did NOT want to do this, I can't emphasize this enough. Doc said I was having panic attacks.. oddly I never thought of what I was experiencing as a panic attack but when he said this it was like a DUH moment.

On 0.5mg Xanax I went for a walk today. I realized how my entire life has been ruled and ruined by anxiety. I felt like I could think for the first time.. it was nearly that dramatic. I realized that even these minor brain twinges, which I would basically write off, are actually fairly serious and throw me off way more than I appreciate.. I had just gotten used to them, and in comparison to the bad shocks, in the moment feel quite minor.

I now find myself wondering what to do. Xanax has been so life changing for me I would gladly take it regularly, and gladly become dependent on it. After having gone through literal hell withdrawing off of opiates in the past, and being terrified of medication dependence since.. I do not say this lightly.

When I spoke to the doctor I was insistent on not taking Xanax regularly and only ""as needed"" without realizing at the time the ""as needed"" is probably all the time... lol. He said if the anxiety or panic is very frequent then an SSRI or SNRI is in order, but in my case since it is infrequent, a benzo would do nicely.   


I do not know how to approach this with my doctor. I could keep taking maybe 2 a week max and not disrupt anything.. but still suffer symptoms.. or I could ask to be put on it daily or frequently. I am terrified to do this because I feel like I could get cut off or put on another ineffective SSRI if I try to push for this. I feel like I'm walking a line here.

I really wish there was another way and I don't want to blow the script I have now. Do I just spill it to the doctor or keep on keeping on with what I got and be grateful I can get some occasional peace?

"Hello. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety 2 years ago. I've been on and off medications because they made me very fatigue, emotionless and absent. I've tried Lexapro, Zoloft, Citalopram, Effexor, Trazadone and now Wellbutrin. All SSRI's worked the same, with Zoloft being the worst, it made me a zombie who would just play smartphone games without any other interactions. Wellbutrin does work, I started it just 1 month ago. it is the best out of all. At first it gave me major muscle cramps, then elevated my tics and stims, while giving a lot of energy, I could finally wake up rested and did not have to drink caffeine to get rid of the brain fog, I also fall asleep much easier. Unfortunately the tics are bothering me even though it settled down a little but, another thing is that it does not give me any motivation and the energy levels are decreasing with each dose. I've started thinking about everything that was bothering me over my whole life, which I've never considered to be due to a mental problem, I also started reading about all the symptoms, and this with the fact that Wellbutrin makes me feel better and fall asleep easier, even though it might fall under stimulant category, made me think that I have Inattentive ADHD (ADD). 

I've talked to several different psychiatrists and all of them were just guessing and prescribing different dosages of the same medications even though I always mentioned that I feel much worse on them and all it treats is depression. I am scheduled for a follow up with the last psychiatrist who prescribed Wellbutrin and I was thinking about asking for a stimulant as a test. The only thing is that it's a telehealth probider and I'm pretty sure that prescribing controlled substances via televisit is not allowed. 
Never hurts to try though. 

I wanted to get you opinion about the type of stimulant that works best for you - Adderall XR, Vyvanse or Mydayis?

"i have smoked cannabis for the past 3-4 years and as of recently i have been trying to quit and while doing so, my boyfriend broke up with me, my cat started showing tumors and signs of cancer, and my 21st birthday was yesterday. I am on anxiety medication (Effexor XR) and have had anxiety my entire life for as long as i can remember. A few weeks ago i was dumped and began having to take my cat to the vet. 

To be clear, my anxiety before the breakup was pretty bad as well, ( as he was distant and i tried everything i could to help to no avail) but it got a lot worse after for sure. My cat who i’ve had for the entirety of my conscious life now has 3 tumors, one of which we assume to be cancerous. And to top it all off, i haven’t been smoking, which has been giving me the same symptoms as the missed dose or withdrawal symptoms of my medication without stopping or missing a dose. (excessive sweating, brain zaps, nausea, anxiety) 

having had anxiety for so long, you would think i would be able to self soothe at some point, but for some reason, my anxiety feels imminent and inescapable. I can’t think of living life without my kitty and i hurt thinking about all the good times i had with my ex (together for 2.5 years). not to mention i’m coming up on my graduation from community college to a larger university where i would have to move away from my parents.

i’m having trouble coping with the way my life is going. i’m feeling overwhelmed, exhausted and scared - even about things that are usually fun and exciting. i feel helpless and that this is going to be my life. i’m scared of living and equally scared of dying. 

if anyone has literally ANYTHING that they think would / could be helpful please let me know. i don’t know what to do anymore.",1
"My doctor recently put me on Effexor XR 37.5mg and it’s causing severe insomnia, don’t know if it’s because I can’t stop worrying about the side effects or because of the medication itself. Is this normal?",1
"As I sit here, agonizing over A or B for going on 50 minutes now, I figured I'd put the issue down to ask how ""anxious"" am I? should I be telling a doctor I'm a 9 instead of a 5? I don't feel like this all the time but if I'm not feeling confident enough to convince myself I'll go around this merry-go-round for a while. (currently on 225mg of Effexor XR since February, was on 150mg before that and Citalopram before that. I don't feel like a zombie but this accepted cynicism makes me feel like I'm losing it or have gone down a point of no return.. is that what getting older is?)

To Explain - I received a file dated for the next year. Was told in the email it was next year, it had the date in 6 other spots in the file but there was one place it said the past year so of course, someone asked it back and it’s not my file and maybe it’s lazy but 6-1 seems pretty fucking obvious to me. I was all in to say ""Yes it’s next year"" but I sat on it and teeter-totter’ed over whether to say yes or no for about 20 minutes just to ask my boss (who was also on the email) and he said to ask it back to the original person to clarify and I can’t help but think Why did I not just think to do that and be done with it? why did I think it was wise to trust what someone else was saying? why did I think about it forever, get an answer, finish it off and now decide to summarize it all to you? Venting? Sick of it all? Still annoyed and anxious. ---- Should I have been smart enough to do it the “right way”… is it even the right way? I mean I don’t really think I’m an idiot but I was convinced. It’s this unable to trust anyone and the information and having to go back and forth that I don’t truly get. If you got a question, hey look at the email chain and ask it your fucking self. Am I lazy? Am I an Asshole? I feel like I have to apologize for feeling like this which is another psycho-concept in itself (and apologize for wasting time, mine and theirs - but not for taking their money, there's not enough of that shit to go around and they print it unlimitedly).",1

Hi friends. My neuro just prescribed me Effexor to help with my anxiety and as a preventative for my migraines. I’ve only taken it for three days and I feel terrible. My anxiety is WAY worse than it was, I feel like I’m trembling, like my heart rate is through the roof, and all I want to do is sleep. Also, I feel like it gives me a little migraine throughout the day.

Naturally, it’s a Saturday so I can’t get in touch with my doctor, but was it hard to start for anyone else? Is it something I just have to push through for it to work? Or should I just stop and talk to my doctor on Monday? Help.

"Hello everyone,

Male, 30 years old

I'm an HSP (Highly Sensitive Person) diagnosed with GAD and mild social phobia. Also have sugar cravings... Motivation and brainfog problems, even more after orgasming (don't talk me about nofap please).

Two years ago, i've tried 3 antidepressants and think that these kind of medications are a double-edged sword (maybe i'm wrong)

&#x200B;

* Lexapro (escitalopram) - tried 10mg, 15mg, 20mg - 6 months (took 2 weeks to kick-in):

(+) Helped greatly with GAD, almost enough with social phobia

I loved the way it made me ""feel"" less in general and i liked the way it delays orgasm but...

(-) Hated the way it decreased my memory and killed my motivation, made me tired and lethargic.

Sleeping a lot, hard to wake up, don't care about being late at work

Still craving sugar

Increased dosage only gave stronger side effects

&#x200B;

* Prozac (fluoxetine) - 20 mg - 4 months (took 3 weeks to kick-in):

(+) Helped a little with GAD, greatly with social phobia and motivation

Decreased my high sex-drive and sugar cravings

(-) Intense rage, especially when people do shit with me

My relatives have noticed a change in my personality, more extravagant?!

Feeling weird and hypomanic when sleeping less than 8h

Stronger orgasm delay compared to lexapro

Very bad withdrawals with intense mood swings

&#x200B;

* Effexor XR (venlafaxine) - up to 150 mg - 1 month:

(+) Less anxiety than others when starting

Eating much less (strong but bearable nausea)

(-) Braindead

Farewell motivation

Erectile dysfonction

&#x200B;

Then I decided to stop taking antidepressants, change job, try meditation and supplements (bought 300$ of supplements). Only thing that helped a little was changing job (now i've a good job) but...

&#x200B;

**I still struggle with problems i've listed and think to try another antidepressant.**

**I wonder if there is something not too strong that can help me without impairing my memory /cognition, influencing too much my motivation and don't makes me rage like fluoxetine.**

**Maybe i should try brintellix/vortioxetine? Maybe i should try something different?**

&#x200B;

Thanks for your help",1
I'm on day 4 of starting effexor xr for anxiety and depressuon as well as prazosin to help keep me from waking up throughout the night but it's giving me full-blown panic attacks early in the morning. Should I stixk it out until my body adjusts to it or try something else out?,1
"I just picked up Effexor 75mg XR today. Doc said to keep taking 20mg of Lexapro at the same time as I start my 75mg of Effexor. This seems like a lot of SSRI in my system, and I worry about serotonin syndrome. Is this is a popular tapering method?

Edit: doc said to do this for two weeks, then reduce to 10mg Lexapro",1
"I’ve been adamant on fighting my anxiety through natural measures. One day on Zoloft and a terrible reaction had me terrified.

One of those natural measures was to attempt a cleansing diet in order to restore my adrenals to proper function. 

The sugar crash and removal of grain hit me HARD and either my mood dropped or my hormones dropped and I was in the scariest depressive state I’ve ever been.

Back to the ER and they gave me Ativan to calm, and we decided to try Effexor XR 37.5.

I woke up day three on it and felt wrecked. No appetite, nausea, chills, muscle weakness and brain fog. I felt like I was dying.

1 doc appt and 6 hours in the ER, I’m left with  a script for Citalopram and an antibiotic for a suspected UTI (Which I have no symptoms but a urine test showed). 

I’m terrified of the AD and even more terrified of the antibiotic. I’ve developed this fear of meds and side effects. 

Anyone started a successful life on med? If so, what was it? 

TL/DR had bad reactions to two SNRIs, scared from take the SSRI",1

"This is my first post on this sub-reddit, so I apologise if it’s long-winded but I would really appreciate some support or advice.

Since July I’ve had a really bad run with anxiety. I’ve had anxiety since I was roughly 7-years-old (I’m 21 now), but over the past few months I’ve had what many would consider to be a mental breakdown (incredibly high stress, panic attacks, insomnia, excessive worry, depression etc.) and I have taken some time off work to recover.

I’ve seen a GP, as well as two psychologists (I still see one every week), who has diagnosed me with GAD, Health Anxiety, and Panic Disorder.

They have also prescribed me Effexor XR (SNRI), which I am hesitant to take as I’m worried that it will numb me, or change who I am as a person (make me less empathetic etc.). I’ve never taken antidepressants before, so I think it’s fair that I’m a little hesitant. 

The doctors assure me that I have nothing to be hesitant about, as they will simply take the edge off my anxiety and we can monitor dosage. However, I’ve had friends who have taken SNRIs and didn’t like the way it made them feel (emotionally numb, not as sharp, fatigued etc. - but to each is own).

Through regular CBT, meditation and a diet change, I feel a lot more stable than I did a couple of months ago. I still have pretty severe anxiety, but I’m beginning to get a grip on a lot of the worries that consumed me a few months ago. It’s time for me to now return to work, and I’m having a panic attack just thinking about it (this is primarily where I need your advice).

I work in a call-centre in the insurance industry. I receive calls every day where I get abused by customers, usually because they’re frustrated with the lack of coverage on their policy or for whatever other reason.

A lot of the time I actually have empathy for the customer, but I have to do my job and abide by the policy regardless. The abuse I receive includes being sworn at, yelled at, and occasionally threatened. My work tells me that I don’t need to accept that treatment, and that I’m able to hang up on customers who are abusive. This is fine, but during these types of calls my heart rate increases and I find it ruins my day (sometimes I’m left thinking about it for days/weeks). I hate confrontation, and it seems to trigger my anxiety when I get abused.

I also feel that my colleagues and I are undertrained, and the directions we receive from management are inconsistent which makes it difficult to provide a consistent service/product to customers. This has led to a number of my colleagues resigning, and in general, the organisation has a high turnover rate.

The job is also very repetitive in nature, I take the same calls everyday and don’t feel like I’m evolving or learning much. I find that at my desk, my mind wanders in between calls and I spend a lot of time ruminating about various thoughts that give me anxiety.

It’s worth noting that leading up to my breakdown, I would come home from work everyday with an incredible amount of stress but continued to ignore it. All of the signs that a breakdown was coming were there. So a note to anyone reading this, if you feel yourself becoming overwhelmed, try to prevent a breakdown by meditating daily, and prioritising your own health. 

Anyway, I’m dreading going back to work as I am only starting to feel well enough to go on with everyday life, and I don’t know how I will cope with the stress of the call-centre, abusive calls etc.

If I decide to change jobs, I’m worried that my parents will think I’m a failure for quitting, and I feel like I would have let my anxiety defeat me or control me.

Part of this post was to vent, but more importantly ask for your advice. Do you think I have enough reason to move on from this job, or do you have a different opinion on the situation? 

Any feedback will help me out, and once again I really appreciate you taking the time to read this. Have a good day :)",1
"I have a question about possibly going on Cymbalta. Around 2006 or so I started taking Effexor XR for my depressions/anxiety and it worked decently well for around 8 years or so. I had some side-effects like dizziness and weight-gain for the entire time but around a couple years ago the side-effects got steadily worse and the benefits went away to the point where it was almost worse than when I started. Last year I tapered off of Effexor for a few months and finished around the fall. I went through the normal acute withdrawal for a month or so and then three months later I started the protracted withdrawal where my anxiety really spiked and my lower back started hurting/spasming. I've tried various things like herbal remedies, regular meditation/exercise, removal of stimulants and excess sugar, and even buspirone but nothing really works. Given all this, would Cymbalta be a possible solution? ",1
"Hi, I am 24 years old (female) and have struggled with general anxiety disorder/some very mild OCD/ ptsd for several years now. It has really worked it's way into affecting my life and personal relationships. I recently (yesterday) got prescribed Effexor XR 75 mg 1 a day as well as klonopin. Has anyone had this and want to share their experience? I took my first one this morning along with 1mg klonopin.

"I've been around here for a while, but if you've read anything about me, please read this because things keep changing.  It's frustrating and I'm going crazy.

I have:  Agoraphobia, housebound.  Panic Disorder, at least I think.  OCD, GAD.

Lately, it seems I've added:  fits of rage, impulse control problems, boundary problems, and the inability to have feelings other than bad.

I have thought for years I have had panic disorder because I've had what I believe are panic attacks, but I only get about 3 or 4 of the 13 symptoms in the DSM-IV, mostly depersonalization/derealization, some stomach issues, and intense fear, particularly of heat, driving and being trapped.  Never get racing heart, hyperventilation, shaking, etc.

Meds I've tried: Paxil, twice, Lexapro, Effexor, Anafranil, Risperidone, Xanax and Klonopin.  My doctor wants me to try Viibryd, but I've not read great things about it.  Absent that, he wants me on Abilify or Seroquel or something in that class.  I recently switched from Klonopin 3mg/day to Xanax XR 3mg/day, and it was a complete disaster.  I've had problems with Xanax before, and this time had me calling a suicide hotline.  I switched back today.

I am currently only on Klonopin, 3mg/day.

The thing is, if I once had only panic disorder and OCD, I now have all this other stuff that's making my life unmanageable.  I can't concentrate on work, so I am on leave.  I haven't been in the mood for sex in months, I go into fits of rage and have fired a doctor, then just about fired another, and am back with the previous one, smash things, yell, and am generally out of control, able to go off and say anything nasty to anyone.  This is hurting my relationships, what few I have left.

I hate my work (programmer) because I don't feel creative and it agitates me in many ways.  I can't deal with my family because they are all crazy, but I'm the craziest.  My relationship with my partner is only still hanging on by a thread because of her immense patience, although she loses it with me and comes down on me, she never leaves.

Do I have panic disorder, or did this morph into bipolar or something more serious?  How do I get back the creative, somewhat healthy person who liked himself?

Where have I gone, and who is this person here now?  I think I've lost it.

Any ideas?  Ask me questions, give me suggestions, I'm open to anything at all.",1
"  I just made a post in /r/askdocs but I figured I would ask if anyone has experienced this phenomenon. So some background, I was not during my childhood or teens diagnosed with anything other than ADHD primarily inattentive and even than that took until my junior year of high-school as my parent's didn't really think much of mental illness despite me having 2-3 full blown panic attacks per week ever since elementary school, or at least they didn't until I had a breakdown my senior year of high school and dropped out shortly after I turned 18, oh and I'm just turning 19 now in case that matters . Anyways I had a psych evaluation conducted and I was diagnosed with: 


1. ADHD primarily inattentive on the more severe side 


2. Major Depression Disorder which I only had because I had to live with untreated anxiety for so long and while mostly gone I still have it hit me every few months 


3. Agoraphobia moderate 


4. GAD moderate-severe 


5. Social Phobia severe 


6. Panic Disorder moderate (I only get attacks about once or twice a week triggered randomly in social or public situations 


To put my anxiety in perspective I just recently started 3mg Xanax (Alprazolam) daily along with the stuff I have been on for longer such as 75mg Effexor XR (Venlafaxine) and my ADHD stimulants which I also need for fatigue, 40mg Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine), 10mg Adderall IR (Amphetamine) and all of that and the added Xanax only marginally helps.


Now onto my current predicament; my cousin shot himself a few days back and I think I kind of broke. I haven't slept in 5 days but for some reason my body is not experiencing any symptoms of sleep deprivation other than very slight visual distortions off and on and tense muscles. I know it isn't anxiety or depression induced insomnia because I can distinguish those quickly as I have experienced them, however my mind isn't racing like normally would be either, and I can focus on a single task without my ADHD meds but it seems all other thoughts outside of the task at hand are absent. So when I lay down and am not performing a task my mind just kinda goes numb. It's a very alien sensation I haven't experienced before.


Also to boot I seem to have lost the ability to really process emotion more than a minuscule amount, like something happy only slightly raises my mood above my baseline state and something sad barely lowers it below baseline. I have not even been able to shed a single tear since I heard the news. I know its not depression because I have been depressed off my ass and its a lot different. I would compare it more to dissociating. Every symptom to my ADHD & all of my anxiety disorders have also been absent, or I guess I feel more like they are hibernating maybe.


Anyways anyone ever experience something similar or know anything about these things. Sorta blows not sleeping for most of a week; on that note wouldn't you think that sleep deprivation would worsen my anxiety symptoms, but its so odd, there just doesn't seem to even be a symptom to worsen. I am at a loss here -__-",1

"**TL;DR: I have had panic/anxiety for 10+ years, and can't leave a 15 mile radius.  Got sick of it decided to fight for my life back, began diet change & exercising, had 30+ pound weight loss, but now have more anxiety than when I accepted defeat and stayed in comfort zone, am now very frustrated.**

I'll try not to be too long winded here.  Even if this generates no responses, I just need to get this off my chest.  I've had anxiety and panic attacks for 10+ years, and am on 150mg of EffexorXR daily. Been to countless specialists, therapists, etc etc.   I'm currently 28 years old, and have been robbed of a lot of wonderful experiences in my life.  The past 3-4 years I just came to accept the fact that anxiety will beat me down no matter how many times I got up.  I've become completely disconnected from friends, spend most of my time at home, but a weird part of me felt better this way.  I didn't experience day-to-day anxiety and panic, and I wasn't depressed or sad.  I also wasn't happy with my lifestyle, but I just seemed to accept my fate.  I could live this way, and wasn't going to poke or prod at the giant elephant in the room, just leave him be.  It crushes me that I really had it all, good grades, great family, etc.  And I had come to a sad, secluded point where I was a human hermit, disconnected and defeated.  My best friend and closest companion was my dog....even typing that crushes me (I love dogs, but that's what my life had come to). 

About two months ago, I decided to fight back.  It's always been in the back of my mind, but one morning, something clicked.  I was 50 pounds overweight, ashamed to be seen by anyone in public, and had just had enough.  Instead of ignoring the giant elephant in the room, I wanted to pick a fight with it.  My attitude suddenly shifted to the following: Anxiety and panic wants to rob me of a life I deserve? *Fuck that*.  I'm not submitting anymore.  Let's go.

My diet went from mainly fast food (food was the one thing I had to look forward to every day) to vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, 1600-2k calories a day.  After two weeks, I began walking.  Two weeks later, I began running.  55 days since my lifestyle change, I'm down 30 pounds, have confidence, a base of proper nutrition and daily exercise as a foundation.  I've inspired my family to change as well.  It really has been amazing.  
This new attitude + lifestyle has led me to expand my boundaries.  I'm walking long distancing out of safe zones, attending some small family gatherings, and very slowly crawling back to a normal life.  The problem is, my panic and anxiety is fighting back as well.  I now experience day to day anxiety and sometimes small episodes of panic, more so than when I accepted my fate of a hermit's lifestyle.  The further I come along and push my boundaries, the harder the anxiety fights back.  Maybe this should just be obvious to me, but after a small panic episode a few hours ago, I felt a bit defeated.  The doubt creeped back into my mind, that maybe I am destined to a hermit lifestyle.  I don't know.  I just needed a place to get all of this off of my chest, even if it goes unread.  For that I thank you.",1
"Hello Reddit,

This may end up being a long one and I apologize, but I really feel the need to talk.

So I've had depression issues for most my life.  I've recently accepted that a lot of my issues stem from being the child of an addict and major abandonment and loneliness issues during my childhood.  A few codependency issues, particularly dealing with unhealthy relationships and etc.  I've been on different antidepressants for the last few years with some benefit, but things recently became worse than they ever have before.

In November, I had a pretty rough breakup.  It was completely unexpected and really hit me hard.  There were other stressors at the time as well including work and holidays.  I have a very small family now, single and no kids, so I usually look towards SOs for holiday support.  At any rate, starting then I began to have major problems with depression and anxiety.

I took my exe's advice and sought therapy.  My anxiety hit incredibly hard one day and I ended up in the ER for anxiety for the first time in my life.  I was afraid of being alone.

I was directed towards an Outpatient Program for group therapy due to my anxiety and depression.  Still barely able to control things (the one medication I was given at the ER to combat anxiety ended up giving me a seizure and not being replaced).  My PCP didn't want to change anything about my antidepressant during this time since it could make things worse.

The program helped, and eventually I was getting back to normal.  I saw a psychiatrist who had me double the dosage on my antidepressant (Effexor XR) after completing the program and returning to work.

After a week, my anxiety has returned to levels similar to when I went to the ER.  The Psychiatrist also gave me a few 0.5mg ativan that I've been using to try to dig myself out of this fear.  However in terrified of becoming addicted to them.

After the double dosage failed to help after about a week (actually made things worse) the Psychiatrist told me to cut back down to the level I was at when all this started.  This was only two days ago, but I had anxiety so bad yesterday that I was terrified to get out of bed or leave my apartment for no logical reason.

I am seeing a therapist once each week now, but I'm fairly convinced this is a chemical issue.  She is helping me, successfully, with the unhealthy issues in my life so far.  

Prior to November, I've never experienced this consistent level of anxiety.  Never without a reason.  But I've been having panic attacks all day for little reason.  Things as simple as a person not texting me back an answer immediately sends me into a panic.

I've tried a few herbal supplements.  Even tried smoking a lite amount of weed.  Nothing seems to help outside the ativan and weed.  The former being habit forming and the latter being a bit difficult to manage and maintain.  Valerian Root gave me a massive headache and lavender oil just seems to make me feel comfortably depressed.

I've got an appointment with the same Psychiatrist in two weeks, but I'm a little scared that it won't be soon enough.  Should I try my PCP again, despite receiving no aid from them so far?

TL;DR: Brand new to this persistent anxiety, been through therapy, now what?",1
"I'm already totally starting to panic about taking the bar exam...should I go to my doctor? Are there any medications that could help with short term anxiety like this? I already take Effexor XR and it helps a ton, but for something like this, I need to make sure I'm sleeping and able to focus on studying. :( ",1
"DISCLAIMER: Wall of text ahead describing myself, sorry in advance ^__^

So yeah; my psychiatrist has been diagnosing me with one mental illness after another and while I respect the med school degree hanging in there office I would still wondering whether you guys agreed with him, or that instead of all these disorders I simply have Borderline Personallity Disorder or something else.

Symptoms include and have been present since elementary school or before unless otherwise specified, oh and also I am 18 now an in the past 2 years a LOT of these have started to manifest more to the point I dropped out of highschool (despite having a far above average act score and IQ my gpa was ruined due to these disorders) and I haven't done much productive or fun since....

•The first clue that had me looking into this type of disorder was my vastly ""charged"" moods which was is a great feeling of what resembles hypomania that I get sometimes usually once triggered lasting for no more  than 6-12 hours so this led me to bipolar disorder but after dissecting what hypomania is I learned it didn't last long enough nor did it match a couple of other attributes so with bipolar disorder ruled out I had skimmed something mentioning BPP and was like ok might as well and sure enough with BPP all emotions seem to be elevated and can include the exact hypomania like trances I would get and matched with my personnality of me being exceptionally joyfull, loving, idealistic, with an enthusiasm for life but also while able to experience this elation and joy I am more often than not plagued by dysphoria which matched me with my depressive and anxiety like symptoms of feeling overwhelmed with negativity such as guilt, anger, grieving over what should have been simple sadness, shame over what should be slightly embarrassing, panic over nervousness, and anger where there should be annoyance.

•Of the four types of dysphoria associated with BPD I for the most part show symptoms of the ""fragmented self or lacking identity area"", this one rang to me because while taking solid stances on everything I truly don't know what I enjoy, desire, value, I'm often unsure of or discouraged towards any long term goals; feeling as if I exist without purpose or empty to some extent. Next is the ""feeling like I am intentionally and unintentionally being victimized at random times"" and the ""extreme emotions"" areas but fall little into the ""self destructive or harmful to self"" category

•The biggest red flag indicating Borderline Personallity Disorder that I was curious about being my EXTREME fear of rejection and negative criticism, failure or perceived failure, fear of being alone, along with moderate fear of abandonment with any friends, mild with parents, and overwhelmingly severe with girls I end up liking... I have always had a lot of this but this particularly has increased 3 or 4 times or in the last several years and I am at the age where more of the life long symptoms start to manifest. I mean I get REALLY pissed at someone for doing something slightly douchey but hide it well for fear of there opinion or any bustander's opinions and i will get REALLY REALLY attached to a girl after a few texts and a phone call, I manage to hide all of this well enough for the most part as I don't want to appear needy and clingy aka, as I truly am and the anxiety can quickly shift to depression or vice versa :/

•everything is good or bad to me; I have a firm one sided stance on every issue, event, and person; be it good or evil, wright or wrong, black or white I always take a firm stance on one side with little room for leniency and although viewpoints dont often change if I do change my stance it is usually a sudden change that shifts me to the complete other side of the spectrum on that topic.

•If someone pisses me off I will bottle up an ungodly amount of sheer rage and either later scream when I'm by myself, punch something that is likely to break a knuckle, or sometimes I manage to let it subside and go away, at least for awhile if I'm not going to be alone for awhile

•I haven't had a severe panic attack since I dropped out, back then it was a 2-3 times a week thing, since then I have only had mild and moderate attacks with one probably once maybe twice a week

•Moderate general anxiety in any sort of social enviroment from shops to restaurants, usually over some preconceived notion that I will be or am currently fucking something up and obsessive over minor physical flaws despite realistically understanding that at least to an acceptable extent that I am an attractive guy; only ever comfortable hanging out with one or two of my closest friends

•Mild-moderate anxiety and depressive symptoms when alone, meticulously going over past social interactions to see how i could have been better or if i managed to screw something up. Hopeless anhendonia esque thoughts on the future and how it doesn't get better or how i cant succeed as an adult. Profiling what I think new people i meet thought of me, what I'm doing with my life, feeling irrationally betrayed, and how out of control of my own fate I am, etc....

•Nearly crippling anxiety simply attempting to speak to attractive girls under any situation or context and while I have moderate-severe anxiety engaging any and all strangers or near strangers, people I find physically attractive are impossible.

•Semi-self destructive behaviors such as drugs and alcohol; I have not done nearly enough of anything to have more than a poly-substance dependance, just going into a haze where i dont wont to feel whatever the hell it is that I am feeling, whatever is around I will take it; going as far as stealing some of my mom's Hydrocodones and my dad's Zolpidem, then after everytime I did that (only 3 currently) proceeding to cry about how much of a shit son and a mooch I was until I sort of break, or thats not right, pause, well more like mute my emotions and lay in bed simpling feeling melancholy and slight dissociation for 2 or so days. I have reached this point at other times as well but these episodes are still in the single digit range. Also along with self harming behaviors, I was curious so I burnt myself several times on the arm with a cigarette, it was surprisingly not unpleasant, but not quite my cup of to so I won't be doing it again.

•I am fully aware of these symptoms and the severity of my emotions but yet I cannot control them more than a little 

Medications (current): 1mg Xanax XR once daily & 40mg Vyvanse once daily both of which seems to help to a larger degree than anything before but it's still not enough.

Medications (past): Prozac (made me a zombie), other SSRIs (made everything worse), the SNRIs Cymbalta and Effexor (both of which mentally helped but stiffened my muscles to where every day getting out of bed felt like crawling from a car crash), Geodon (sedated me for a whole month at the lowest available dose), Clonidine (took before school at .1mg, lowest dose, dropped my blood pressure to the point I was delirious and could hardly make out speech), Adderall, Ritalin and Focalin (made me bitchy and confrontational), Dexedrine (mild and nice but I prefer vyvanse for lasting longer, just as strong, with no uncomfortable comeup)

Sooooo...... any ideas why I am a crazy xP


EDIT: I'm bored so I'm skimming some notes I made so if I find anymore relevant info to post or if any of you want to know something just ask :)

LATER ADDED INFO: 

•Along with BPD being associated with self harm which isn't really my area it but it also mentions ill thought out, spur of the moment choices such as reckless spending which is a vice of mine..... just bought a $220 pair of business casual boots and $90 cardigan yesterday. Another thing is periods of hypersexuality aka a highly elevated sex drive that while general feels less than healthy can multiply by ten times some days which is concurrent with the accepted traits of BPD.

•From Wikipedia ""People with BPD act impulsively because it gives them immediate relief from their emotional pain. However, in the long term, people with BPD suffer increased pain from the shame and guilt that follow such actions."" Yeah that sums it up, a compulsion manifests as a sudden burst of confidence, do something that is socially acceptable but then look back afterwords in horror -____-

•More from Wikipedia ""People with BPD can be very sensitive to the way others treat them, feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness, and intense sadness or anger at perceived criticism or hurtfulness. Their feelings about others often shift from admiration or love to anger or dislike after a disappointment, a perceived threat of losing someone, or a perceived loss of esteem in the eyes of someone they value."" & ""Self-image can also change rapidly from healthy to unhealthy."" & "" While strongly desiring intimacy, people with BPD tend toward insecure, avoidant or ambivalent, or fearfully preoccupied attachment patterns in relationships, and they often view the world as dangerous and malevolent."" 

lol I just want to love someone without fearing constant imminent betrayal. As I look into it more and more I'm not seeing why someone who majored in psychiatric medicine hasn't looked into diagnosing me with this......",1
"Hi all! I wish I had thought to come here sooner. Finding a message board online to talk about anxiety, medication, and depression seems easy, but it's really not. I typed way more than I anticipated, so I placed a TL;DR where you can hop in if you'd like.

I've suffered with anxiety my whole life. I vividly remember the panic attacks from pre-school and kindergarten, being dropped off and just beside myself. My anxiety has always manifested in awful, awful stomach issues (mimicking IBS symptoms - or exacerbating them), and this happened all through my childhood. When I was 18, a significant social event with a friend from school (insanely long story - basically I was lied to by my best friend about him being my best friend for over a year) caused a minor breakdown.

I missed school for a week, and was depressed and mopey. Up until this time, my parents never thought to take me to a psychiatrist. We had always assumed I was just a nervous person, not someone with full-on anxiety. When my dad finally took me, this quack talked with me for 9 minutes and then prescribed Effexor XR 150mg - which I've come to learn is a fairly high introductory dose.

I didn't really feel different, but I didn't feel worse either, so I assumed it was working. Everything was gumdrops for a few years until I discovered the withdrawals. The doctor hadn't put my prescription in before the weekend, and I missed 2 days of the medicine. I felt like I was going to die, and like I was losing my mind. It was insanely unpleasant. Reading up afterward, I know the standard procedure for this is exactly what I went through - headaches, dizziness, disorientation, brain-zaps, the whole fun lot of them. Because of this, I felt I had no choice but to remain on Effexor.

Fast-forward a few years (November 2007), and I had a pretty bad cold. During this cold, I forgot to take my Effexor. A few days later (Thanksgiving actually) I realized it had been almost a week, and I felt absolutely no withdrawal symptoms. To this day I have no idea why that happened, but I fully went off the drug and was happy.

The next May, I was at Disneyland with some friends. I went often, and had a season pass. For some reason, we decided to go on the newly-revamped Submarines this time. I had no qualms about going inside. Once inside however, I had a total claustrophobia attack. I felt like I was going to die right there in that metal coffin. I wasn't truly underwater, and I could have asked at any time to be let out, but that's breaking one of the tenents of anxiety - letting the public know you're freaking out. So I suffered for 5 excruciating minutes, and my life took a nose-dive.

I wasn't able to function after this. I couldn't go to my job, I couldn't go to the store, I could barely even go to relatives' houses. I had massive panic disorder in a bad way, and it ruined me. I was supposed to go to Greece with my family that summer and stay with friends there, but I couldn't do it. My family went without me, and I had a breakdown. I was couch-ridden for days, unable to take care of myself or my dogs. My aunt and grandma came to take care of me, and my aunt called my doctor. He put me back on Effexor, and while it didn't help very much, it allowed me to move about a little bit.

When I finally got to see a doctor about the whole episode, they gave me Xanax, which was a miracle. I could function again, and I felt like I had my life somewhat back in order. I didn't like taking medicine so much though, and asked for Xanax XR, which they gave me. So since 2008, I've been on Xanax XR 1mg and Effexor XR 150mg. I still have panic episodes, and I'm not able to do certain things, but I'm able to live a mostly basic life without freaking out.

Unfortunately, this past and upcoming year aren't going to play nicely. Last year my grandma passed away, and we were extremely close. I held her hand as she spent the middle of the night dying, and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I put my big-boy pants on and made a car-trip to Colorado for her memorial (I live in Southern California), and I'm so glad I did. I only had one incident and it was definitely worth it.

TL;DR

This year, in about 2 weeks, I'm going to Washington, D.C. with my family to inter my grandma's ashes with my grandpa's at Arlington National Cemetery. I haven't flown in a plan since I was 18, and the anxiety and dread that's been on me since I agreed to go is something awful. In July, we're going to Colorado again for a family reunion to celebrate with my grandma's family. On top of that, my sister got engaged and plans to be married in Hawaii in August, so that's another plane trip. I truly don't feel like I can miss either of these events, and I'm basically forcing myself to go, but it's giving me some heavy, heavy anxiety and depression currently. The cherry on top of all this is that my family is most likely moving to Colorado in the fall, due to the financial situation in California (it's balls-expensive to live here). I was born and raised in the town I'm currently in, and the thought of leaving it all behind (family, friends, familiarity) is playing havoc with my mind.

And, on top of all that, my ongoing sources of anxiety and depression: the guilt of not living up to anything for my parents, the guilt of them basically taking care of me financially, the frustration of not being able to find a job that I can perform, the stress of having bills that I hate asking help for, the fear of leaving here soon, the guilt and frustration of not being adequate and not being able to explain that inadequacy to family members...the list could go on.

I've been trying to find a therapist since I lost my insurance, but it's proving difficult. I'm with an Obamacare prototype for my county, and the system is so congested that it takes months just to get referrals. I not only want to go to therapy so I have some form of help, but I also want to be off Effexor so, so badly. I despise this drug and everything about it. The makers of it should be tried in the Hague. I gained almost 100 pounds when I started taking it, and I haven't been able to lose a pound since, despite massive dieting. I sweat at the slightest provocation, especially during the night. My body temperature is actually lower than normal, but I'm constantly feeling 10+ degrees hotter than anyone else. All these symptoms have been with me for over 10 years, and they all started with this damn drug.

My plea for advice is twofold:

- Has anyone successfully dropkicked Effexor out of their lives, and if so, how? What can mitigate the awful, terrible feelings it gives when you don't take it?

- What suggestions would you have for me about this year, in terms of dealing with all of the life-changing situations at once (and also flying)?

Sorry that this was such a novel, it wasn't my intention. I hope the massive bit of expounding on myself can help some of you understand me a little better. Thanks in advance for any help!",1

Why am I even surprised anymore,1
"There’s plenty of evidence that clomipramine’s at least modestly more effective than SSRIs for OCD, and that’s well-known across the board. The reason it’s not prescribed as much as a first-line agent is because it has worse potential side-effects. But that doesn’t change anything. Clomipramine is the gold standard for obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders period. Selective dopamine-receptor antagonism might be part of the reason certain antipsychotics (risperidone, Abilify) are prescribed for SRI-refractory OCD alongside but clomipramine’s straight-up an inhibitor of D1, D2 and D3 all on its own already. So that might be part of its unique benefit, and why people on clomipramine are less likely than people on an SSRI to need atypical-neuroleptic augmentation for OCD. And why people who take both clomipramine and risperidone (maybe even aripiprazole) are living in anti-OCD heaven. They’ve made it up there and they’re balling, living their best lives. Balloons and healthy, sane amounts of detergent, Dettol and tea-tree oil galore. Intrusive dark thoughts and unpleasant sexual arousal or compulsive urge to bleach their hands (etc.) practically deleted. I hear the chicken’s a million times better up there, too.

 A lot of people like to shit on older drugs apart from amitriptyline either because of enduring myths about tyramine-crises and need for tough diets (non-selective MAOIs) or heavier side-effects (tricyclics besides nortriptyline) but they do tend to actually be superior. Even though we live in the Prozac era and often over-value milder antidepressants.

Clozapine’s an atypical antipsychotic that’s notoriously difficult to tolerate (fluvoxamine might help with the metabolic side-effects inherent in it, though) and fraught with so many side-effects but it has a double-whammy of being one of the best antipsychotics on the market (if not the best) and by chance also one of the newest antipsychotics, the gold-standard atypical (besides-which only olanzapine and risperidone, the last time I checked, were equivalent or better in terms of actual therapeutic efficacy to haloperidol and other first-gen. antipsychotics). So even in the face of obvious therapeutic superiority it’s still not a case of newer = better-tolerated/less side-effect-heavy and older = worse-tolerated. Tricyclics, MAOIs and venlafaxine are much better than SSRIs and there’s no getting away from that. SSRIs shouldn’t be first-line for someone with severe illness/who’s hoarding like there’s no tomorrow just because ‘oh, y’know, less side-effects, less chance of fatal ODing’. Wasting time on drugs of only partial efficacy and not getting much better is more likely to drive someone to complete suicide than having a month’s supply of clomipramine in their cabinet. Most suicides are not the result of overdose anyway.

So why would sertraline be first-line for a hoarder? Just in case they want to take an overdose, so that there’s less chance of them successfully killing themselves but less chance of them actually getting better? What kind of a stupid thing is that?",1
"If someone is on venlafaxine & doing well then I’ll keep it.

I very rarely start it because I’ve had such a hard time getting people off of it due to the withdrawal.

In my experience, desvenlafaxine can have withdrawal but it doesn’t seem to be as profound",1
"I would recommend reading this from Ken Gillman
Venlafaxine: an enduring SNRI myth

https://www.psychotropical.com/venlafaxine-an-enduring-snri-myth/",1
Maybe I'm misunderstanding your comment. Effexor XR is better tolerated than IR and in one RTC was even more effective. And the limited studies out there looking at it in gastric bypass patients didn't show any significant difference in bioavailability between XR or IR,1
"I had the same question early in training. Empirically, it works. Likewise, while people assume atomoxetine is going to be energizing and stimulating, it's actually reasonably common to see sedation/somnolence. My suspicion is that much like we see with its cousin dopamine, tonic vs phasic release have different effects, such that consistently boosting the baseline is not the same as enhancing burst-firing.

This paper tackles this ""norepinephrine paradox"" [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4780187/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4780187/) and notes:

* RCTs consistently indicate that fear of NRIs aggravating anxiety is overblown
* NE has complex interplay with other monoamines, so presumably does all kinds of stuff
* panic disorder and PTSD are marked by normal baseline noradrenergic tone with exaggerated response to NE
* MDD may have low basal NE tone, and thus a relatively increased phasic NE response to a threat
* much like SSRIs produce slow presynaptic effects, NRIs may affect presynaptic autoreceptors and inhibit phasic firing even as they increase tonic firing, decreasing the magnitude of anxiety relative to a stimulus",1
i think our collective issue is that we would bring it up to her that we weren't taught that way or we would ask for clarification or some article to back up her statements and she would just argue more. we want to learn the fundamentals and not isolated examples. we have spoken with the program director regarding the situation. ,1
"Hi everyone, I take 150 mg of Effexor XR (XR-important to note) - I think I forgot to take it this Morning and I’m kind of freaking out. Is this life threatening or am I going to go crazy",1
"I recently started effexor XR 37.5mg once daily, I am 18M and have felt moments of raging anger, faster breathing and EVERYTHING is irritating me.

I’m a week in on Effexor xr and I’m having horrific panic attacks in the night. I’m surprised I’m alive that’s how bad I feel. Does it pass eventually?,1
"I've just come up on the 3 month marker of when I took my last effexor pill and recently my anxiety and exhaustion levels have been awful. I keep trying to remind myself that it's temporary and still likely just my brain adjusting because it's a lot of intrusive thoughts and baseless anxiety. But it's making it hard to do my weekly hormone injections, I've managed it the last couple weeks but just have started getting anxious about it. I know I'll feel worse if I don't take it though, so I usually am able to power through it. It's the mental hurdle of having to go do it that I get stuck in.

Work has been exhausting and making things worse and I applied for a new job today after having to hype myself up for weeks, committing to the potential change was hard though.

My sensory processing disorder and the general symptoms of autism that I've struggled with before are more pronounced now than when i was on effexor, though were still there.

Day to day stuff has been a struggle. I had to call in sick to work today because I was so exhausted and too sore to manage today, and I'm not looking forward to having to be up and out the door by 10:30 tomorrow for therapy, because I much rather just sleep a lot, but I have trouble getting to bed at a decent time. My executive function is all over the place.

I don't want to get on another med though this soon, so I'm just trying to find ways to manage. A new job will help a lot, but financially I'd dislike quitting before I get a new one. I work fast food and we're in our busiest season and my coworkers make things all the more difficult.

More of a vent than anything. Maybe someone else will have a similar timeline with their own withdrawals. It's exhausting though",1
"Hello! I take Effexor Xr, and I’m on 225mg/day. I usually take it during the night a couple hours before bed. Have y’all found it to be more helpful during the night, or morning? Is it helping at all? Thanks! ",1
"i feel like ive tried everything for years and it all makes me gain weight but whenever i wasnt on antidepressants i felt a lot better about myself physically and my appetite was normal, right now im on Effexor XR 150mg and i feel like it may be contributing to my weight gain (for reference i was always around 120-125lbs and since my hospitalization in December i’ve gained about 20 lbs",1
"So my case is quiet complicated, in 2021/early 2022 I developed tardive dyskinesia and so I made the decision to stop all psych meds. Now a few years later my OCD returned with vengeance,I have panic attacks and anxiety, Since Sep 14 of this year I started taking Effexor XR along with Ingrezza, I keep having obsessive thoughts that ingrezza will block and over power the SNRI, That is because VMAT2 inhibitors (ingrezza) deplete monamines. However it can also be said that Ingrezza works mainly on the striatum niagrum while Effexor works on the cerebral cortex, meaning maybe these drugs each work on different areas. I also read that Austedo (another VMAT2) increases serotonin release by 5-HT7 antagonism. So now I am honestly confused, last week I was feeling great, my anxiety went down,I stopped being impuslive, my intrusive thought calmed down but this week all the positive effects vanished. I told my psychiatrist and he told me 5 weeks is too early to tell, he said to give it 12 week",1
"Hi guys, I suffer from extreme anxiety/panic and depression and a little bit of ptsd. I currently take 300mg of Effexor and 2mg of Xanax XR every night but I'm always sleeping, I feel no motivation, I'm always sad, no happiness so my doctor added rexulti for me. I haven't taken it yet (waiting for insurance to cover it) but I was hoping to hear some success stories from taking rexulti",1
So I have generalised anxiety disorder and depression. I was on so many medications before but with little to no effective. I am currently taking Wellbutrin 150 mg and Trintellix 20 mg and feel so much anxiety every day from dusk till dawn to the point where I get panic attacks and feel so awful and so stresfull. What should I do? I cannot take Xanax or Clonopin every day because they can cause addiction and stop working cause they are benzodiazapines. I was thinking to change Trintellix to Effexor Xr but my doctor tells me to give Trintellix a time... What should I do? ,1
"so let me start by saying, i’m on state insurance and where i live there’s not a ton of great options for psychiatrists. 

about 2 years ago i met with a psychiatrist, im not sure exactly how it worked but i only saw her for my intake appointment and then got transferred to a different one for long term care. 

these were my problems : 
binge eating 
social anxiety 
trouble controlling my emotions(specifically rage)
lack of motivation 
hard time paying attention 
and even harder time starting tasks 
low sex drive 
overstimulation 
brain fog 

she prescribed me lexapro, i didnt know much about antidepressants and was very motivated and optimistic. so i took the lexapro as prescribed. she prescribed me 10mg for 2 weeks and then had me bump it to 20. knowing what i know now, SSRIs can take up to 6 weeks or more to see improvement so i should’ve stayed on a lower dose and tweaked things as it actually set in. also 20mg as far as i know is the highest dose or one of for lexapro. again, it was my first time on antidepressants and i trusted her. 
if i knew what i know now, i would have been skeptical. 
i took it for about a year and i think i wanted it to work more than it was actually working so i kept trucking. i struggle with chronic fatigue (Crohns disease) and it definitely worsened all my symptoms i came to her with. eventually i started taking wellbutrin which kind of helped but only in the way that it counteracted the really negative side effects of the lexapro. 

i’ve done a lot of research since that first appointment 2 years ago, and me and my dr decided i would try to ween off. i successfully did in about 6 months (that 2.5 mg was rough). now im basically back to square one. this week i have an appointment with my psychiatrist and im going to bring up SNRIs bc i kind of think that’s what i should have been on to begin with. 

do any of you struggle with similar things and have had success taking an SNRI? 
i know antidepressants are very individual but im just looking for recommendations to bring up at my appointment! thanks guys!

Edit : i dont struggle with general anxiety, mostly social anxiety and overstimulation so it’s pretty situational. 
i think she thought my main issue was depression bc i talked about not being able to get out of bed. but its not really in a depression way it’s more like executive dysfunction. i WANT to get out of bed but my brain is like No 🫡

EDIT 2 : my dr prescribed Effexor XR. i know there’s a lot of horror stories but i’m hopeful!",1
"So I have GAD, MDD and ADHD inattentive type and have struggled for years to find a medication that works for all 3. 

I was on 20mg xr adderall for years as a teen-young adult and although that helped my adhd, it never addressed my anxiety. I then had children and haven’t been on adderall for 10 years. 

I do have a script for Xanax for panic attacks that I use as needed. But it’s super rare. I still have half a bottle that was prescribed back in 2017 that I use occasionally.

I’ve tried Wellbutrin, Effexor and Zoloft. 
Wellbutrin gave me tremors, Effexor made me feel good during the day but then I was up all night and wanted to puke after half a dose and Zoloft made me extremely dizzy. I’m so scared to try different medications and I quite frankly get too scared by side effects to move forward after a day or two if I feel weird. What I probably need to do is take a week off of work and just push through the side effects and see how I feel but I don’t have the time for that. 

Right now I just started adderall again to address my adhd. My psych said maybe if we address the adhd then my anxiety and depression might fall into place. Yesterday I took my first 10mg xr dose and I felt great during the day—not too jittery but definitely had motivation that I’ve been lacking. The bad part though is that I was up until 2am and I only fell asleep because I took a Xanax to calm me down. My anxiety was is overdrive. 

So this morning instead of taking another 10mgxr adderall I took a 5mg ir in hopes I can sleep tonight.


I guess my question is—those who have adhd and anxiety, what do you take??? 

Thank you. 

Edit: Crossposted ",1
Is anyone on the combination of Effexor XR and Wellbutrin? How do you feel? Is it good for both depression and anxiety? ,1
"This is really more of a rant than anything.  I've been on AD meds since my major depression diagnosis 23 years ago.  Went onto venlafaxine probably 8-10 years back.  Decided in the Fall of 2022 that I wanted to get off the 300mg/day.  It was working insofar as the depression was at bay, but my motivation was ""off-scale"" low.  So my doc added wellbutrin.  The wellbutrin restored much of my motivation.

Once the wellbutrin settled in, I started reducing the venlafaxine.  I'd read that it's a major PITA to wean off of, and I'm here to attest to that fact.  Over the next 18 months I started cutting the daily dose in half.  I got down to 1/4 of a 75mg pill and have been at that dose for nearly 8 months... 18.75 mg/day.

The first week of March I dropped the venlafaxine completely.  Everything was copacetic for about 5-7 days, then sh\*t went off the rails.  I found myself getting emotional/upset for no reason.  Example: I was talking to a co-worker about watching ""Masters of the Air.""  I was explaining I didn't want to watch it because many years back I was profoundly affected by the ""Amazing Stories"" episode ""The Mission"" (where the bombardier on a B-25 was trapped in the belly of the plane and the landing gear had failed and they were running out of fuel).  Tried to explain that plot to my co-worker who'd never seen it and I nearly lost it.  He recommended I give Masters of the Air a ""hard pass"".

What I was experiencing wasn't really a feeling of depression, just an overwhelming exaggeration of emotions.  2 days ago I threw in the towel and began taking the 1/4 pill of venlafaxine again.  My emotional state snapped back in line within 12 hours.

So I'm frustrated that I can't get off the venlafaxine.  I'm also somewhat surprised that the low dose I'm on is making that much of a difference in my mental state.  Anyone else experienced this?  Any advice for getting off the venlafaxine from here?",1
"I don’t know if this is to vent or what but here goes. 
First time poster. I am a 35 year old male and was diagnosed with MDD as a 15 year old. I was given Zoloft and all was well. For some unknown reason, the family doctor switched all of us (My whole family has clinical depression to varying degrees) to Effexor XR when I was 19. Still, it controlled my depression so I was fine with it. 
In 2015 I caught a really, REALLY severe case of Viral Meningitis that caused severe encephalitis. All my EEGs were wildly abnormal and I was completely nuts, totally out of touch with reality. This experience completely fried my brain. They never discovered the identity of virus that caused the infection but I was hospitalized for over a month while my medical team hoped the virus would clear and the swelling around my brain would normalize. It eventually did and I was discharged home. The recovery out of the hospital was worse than my scattered memories of my time in the hospital. I physically could not fall asleep and after three weeks of begging was finally given Trazadone (thank God) along with my steady stream of my newly prescribed opioid pain killers and Valium. Over the next two months I slowly recovered from the worst of it. I got off the opioids but still take trazadone to this day. I went back to work and tried to begin life again. 

However, I was not the same person I was before the meningitis. Anxiety (which had never been a problem for me before) joined my depression, which sadly was no longer responding to the Effexor. I found a great psychiatrist and we have tried almost everything with no effect. Welllbutrin, Zoloft again, Seroquel,Mirtazapine, Lamictal, Pramipexole, Lexapro, pretty much everything under the sun. The next two years was just a roller coaster of meds and shitty side effects. I eventually was given Xanax which at least kept me functional despite the fact I am completely chemically dependent on it now. I did a whole round of TMS and felt nothing. I am now classified as “Treatment Resistant.”

My psychiatrist is frustrated and said to me that beyond a few more drugs and possibly MAOIs, ECT is where we are headed. I am not against ECT but I am absolutely just exhausted fighting this battle. It’s been seven years living like this. I make it to work and excel there but I feel like I have withdrawn from life. I was always the social butterfly but now I just sleep my weekends away. I recently started going back to therapy and am doing ketamine infusions but I just feel stagnant and I can’t see myself doing this forever. I don’t want to die but I definitely don’t want to continue living like this. 

In addition to my Effexor, Trazadone and Xanax my psychiatrist just prescribed me Caplyta, which is relatively new and based on what I have read, used primarily for Bipolar Depression. I pray to God it works because I don’t want to just exist anymore. I want to get back to living my life. 

Does anyone have positive experiences with ECT? Is there something I have missed? I feel like I am running out of road here. Any outside insight would be welcome.",1
"Hi, so I’m in a psych hospital at the moment and they’re changing me from Venlafaxine XR 225mg (SNRI) to Paroxetine 20mg (SSRI). In 6 days, I’ve been tapered from the highest dose (225mg) to 0mg and I feel absolutely awful. Im taking the Paroxetine at the same time in increasing increments but I’m getting horrible electric shocks in my brain whenever I move my eyes and I feel pig sick. Is this a normal regime for tapering Venlafaxine XR? What can I do?",1
"Hey guys, I really need to vent. I'll do my best to keep it as short as possible.

I've been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember but lately it got the best of me- my panic attacks were long gone but I was spiraling into panicky thoughts almost daily. I started getting sick a lot and I was constantly nauseous or emotionally on edge. If I noticed that stress was causing this problem I would start therapy sooner and I would probably deal with this by chaning my habits to more healthy without the need to be medicated, but since I was already in a bad state when I visited psychitatrist she decided to put me on Effexor XR. I took 35.5 for the first 10 days and then I moved to 75, currently I've been taking it for almost five weeks.

First two weeks were hell, whatever was happening to me prior taking medication was out of proportion when I started taking it. I couldn't eat, I was so nauseous that drinking water made me feel like I'll throw up, my throat felt stiff and swollen and don't even get me started on heart palpitations, sweating, shallow sleep, muscle spasms and aversion to food. I spent two weeks lying on the floor and waiting for this to pass. It was unbearable. I even paid some dumb sum of money for phone consultation with my psych only to hear that it's normal and I need to wait it out. And if I have problem with her methods I can switch doctors. Anyways, I waited it out.

I could clearly tell when the medication started to work properly because between week 2 and three my anxiety started to go down, even though I didn't regain my apetite I was able to eat a little bit more easily, sometimes I even enjoyed it. Physical symptoms of my anxiety were gone, sadly along with my sex drive. For the next few days the only thing I found remotely enjoyable was lying down and doomscrolling. I still forced myself to go out for a walk daily but it felt like a chore. Same with showering and eating. I didn't have motivation to even turn on the TV or xbox.

After few days of this apathy something shifted and this brought me to the state I'm in now (currently between week 4 and 5 of being medicated). Anxiety is still gone, but my thoughts are racing like crazy, constantly. You know this expression about having a train of thoughts? I have at least five. Each going in different direction, they're more like floating spaghetti monster of thoughts. Not a train. But I digress. I have SO MUCH energy it's scaring me, constantly feeling like I have to do something, regardless of how tired I should be. My sleep is crap too, I can't remember last time I slept 7 huours. Usually I get between 4 and 6. Falling asleep takes ages and I wake up at least couple of times per night. It feels like I'm too excited to fall asleep, even if I slept 4 hours on the previous day. I find myself dancing uncontrollably for half an hour or rushing to go out for a late night run (and both of these activities are very out of character for me). Effexor toned my emotions down to the point where I can't cry at all, sad situations don't sadden me and happy news don't move me at all. I can tell how these are supposed to make me feel and I can fake it but I'm not emotionally affected at all. I lost my drive to do things I was passionate about and unless I get into a rabbit hole of obsessively reading about something for hours I'm not interested in doing anything at all. But not in a sad, depressed way. I'm just... indifferent. Which is extremely confusing paired with the fact that I feel like a volcano of energy both physically and mentally. I'm a civilized person so I won't randomly scream in the middle of the day but I feel constant urge to scream. Or throw something. Or punch a hole in the wall with my head. I never self harmed but recently I realised I keep digging my nails into my palms, especially when stuck somewhere motionless where I can walk around or use this energy in any other way. I cought myself doing it on the train and when in lectures. I cut my nails last night because I noticed my palms were hurting in these spots and I had small cuts from my nails on my arms. Also, the nightmares. I used to rarely remember my dreams but now I'm getting nightmares almost daily. There are nights when my SO has to wake me  up, because my panicky breathing and scared mumbling wake him up. This is not normal. Is it?

And my focus, holy shit. I was out from work for 3 weeks and when I came back I relalised I can't focus for longer than 2 minutes. I know it's bad. I know there will be consequences. I know I can't keep coming up with execuses why I need extension on my deadlines but I just c a n n o t. Even now, I've been sitting at my PC for hours and I did 10 minutes worth of work. I can't live like this.

I have another psych visit on Friday and I plan to ask her to take me off these meds ( I read somewhere that withdrawals from venflaxine are hell), but if she wants to put me on anything else I'll refuse. I'm in therapy now, I learned a ton,  I know I need to give myself time to rest, I know I need to take care of my sleep schedule and I need to start eating healthy and frequently. But along with having to keep a job and dealing with the ever growing list of shit I got to do I can't be on medicine that makes me feel like this. I can't function. I want to scream. To run a maraton. I wish I could just break down and cry but I fucking can't because SNRIs apparently prevent that too. I really want to deal with my anxiety but I can't even imagine how am I supposed to learn how to fight it when it's hidden behind this medication inducted numbness.

If you read through that please, reach out. Please tell me it'll pass. Or that I'm just panicking and nothing is wrong. I now I need to get my shit together and work but I've been back from my sick leave for a week and every day it's the same. And I can't even talk to people close to me, because after a month of telling them how bad I feel I know I'm just hurting them. There's nothing they can do except loving and supporting me and making them my emotional punch bags is not fair but I feel like I'm going to explode with these thoughts. It's getting worse and worse, unless I'm overreacting. Please, tell me I'm not alone in this. Being nauseous from stress sucked but not nearly as much as being whatever the fuck I am now. Please.",1
"I’m on 300mg Wellbutrin and while it doesn’t combat my anxiety as well as I’d like, apart of me doesn’t want to stop it. It is the only antidepressant that hasn’t given me crazy side effects and I like that it aids in weight loss. 

A few months ago I had a 3 month check up with my dr and he suggested switching to Effexor XR. After research and side effects/withdrawal horror stories later I decided against it. Now, I’m having second thoughts but still hesitant. 


I started my antidepressant journey with my previous doctor. I remember my prev doc started me on lexapro and afterwards I remember the next trial the antidepressant  started with an E but I never remembered the name. Now I’m wondering if it was effexor. Is this something that a newbie (2017) could take? After I tried that, I started Wellbutrin and stayed on it. 

I eventually stopped taking it and it wasn’t until my gyno was pretty concerned and filled my script that day to start it again. (Depression screenings are done at every annual) she told me to call my PCP so he can continue filling my scripts. 

I went to a new office. Although doctor visits make me so nervous to the brink of blacking out, I love my doc. When I met him I was going through a really hard time and hit one of my biggest/longest depressive episodes. Second time we met I was hysterically crying. 

Once things started clearing up and major anxiety started creeping up, we tried out new medications. Zoloft, Prozac, and I declined retrying lexapro. After trying both meds for two long long months each, they were a flop. 

Now I can’t say this was the EXACT convo my doctor and I had (black outs) but I’m almost certain he said since we had tried the “main ones” (he didn’t say it like this I just can’t think of the word) he would like to start me on EffexorXR. After feeling like shit the past four months prior, I was already not ecstatic about starting new meds and dealing with the side effects. I was going to suck it up and do it until I read more about it then I started getting hesitant. It also seemed like this was a last resort option for my doc as in he was hoping the Zoloft or Prozac would’ve helped so he wouldn’t have to put me on Effexor. 

I called the office and spoke to my doc, explaining my hesitancy and asked to just go back on Wellbutrin. Well here we are now. 

Where I’m at now:
- my anxiety causes me to black out all the time now. My boss called me into his office to give me a raise and I blacked out. 

- I do not see my friends/go out with them/ or even hang at their house. I literally say to myself: why hang out on someone else’s couch when I can do the same thing on my own. Because you’ll be spending time with your friends, asshole! (This has actually caused me to lose friendships)

- literally can’t go on a date or hold a conversation Bc my anxiety takes flight and I overthink everything. 

- Ive become such a perfectionist it’s inhumane. I do twice the workload at work because I need it done my way. I’ve taught my coworker how I do it, but they still put their own twist on it and I will literally redo it. I also think I need to have the most perfect life. I realize this is impossible but I can’t stop the thoughts. Perfect job. Perfect appearance. Perfect relationship. It’s so unrealistic I basically disappoint myself on purpose. 

Honorable mentions:
- I suffer from migraine and ED’s. 
- I’m also on 25mg adderall XR & BC w/o estrogen. 

So obviously I’m a whole hot mess. 

Do you guys think Effexor will help me? 

Should I stay on Wellbutrin for depression and try adding something for my anxiety?

Was it right for my prev doctor to start me on effexor after only trying one other antidepressant in my life? (If it was Effexor. If there’s any other antidepressants beginning with an E please lmk. I’m also going to try calling his office)

If you’ve read this far, thanks for listening.",1

hey just a quick question for anyone who’s been on effexor xr. i’m on 37.5mg right now it’s been 2 weeks but i’m just wondering if i should up the dose to 75 just to make sure i get the benefits. i hear increasing to 75 is more effective for people. so should i wait it out and see if the 37.5 works or should i start the 75 to really get the benefits? would 37.5 even help that much? thx,1
"It’s been two weeks now since I’ve successfully weaned off of my Effexor XR. I was on 375mg and then 300mg for a combination of 7 years. It helped bring me back from the lowest point in my life, and combined with DBT therapy, literally saved me. Since I’ve been on Effexor, I finished my grad program, met my husband, and got married. Now we are considering having kids and Effexor is not pregnancy safe, so with help from my psychiatrist, I weaned off of my Effexor. It wasn’t as painful as I expected. A lot of fatigue, body aches, night sweats, and some mood issues, but nothing too life altering. 

Now it’s been 2 weeks, and I don’t have high hopes for this new normal. I’ve had one severe panic attack, and half a dozen days of intense mood swings (the kind where I end up in bed crying all afternoon.) One started just because I couldn’t find an extension for our vacuum cleaner. I freaked out and started down the classic “I’m a fuck up” spiral. Historically, my biggest issues were always self-directed anger and feelings of hopelessness. 

After experiencing mood issues so rarely for years, it’s disturbing to have so many problems in just 2 weeks. I had hoped it was period related (since it coincided at one point) but its seeming more like it’s related to stopping the Effexor. I’m trying to use my DBT skills to offset some of the mood issues, but I’m also experiencing IBS problems again (which I’ve struggled with all my life and is directly related to my mood), which make me physically ill as well. I wasn’t even aware my Effexor had been helping with my IBS to the degree that it was. 

It’s hard to fight this battle on both an emotional and physical front, all while not knowing... is this the new normal? Is this just me? And the worst part is I’m still on 10mg of Lexapro, and my plan had been to cut antidepressants out completely before trying to get pregnant. Now that’s looking less possible. I’m terrified of what I could be like without *anything.* After years of feeling so normal and healthy, it’s disturbing and disheartening to realize just how dependent on my medication I actually was. I told my psychiatrist about these concerns and she just did the whole “diet, exercise, sleep, meditation” routine, which I get, but I also worry isn’t enough to help stave off the worst of my demons.",1
"I've been experiencing migraine headaches for over 4 years now, and nerve pain/tingling for a little over a year. I've seen three different neurologists about it.

The first one I saw, in January 2019, floated the idea of antidepressants like nortriptyline as a preventative medication. We ultimately decided that I was too young (19) and my symptoms weren't that bad- at that point they had started to subside, after being in near constant pain and panic for over 2 weeks.

A few weeks later the headaches and nerve pain came back, and I ended up in the ER. I was prescribed some baribiturate painkiller for the headaches, but then I found out what barbiturates were and chickened out. Never filled the prescription.

I white-knuckled it on OTC painkillers for the next 3 months, until I had another really bad episode. I went to the campus health center and was prescribed sumatriptan, which seems to work pretty well for the migraines (at least for a while) but did nothing for the nerve pain.

The second neurology appointment was in July 2019. I was told that my symptoms were probably tied to my anxiety disorder and was referred to a psychiatrist, but they didn't take my insurance and there was no time to find another one before I went back to college in another city.

A month ago, my depressive symptoms started getting worse and I went to the psychological services center on campus. I started working with a psychiatrist, who gave me some suggestions for medications. At our second appointment, I brought up nortriptyline and she prescribed it for me, telling me to taper onto it. I picked it up, but then I read more about the side effects and chickened out.

The third neurology appointment was yesterday. She agreed with the second neurologist that the headaches and nerve pain were related to my anxiety disorder, and prescribed me Effexor XR (37.5 mg) for all of these. She told me to start with one tablet per day for a week and then start taking two (75 mg) per day. She also upped my dose of sumatriptan to 50 mg, and said that as long as I took the sumatriptan twice a week or less, I wouldn't have to worry about serotonin syndrome.

I contacted the psychiatrist on campus about it and she told me to start the Effexor with dinner today, even though I said I wanted to hold off because I have a big day Monday and don't want to be dealing with side effects.

Am I right to be concerned that I'm just being handed antidepressants like this? I know that the psychiatrist and neurologist are the experts, but I'm still scared to just start a medication against the warnings I've read.",1
"Yeah. I've hardly had any luck with SNRIs, albeit I was supposed to start Fetzima, but my insurance wouldn't cover it, yet they'll cover Effexor? I'm trying not to lose hope in antidepressants.

I have to be on an antidepressant to continue my Spravato treatments that I started recently. I'm hoping Effexor ends up helping rather than making my depression worse, like Pristiq and Viibyrd did",1
Can anyone tell me if I'm fine to take it. I feel like death right now and Benadryl helps me a lot. ,1
"Hi Docs!
I’m 58F, have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis controlled with Levo. I saw my endo because something didn’t feel right on my neck, I thought maybe thyroid related. He said no and referred me to ENT, they did ultrasound which showed a heterogeneous pocock septated mass. He then sent me for a CT scan it it showed nothing abnormal. It’s still happening and I just don’t want to ignore something I know isn’t normal. I have already schedule a recheck to discuss it in 10 days with the ENT. The spot is always tender when I press on it, it’s just on the right side of my trachea. I always slightly feel it when I swallow or move my head a certain way but when my chin is tucked a bit it “pops” as well. Of course I will do what the doctor recommends, but that’s 10 days from now! Any thoughts on what’s going on and maybe what kind of test would you recommend to figure this out. It feels more in my neck, not my throat. This issue has been going on for about 4 months. Only other meds I take are atorvastatin and EffexorXR. Thank you for any insights you may have. ",1
"\[43M\] I was prescribed Effexor XR in 2020 and experienced immediate tremor, twitching, stuttering, and anxiety. After a few weeks I gave up on the medication, but these symptoms have continued. We have since found that Lamotrigine and Propranolol halt the symptoms as long as I'm taking them, but it's stressful not even knowing if this condition has a name and I'm worried about it progressing. If I miss a dose the symptoms are severe enough that I can't function: head twitching side to side, uncontrollable urge to hug myself and rock back and forth, and hand tremors that worsen when I try to hold objects or move them. I have fallen down the stairs multiple times. The anxiety is overwhelming and I usually have to lie down until the late dose takes affect again. When I am on the medication there are no noticeable symptoms.

I have read that Effexor abuse can lead to these symptoms, and that autism may be a risk factor for Parkinson's. This makes me wonder if a common mechanism is involved. The anxiety symptoms make me think it's more than essential tremor, and the symptoms don't appear to have any link to my emotional circumstances, so I don't believe it's an emotional disorder. I worry that there's some neurological damage going on.

My questions are: what pathways may be involved here, is there a name for this, and any good literature on Effexor-linked movement disorders - especially any connection to autism. Or tl;dr - is there any known remedy beyond lifelong palliative care?

"Hi all! Long time follower, first time poster.

39 year old female, overweight, PCOS, allergies, allergy induced asthma, very rare panic attacks. Also weird facial lesions/patches that randomly pop up and never leave.  

Medications: Hormonal IUD, Spironolactone, Effexor XR,  Zyzal, Vit D3, and montulkast. 

So I get these small red spots on my face randomly....usually when I'm under immense stress. They are either flat, smooth and red... Or red and scaly. And they only ever show up on my face... Nowhere else on my body. I've gone to a dermatologist for years for it, with no sort of resolution.  I've tried so many medications under the sun for it and have had so many tests.  Checked for autoimmune disorders, all cleared. Not lupus, not psoriasis, not rosecea, not acne, not eczema.  They don't come to terribly often, but they NEVER LEAVE.  First one noticed about 8-10 years ago maybe... Now have several.  My former dermatologist left the clinic I was at and I was her problem child!  Her best guess for it is Facial Discoid Dermatosis.   

Medications tried for it over the years in no particular order:
Trenton, 
Skin Medicinials combo ointment, 
Accutane, 
Eucrisa, 
Plaquenil, 
Zoryve, 
Calcipotriene and Betamethasone, 
Sulfa Antibiotic Face wash, 
Doxycycline, 
Fluconazole
..... I think that's most of them. 


I just did 10 weeks of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone with no change.  So my new dermatologist wants to try Stelara or Cosyntex. (I think it's those two she mentioned).  

To get on either of those, she wanted labs run.   So I happily obliged. 

She just called me today, saying everything looks fine. However, apparently I no longer have immunity to Hep B.  I just pulled up my medical records... I got the shot series back in like 2003.  And apparently 1 shot in 2019 and 1 shot in 2020. 

 How in the world do I lose my immunity to it if I've already had 1 or 2 extra shots?! 

Also if there are any dermatology pros here who could have any other suggestions for my face.... I'd greatly appreciate it!! 

The spots overall don't bother me. They don't itch, they don't hurt.  I just can't cover them up, make-up just makes them more noticeable and flaky.  However, I'm getting married in April... And would love for them to be gone, minimized, or at least not as noticeable!!

"Itchy spots on hands

27 year old, female, 155-160lbs, 5’3”
C/o multiple itchy bumps on hands that then peel the skin. 
Duration: 6+ months 
Everyday possible contributing factors: I’m an MA so computer, BP cuff squeezing (I work cards so all day), driving long distances for long periods of times consistently, using hand sanitizer, cervi wipes etc 

The spots begin feeling itchy and kind of like a blister then turns dry/white/hard/peels. 

 I’m going to attach photos in the comments. The L hand is the one that is the least problematic and really had just begun having a spot. My right hand which is my dominant hand is the main issue.

"TL;DR: neurological and musculoskeletal abnormalities issues x7 months with possible psych component, followed later by GI, GU, and respiratory symptoms

31M, 5'7"", 180 lbs, Caucasian. No alcohol, smoking or drugs. 

Initial s/s May 2019: dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, drowsiness (including falling asleep while driving), lethargy, worsening tremor, muscle spasms, BLE weakness, irregular gait, periods of confusion and forgetfulness, mild speech difficulties. At ER visit, MD noted nystagmus in one eye, no other assessment abnormalities. 

Progression: time from onset to disability = 3 weeks. Symptoms are ongoing and generally worsening, with no periods of remission

The following symptoms have appeared or gotten worse over 7 months: dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, lethargy, tremor, hallucinations (visible, audible, tactile), spasms, generalized weakness, migraines (in left side of head and being eyes), confusion, forgetfulness (esp short term memory loss), irregular gait and difficulty walking, multiple falls, speech and writing difficulties, frequent loose stools (later), worsening GERD with regurgitation and massively delayed gastric emptying > 12 hours (later), two short hypomanic episodes (2 and 3 days), tinnitus, bladder issues (incomplete or delayed emptying, having to try multiple times)

And pain: started after 3 weeks. Began in right knee, felt like both stabbing and pressure, worse with walking. No redness, swelling or signs of inflammation. Lasted a month, then was also in left knee. After a few weeks, it appeared in my right hip. Followed into my left hip, lower back, then shoulders and upper back, and finally my hands. Feels like it's in the muscles and tendons (for example, back pain is lateral). 

Improved or resolved: falling asleep spontaneously, tingling in soles of feet

Fluctuating in severity: ED, night terrors, occasional hand tingling

Current meds: lithium 300 mg BID, Seroquel 300 mg qHS, Effexor XR 150 mg at HS, 75 mg in AM, Mobic 15 mg daily, omeprazole 20 mg, Valium 1-2 mg PRN, ProAir PRN

Past adverse reactions: gabapentin (GI infections) and Reglan (suicidal ideation)

Past medical hx:

Surgeries: March 2019 vasectomy, 2017 appendectomy, 2009 jaw surgery

Dx: bipolar-2 disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, Tourette syndrome, OCD, IBS, GERD, asthma

Hx: hospitalized x4 with 10 rounds of ECT for bipolar depression about 5 years ago. Tremor has been present since lithium was started then, but was always minor. Lithium levels always WNL. All psych meds unchanged in 5 years. No history of psychosis; antipsychotics are for bipolar depression. 

Possible complication: I've had a series of bad experiences with patient deaths, and 2 weeks before symptoms onset, a patient that I had gotten close to passed away in an awful fashion, and I was very upset. My therapist indicated that she thinks I may have a form of PTSD. However, after his passing, I went on vacation and had a great time, and had not even been thinking about it when I returned to work. I only realized the possible connection months later. I also got out of an abusive marriage 2 years ago, which I am finally getting over. 

Other complication: Anxiety and depression have greatly increased, leading to a suicide attempt in July 2019, primarily d/t no diagnosis and being unable to work. 

Testing: the following tests were performed with no abnormalities: head CT and MRI without contrast, dozens of labs, CK, inflammatory markers, lithium level, Lyme test, ANA, EMG and NCS, EEG, neuropsych battery, XRs of cervical and lumbar spine, skin biopsy for small nerve fibers


Treatments: 

PCP: started on vit D and B12 for borderline levels, referred to specialists. 

Neurology: can't give dx d/t no positive tests. Says that symptoms match a small portion of multiple illnesses, but not one specifically. Says that it is not MS, ALS, fibromyalgia, hereditary ataxia. Referred to PT for pain and vertigo. 

Psychiatry: recommended stopping lithium and Seroquel, which had no effect after 1 week, so they were restarted. States that stress and anxiety explain some symptoms and make others worse, but doesn't explain a lot of other symptoms. States that illness is not psychiatric in nature, especially since meds have not changed in 5 years. 

Rheumatologist: it is not fibromyalgia of CFS, not rheumatological. 

Pain management: muscle and joint pain not made better with ice, heat, ibuprofen, Tylenol, meloxicam, tramadol, or creams. Better with rest and repositioning. Referred to pain program, did not want to prescribe muscle relaxer d/t fatigue, driving issues, and falls. Migraines improved with meloxicam and Ajovy; Ajovy was later stopped. 

Pain PT: no pain relief

Vertigo PT: no relief, stated that it did not seem to be an inner ear problem. Also noted pendular nystagmus on one visit. 


Currently:

Unable to work since late May. Attempted to go back in July but was unfit, also fell and injured shoulder, and was asked to leave. Unable to work other jobs d/t vertigo, pain, memory problems, and hallucinations. Able to perform limited amount of all ADLs. Meanwhile, I'm slowly losing my grip on reality d/t frustration with diagnosis and tx, memory loss, confusion, vertigo, and increasingly vivid hallucinations. The current plan is to just wait. ",1
"Hi doctors! I'm hoping to pick the brains of some of y'all who might have an idea on why my bone hasn't healed.
A little bit of history/background:
I had a bernese periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) and arthroscopy with labral repair done on 2/22/22 (lol). I've continued to have pain, and it's just manageable enough to walk short distances (no hiking w/o pain, cannot run, jump, etc.) I had a hip arthroscopy done in my right hip in July of 2022, which had me bearing weight on my left leg primarily for 6ish weeks and I definitely noticed my pain get worse in my left hip and it hasn't improved.
I had a PAO done on the right hip 06/09/20 that had total bone healing within 10 weeks, and I had those surgical screws removed later that year in November.

My PAO surgeon has been seeing me every 3ish months to do x-rays and check on bone growth, and it was evident that my ischial cut was not healing. I was prescribed a bone stimulator sometime in August or September and it did not appear to help. My surgeon ordered a CT scan on the 4th since I was still in significant pain and we found that there are actually two displaced non-unions: the ischial osteotomy (known) and the pubic root (did not notice this on an x-ray). The ischial osteotomy was originally made halfway through the bone in order to preserve the posterior column, but I apparently fractured all the way through it over the course of the last year. (https://imgur.com/a/jIFj0cb is my super simplified approximation of the fractures).

Long story short, I need to have both of these fractures grafted and plated. My surgeon rightfully wants to make sure he's eliminated any metabolic reason that my body refuses to build bone there before he goes in and attempts to fix the problem.

I am an almost 27yo non-smoking Caucasian woman, 5'2 and approx 125lbs. I am currently taking Effexor, Wellbutrin (started in December), levothyroxine, Xyxal, Adderal XR (started in December), Vitamin D supplement, Calcium supplement, and trazodone at night for sleep.
I do not have diabetes, and there is no infection in the hip. I work at as a case manager in the mental health field, so the majority of my day is spent sitting. The surgeon ordered the following labs that have all returned within normal ranges, though I will increase my vitamin D and calcium supplements to improve those levels some more.

- Tissue Transglutaminase AB, IGA 

- Phosphate

- Immunoglobulin A

- TSH Reflex Free T4

- PTH

- Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy
- C Reactive Protein
- ESR

I am doing a 3 day saliva cortisol test this weekend and will be returning those samples on Monday.
This is where my question comes in. Do you know of any other reason why my fractures haven't healed so far? I'm nervous to undergo a 5th surgery in less than 3 years in case it doesn't fix the problem. I'm happy to provide any additional information that I have, but I'm generally just curious and anxious to know what the plan is moving forward. I'm getting married in May, so this is horrendous timing lol.",1

My medical history is long so the short of it is I have had my gall bladder,  spleen, 90% of my pancreas, 1 ovary, both fallopian tubes, cervox, uterus, and part of my lymph nodes removed due to a tumor bigger than a golf ball in my pancreas, a tubial pregnancy, endometriosis, gall stones, two pulmonary embolisms, 4 blood transfusions, iron transfusions and other issues steming from the essential thrombocytosis. 

So I have been on Hydrea for a year. It is likely I will be on it for the rest of my life sue to having a hemmoragic myeloproliferative neoplasm. 

My question is this, is it possible to be slowly poisoning my husband through sexual contact?

 There is a warning I have pasted below from u of m health that warns on cleaning up urine or bodily fluids but it never mentions concerns with sexual contact. It did say to use birth control to avoid pregnancy so that you don't have birth defects in children. Exposure to this drug has been shown to cause leukemia.

I have had chronically low iron for the past 10 years (results below).  I get tested, put on iron supplements, develop horrible heart palpitations and fatigue, stop taking them and start feeling better. This cycle repeats literally every few years. I mention it to every doctor but they never really give me an answer, and I always start doubting how bad it makes me feel so I take the supplements again and it starts all over. 

I have a strong family history of heart disease: Maternal grandfather had polycythemia vera, 3 heart attacks, and multiple bypass surgeries (3 I think); my mom had a stent at 56 and triple bypass at 62, oldest maternal uncle has polycythemia vera and quadruple bypass at 41, another maternal uncle had quadruple bypass at 40, another maternal uncle a heart attack at 56. None of them are overweight, non-smokers, and don't drink alcohol. I have mitral valve prolapse and high cholesterol (~320), had a clear stress test in 2009 and my last EKG was last week which was normal.

Please help me understand why I feel so terrible when I take supplements and/or my iron levels are close to normal. When I'm taking the supplements I get terrible palpitations after eating any meal, regardless of fat/carb/salt content. I feel like my heart is pounding out of my chest and I get so extraordinarily fatigued I fall asleep after every single meal. I end up losing weight because I stop eating. So inevitably I stop the supplements and everything returns to normal until the next time a doctor checks my iron. This occurs with OTC and prescription iron supplements. Everyone tells me how great I'll feel when my iron levels are normal but I feel terrible instead. THANK YOU!

"I'm gonna try to be quick as I don't want to bore anyone. Here's my medical history (psychiatric side only):

* Developed a few tics during my childhood, which pretty much disappeared during my teenage years.
* Always anxious at school, from my very first year (age 5).
* At the age of 11, I developed what I think was my first compulsion. I developed a fear of being late for school, and as a result, before going to bed, I would repeatedly push the toggle switch on my alarm clock (switch that would enable the alarm) to make sure that I would wake up on time. I would push the switch 5 times, do another set of 5, another set of 5, until it felt ""done"". After some time tossing in my bed I would again check my alarm clock and incessantly push the toggle switch, until my thumb hurt.
* At the age of 13 is when I developed full blown OCD, constantly checking everything and never being sure that what is done is truly done. My hands constantly felt oily and I would wash them dozens of times every day. They bled during winter because of that.
* At the age of 15, my social anxiety became much worse, I had pain in my stomach constantly except during the weekend. I started to really fear school.
* Still at the age of 15, but a bit later, I developed depression. Nothing felt pleasurable, I was sad all the time, I constantly fantasized about hanging myself in a park, and wondered what my close relatives would think when they would hear about my death.
* Age 16, depression vanished but social anxiety and OCD still present. Properly diagnosed by a psychiatrist now.
* Age 17, dropped out of school because the social anxiety is too much to bear.
* Age 18-25, slowly developing hypersomnia, sleeping 16 hours a day at the age of 25.
* Age 25, doctor says the hypersomnia is caused by my anxiety rather than being a sleep disorder by itself. Zoloft was initiated at 25 mg and slowly titrated to 200 mg.

The first side effect I noticed from zoloft is insomnia. I would sleep for no more than 3 hours in a row, and I would stay awake for only a few hours until I needed to take a nap. My sleep became extremely fragmented. I developed fatigue, loss of joy, loss of motivation, felt like a complete vegetable. It was unclear at that time if those were a direct result of the medication or rather a result of the insomnia caused by the medication.

I switched from zoloft 200 mg to effexor xr 150 mg, and my insomnia and fatigue improved a bit. Effexor was titrated to 225 mg and that also improved my fatigue, but not much. I have done 3 sleep studies and they all came back ""negative"", though I never slept well during any of them, I wouldn't say those nights were representative of how I sleep at home.

I was referred to a psychiatrist for my ""residual symptoms"". Psychiatrist suggested to up the effexor to 300 mg, which completely abolished my fatigue for a whole 3 days. Didn't last long.

Not so long ago I was prescribed trazodone, which I had also been prescribed in the past but had quickly dismissed. Well, I'm happy to say that the trazodone does take care of my insomnia, and that getting rid of my insomnia does get rid of my fatigue. However, I still feel different to how I felt before the antidepressants, and the way I would describe it is that I am now emotionally flat, I can no longer feel the full spectrum of feelings I could feel before. Not only that, but the things I used to enjoy doing before, such as programming, browsing reddit, watching porn, online shopping, etc., no longer feel pleasurable. Now I still lay in bed all day, not because I'm tired, but because I don't feel like doing anything, nothing is fun. When I start doing anything that requires a bit of concentrating (say, programming), my mind gives up. Such cognitive dulling I have felt since the start, however it is not helped by trazodone.

I used to be full of energy, and motivation, though my social anxiety stopped me from accomplishing some of my goals. Now my anxiety is pretty good, but I have no energy and no motivation. I am not sure if this is worth it. I have tried to get rid of those symptoms with adjunct medications, but everything has pretty much failed so far. Here's a list:

Concerta: felt better for a few days, but quickly lost effectiveness. Didn't see a difference when I stopped taking it, except for the side effects going away.

Strattera: worsened my insomnia, felt more awake but only during the first few days. Developed excessive sweating, which I also got with concerta. Overall not effective.

Risperidone: this one I bought from the black market instead of being prescribed by my doctor, and is pretty much the best thing I've tried so far. Gets rid of my insomnia better than trazodone, makes me feel more awake even though I take it before going to sleep. No more anhedonia but still a bit of emotional numbing. Doctor doesn't want to prescribe it to me because of metabolic problems it can cause, such as diabetes, elevated triglycerides, etc. Gained a bit of weight with it but other than that it was pretty good.

Abilify: this one was prescribed to me from my doctor, because supposedly it is devoid of metabolic side effects. Well, I felt better when starting at 2 mg, but just like every other option I tried, it sort of went down a little bit and now I'm not sure I'm noticing any difference. Now at 4 mg, couldn't see any difference going from 2 mg to 4 mg. Risperidone was much better.

I bought some wellbutrin and modafinil online, still waiting for them to arrive.

"Going into this I want to mention - *I am on an alt account*, I moderate many large communities and I have a fear of people knowing what I go through. I am however going to be extremely open about this as I feel like this is my last chance to reach out.

Non smoker, no drugs (other than what is mentioned below) I do not drink alcohol and absolutely no caffeine and little sugar. 

My previous medical history includes anorexia(at 14 yrs old), 70 lbs admitted to the hospital and I had a week to live, my heart and bones ""ate themselves"" to stay alive so I had pretty bad damage to my heart and bones, once I was let go from the hospital I was never followed up on.

Other DIAGNOSED illness' I have: Borderline Personality Disorder, Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and a Dissociative Disorder. Half way through this whole thing I developed Health Anxiety. In 2016 I was kidnapped and raped for 2 months. I was checked for sexually transmitted diseases and all came back luckily NEGATIVE. I was extremely abused (cult like sexual abuse) as a child, so I have severe trauma from this.

I take Clonazepam 0.5 MG at night and have been taking it since August 2017 (looking to taper off this in April after speaking with my psychiatrist) as well as 5 MG of Melatonin and I have been taking this for at least 6 years.

Before all of this started I have had an ongoing ear infection that started in 2016 and still have it as posting.

When this all started I was 170 lbs, but due to this illness I have lost 60 or so lbs.

&#x200B;

I am a 20 year old Caucasian female, 5'3"", 112 lbs. This problem started in May of 2017 and it started randomly as Tachycardia. I had been smoking Medical Marijuana at the time for 3 months prior to this, unsure if it has anything to do with it but I decided I might as well throw it in there. (Note: I stopped Marijuana the night this started) The night it all started I went to the doctor, my BPM was 130 and I was sent home with ""possible anxiety"" and Tachycardia. I have Borderline Personality Disorder so this isn't off the table. I figured that was normal, I took an ativan and I went home. The heart racing went on for about 2 days before I decided it probably wasn't a panic attack and I went back to the doctor. Yet again they didn't see anything so they sent me home. From there it only got worse, I began to experience pain all over my body and I was unable to leave bed without it becoming hard to breathe. It was like this for around a month or so and I was in and out of the hospital quite a few times in those months. Eventually they put me on Effexor XR figuring it was really bad anxiety and the side effects were so horrible they took me off of it and the withdrawal was so bad I tried to take my life by hanging myself. I was found and was admitted to the hospital with no damage. I went home and continued staying in bed, throughout the summer I was on antibiotics on and off for random infections I would get. I had a UTI, then a yeast infection, then a UTI again etc. It was day in and out something new all the time. Around September I decided to try to get out of bed, I had been meditating a lot more and I felt like I could finally do something. I got out of bed but even sitting up would make my heart race to 100 BPM. I couldn't laugh with my friends or play games as my heart would race even more and I would feel ill. This is around when my leg problem started. Randomly I got a problem that when I stood up [my legs would swell within 5 minutes of standing](https://imgur.com/a/RurkwMF). I can only akin the pain to when you have a blood pressure cuff on and it feels like your hand is going to explode from the blood being stuck in your hand(?). Either way after this I was sent to an internal medicine specialist where I asked ""could this be Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome?"" because he really had no idea. The reason I asked this was because when I looked for images like my legs I found a blog with pictures like my legs. I also have the whole heart-rate jump when standing. My heart goes from 49-57 BPM when resting to 120 BPM just upon standing, not walking or anything just standing. Regardless the doctor was completely stumped and told me to try a POTS diet with high salt and lots of water. I did so for a few months and it did nothing. I've been tested and all my blood work seemingly comes back ok, my thyroid seems fine, my magnesium all that etc... This ""illness"" causes pain EVERYWHERE sometimes I can't even get out of bed. I don't know if this has anything to do with it but I also have a LOT of odd discharge, grainy and even stringy sometimes. Whenever I am checked for it however the doctors say they can't find anything. I have tinea versicolor that comes and goes every once and awhile. Just throwing things out there that might be useful.

Things I've thought it could be are Lupus (was checked, came back negative), A heart issue (thanks to my anorexia in the past), POTS? I'm lost.

Any help with this would be appreciated, this illness has ruined my life and I feel like I've taken a lot of things for granted before this illness started.

If you have any questions I am happy to answer them + edit my post. Thank you so much.",1

If I can provide anything else, please let me know.  I am going out of my mind with the insomnia and night sweating.  I've had various doctors over my lifetime suspect I have a thyroid disorder but when they look at my TSH results they always say it is normal.  I really don't care if it is a thyroid disorder or not, I just want to get better.  My symptoms have been getting worse over time and I feel like this is my breaking point.",1

The last 4 months I've been having strange dizzy spells weird part is they happen when I'm already standing walking or sometimes when I'm just sitting on the couch or a chair. They vary in severity but they are always accompanied by nausea and the feeling I need to lay down. There have been 2 times now that it was so bad that I actully blacked out ( I think  , I've never blacked out before but it felt like the hole room was spinning my vision becomes blurry and there was a loud ringing in my ears) I started to feel it happening and I started to lay down and on my way down all of a sudden I could not hear anything or see and I was on the ground and I had to just lay there on the kitchen floor feeling extremely sick. My bf helped me get to couch and I just had to lay there until it passed. That happened twice now but there have been multiple times that I could feel the same feeling dizziness nausea no blacking out or what ever that was but I have to lay down and if I walk around or anything it makes it way worse. 

I'm sorry if that isn't a good explanation but I'm really confused as to what is happened.

Edit spelling",1
"I have pain in my right hip/lower back, as well as my left foot and calf.  They present differently, and I'll go into details below, but basically wondering what type of doctor/specialist I should seek out--orthopedist, physical therapist, or podiatrist (or other I'm not even thinking of).

33F, 5'6"", 210 lbs. Meds: Effexor (225mg xr) and Wellbutrin(150mg xr) for anxiety/depression, Adderall (20mg xr) for adhd, multivitamin, and got my first covid shot on Monday (Pfizer).  Don't smoke cigarettes, never have. Drink socially (2-4 drinks,  3-4 times a month). Smoke weed like once a year.  No other drugs. 

Summer 2012.  After switching antidepressants, I gained about 50 pounds in a little over a year. To help me lose wait, I started walking around my hilly neighborhood. My feet and calves would hurt quite badly, especially when walking uphill. Not normal I'm-quite-out-of-shape pain, but sharp this-isn't-right pain.  I began wearing shoes with supportive arches, which helped immensely in everyday walking, or walking distances on flat ground, but walking uphill can still be painful even today.  It also hurts if I try to run. While I'm not in shape, I usually have to stop running not from being out of breath, but from foot/calf pain.  I adjusted by making my forms of exercise flat walking or using an elliptical. 

Summer/fall 2018.  I was at the heaviest of my adult life (240 lbs), and finally got to the point of making some major lifestyle changes. Over about 6 months I lost 30 lbs, then lost another 20 in the next 6.  However, this is when (\~ 30 lbs) I started to notice pain in my hip/lower back. (I think it's mostly my gluteus medius?)  I'm unsure if it's from increased walking and exercise (mostly elliptical), or using muscles differently than when I was heavier, or just coincidental timing.  I ended up at PT for the hip/back pain. Between the prescribed exercise/stretches and electronic needling (I can't quite remember what it's actually called), my symptoms improved, and I stopped PT.  

April 2020.  I'm standing in the kitchen, and my boyfriend walks upstairs. Where I'm standing in the kitchen in relation to the stairs, he's walking straight at me.  It's early covid quarantine, and I'm wearing just leggings and a t-shirt that is normally too short to wear with leggings, which made my posture/stance very obvious.  He's taken aback, and tells me how crooked I'm standing, with my right hip jutting out. Here is me from the [back](https://imgur.com/a/DpE0M2e), and me from the [front](https://imgur.com/a/JNWsYZz).  It's perhaps most noticeable [when I mirror each side separately](https://imgur.com/undefined). He helped me to correct my posture, and if I consciously thought of it, I could usually correct myself. Though it hurt my hip to stand correctly, and sometimes felt i was overcorrecting, though boyfriend said I wasn't overcorrecting, it just felt off because I'm always so crooked. 

June 2020.  After 2.5 months of staying inside, we're finally walking local trails after work.  My feet and calves are hurting me a lot, even though the trail is mostly flat with small minor hills.  One day when we get home, I'm walking upstairs ahead of boyfriend, and he notices my [left foot](https://imgur.com/a/Rom2MyE) and takes a picture.  I'd been wearing old, non-athletic shoes since we're walking on sometimes muddy trails, and apparently the total lack of arch support is not good for me.  After that point I switched to running shoes with arch support, and consciously had to retrain myself to walk on the outside of my feet, but it helped about 80% of the pain problem. 

 January 2021 - today. I pulled muscles in my lower back from lifting a heavy object incorrectly. This was *not* the muscles causing me pain above.  It was an unrelated, acute instance.  I recovered from the pulled back over the next week+, but in the meantime some of what I was compensating for led my previous hip/back pain return. And return it did.  It's way worse than it ever was.  Depending on the day, walking more than a half mile to mile, will cause pain for the rest of the day.  I can't walk and turn my head to look at something without sharp immediate pain.  Going from Standing to sitting is painful.  We did a bunch of yardwork Saturday, which was manageable for me, but the next day my hip/back was terrible. 

Since realizing how crooked I stand, and reading up online, I've come to realize my foot/calf pain and hip/back pain may be very much related.  Of the things I've read, [lateral pelvic tilt](https://posturedirect.com/lateral-pelvic-tilt/) and [functional leg length discrepancy](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Leg_Length_Discrepancy) sound very spot on to my symptoms.  One thing I didn't mention previously, and I assumed was unrelated to this, is mild pain in my mid-left back when I'm doing dishes, or bending over a counter for an extended period. Apparently QL pain opposite the side wit the high hip is common. 

Today, I returned to PT.  I'm seeing a different PT as my old one left the office.  I'm worried that his job is to treat the symptoms, the immediate pain in my hip/back, without addressing the cause.  I brought up my foot/calf issues, but because it's not evident when I'm just standing for a short while, I'm not sure if he believed me, or is taking it into account as much as he should.  He did quickly check the length of my legs when I was lying on the table, and he said they seem to be the same length.  But I think it's functional, not anatomic.  My (non-clinical/medical) boyfriend insists I need to see an orthopedist, since a PT will just address the symptoms/pain, without taking everything into account.  I don't want to do a minimum of 8 more sessions of PT at $30/copay if it will not address everything.  

Is PT right for me?  Will an ortho want me to do PT first anyway?  Will an ortho address non-surgical needs?  Who should I see?",1
"I am 19FM, 5’2, 115lbs, white, was taking nortriptyline for 1 week but doctors just switched me to Effexor XR and I’m picking it up today. I do not smoke or so drugs. I have had alcohol 9 times in my life but not recently. 

Hi, I’m Lizzy. I am 19 and in college (CT) and I have these random spells where I feel pressure in the back of my head for a second, and immediately after my vision doubles (vertically, one clock on top of another clock) and the left side of my body tingles and feels numb down to my leg. When it happens it almost feels like my head is vibrating. After the spells the back left of my head kind of feels like it’s burning. These spells have been going on for 18 days. Most times they come randomly, but I notice things like bending, over exerting myself, and movement can trigger them. My double vision lasts the longest, even after I get feeling back on my left side. When they happen, my heart usually races (I try to tell myself to be calm, but I think it’s my bodies reaction to freak out) but lately, it feels almost like my heart stops when I feel the pressure in my head, and then starts beating again when my vision doubles. The spells usually only last about a minute, and when they come they come in clusters. Each day this goes on for the spells are more frequent and last longer. I am exhausted. I can not do daily things. They come when I’m in bed, in the shower, walking to class. All my schoolwork got pushed back thankfully but I feel like my life is on hold and I am scared. I want my life back. I want to be able to not be scared to get up every morning because of this. I went to the ER and they gave me a migraine cocktail IV (thought these symptoms were some wack migraine) and it didn’t work. I had a follow up with the neurologist I saw at the ER yesterday and he said he’s not even sure it’s a migraine because of how frequently the spells happen. They are running scans but told me they think it could be anxiety. Trust me guys, I know anxiety, and these symptoms GIVE ME ANXIETY but I was living a stress free happy college life after the summer of my dreams, and these spells occur due to over exertion and randomly, EVEN WHEN IM PEACEFUL and health services at uconn is fighting for me and they kinda are sensing migraine but they understand that these symptoms are debilitating and are not “panic attacks”. Please help. I don’t care what this is (even if it is anxiety but trust me, it’s not, I literally am having stroke like symptoms even when i feel the safest and am doing daily things like brushing my teeth) the diagnosis does not matter, regardless I am having these life altering symptoms and I am in need of relief. I need a neurologist that won’t give up on me. Currently Yale is trying to get me an early appointment but for the time being I don’t know what to do!!! I’m still at college because I can not drive in this condition and if I went home I’d be cooped up in my house all day alone, but I’m all college and I can’t even do school work because the spells are so frequent and disabling. I need my brain to go back to normal ASAP. I’m scared, exhausted and at my breaking point. What do I do? I have nothing better to do all day than call doctors. I want my life back. Since all of this started, I stopped taking my birth control because i had been off and on with it, and had started it up again two days before my symptoms started. I thought maybe it was a trigger. Since stopping, my chin acne has gotten worse. That is the least of my concerns right now.  Please help!",1
"32F, 5'3'', 180lbs, Caucasian, excessive facial/scalp sweating for a number of years - I can't really remember. I have a history of severe depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. I've had borderline high blood pressure, but my GP said not enough to take meds for it - we just keep an eye on it. I've been taking 300mg of Effexor XR daily, for a long time - years. After trial & error with different meds with my psychiatrist, this was the med, and the dose, that seemed to work for me. For the most part, my mental health is well-maintained. I also take Vitamin C (500mg 2x/day), Calcium (500mg 2x/day), and Vitamin D (1000 IU/day). Right now I am also taking Aspirin and Tylenol for post-operative pain/healing (I had orthopaedic surgery on May 12). I drink regularly, but don't smoke or do drugs.

I'm at my rope's end with my excessive facial/scalp sweating. It is an issue in every aspect of my life. And wearing a mask is NOT helping!

\- At work, with the AC on, I still need my desk fan on. I'm known as the ""sweater"", and who wants to be known as that?

\- I can't walk short distances, even in cool weather, without breaking into a sweat.

\- People stare at me on the bus because I'm sweating so much. By the time I get to work, I've sweated my make-up off. My boss once asked me if it was raining, because my hair was wet - it was not raining.

\- I'm known for carrying around, and using, a hand fan at all times.

\- I avoid social situations and activities because of it; even just buying something from a store can be humiliating, and makes me act incredibly awkward and rush through the transaction.

\- I don't date, largely because of my sweating - I completely lack confidence.

\- Every summer, I want to go out and have fun, but I don't, because of the sweating.

\- I'm somewhat plump as it is, so this just makes me feel gross and fat. When I've lost weight I've seen no decrease in the sweating, however.

I figured that this was just my lot in life, an unlucky genetic lottery, but a chance Googling of hyperhidrosis revealed that excessive sweating may be a side-effect of Effexor. This could be a game-changer for me. As effective as Effexor is for me, I 100% would stop using it, to see if my sweating improves. It's really affecting my quality of life.

I'm curious to know if there are any doctors on here who have come across this before, for patients on Effexor, and/or any general recommendations or thoughts you may have. I plan to make an appointment with my GP on Monday, but this weekend discovery was just too exciting for me apparently, and I thought I would post here too. Thank you so much for reading!

\-

UPDATE: My GP prescribed me Aventyl (nortriptyline) which I have been taking (10 mg) for about 3 weeks now. I already see a difference! There is still some sweating, and I was told I could go up to 20mg, if, after a few weeks, the issue was still there. I may try 20mg next week. But I'm really pleased so far with the results - it is such a relief. Even if it's just placebo effect. ;)",1

Primary Complaints/Issues:

-Finding words

-Using the right tone of voice, sometimes it’s like I can’t hear/tell what tone of voice I’m using. 

-Difficulty putting my thoughts into words. It’s easier when I am writing or typing, but even when typing it takes me a while. I’ve had issues with this since childhood, but I’ve only just now realized it.

-Difficultly knowing what things I am supposed to say/ need to say out loud/tell other people. For example, telling my mom that I was having severe back pain when I was a child. I never told her other than saying “my back hurts”, I didn’t say “it really hurts and it makes it hard to run or walk sometimes” and when the doctor told me it was just growing pains I didn’t mention it again even it when it still kept hurting. Or not knowing to tell her that I had holes in my socks and needed new ones. I still have issues with this, I’m not sure if this is an issue with communication or something else.

-Remembering to do things. Like remembering to do my laundry, take a shower, go eat, scheduling appointments, etc. I will see a stack of laundry or think about appointments I need to make and then make a mental note that I need to do that and then I never remember it again till weeks later. It’s not that I’m procrastinating and putting it off or being lazy, it’s that I genuinely don’t remember. If I write it down in a notebook or on a sticky note I end up either losing the notebook or note or I don’t remember to look at it and then end up finding it a month later. The same thing happens when I write out plans for things. 

-Coordination issues, tripping over my own feet, randomly losing my balance while standing, I wobble if I stand with my eyes closed. I’ve been dropping things a lot lately also, I’ll be holding a cup and I’m the middle of bringing it to my mouth my fingers just completely let go on their own. It’s been happening for the past 5 years but it’s been getting worse gradually.

-Severe Fatigue. I can only do a seated activity for an hour or two before I have to lay down and rest. This applies to physical or mental activities. Like if I sweep the floor I have to do it sitting in a chair, and sweeping a room takes me at least an hour because I do things very slowly. I am very thorough about it at least. But after I do that I have to lay down for the rest of the day. Mental activities are slow too, and I will have to rest after typing all of this out. I’ve probably spent an hour typing and rewording everything so far so that it makes sense.
 What I mean by “I get tired”, all the symptoms I mentioned before get worse. I can barely speak, can’t find my words, lose my coordination and balance, I feel confused, my head gets warm to the touch, my face looks and feels flushed, and my mom says it seems like I’m having a stroke except without the slurring and face drooping. 

-Seizure like tremors: after a couple of weeks where I took the advice of well meaning friends and family and “pushed through it”, I started having tics/tremors. They start as what I found out are called “internal tremors”, where I can feel them starting. If I don’t rest immediately when I start to feel these, I start twitching on the outside. It’s like a ripple of twitches that starts from my face and goes down my arms and torso like wave almost. They start out smaller and are more like tics. I get a little disoriented when it happens. Sometimes if I rest at this point they will go away on their own and I have to stay in bed and rest for a few weeks so they won’t come back. But a couple of times they continued to get worse, which is when my mom took me to the ER. It turned into full body writhing, my face kept scrunching and twisting and my mom told me later it looked like something between a sezuire and someone who had cerebral palsy. I was still able to talk some during it, and was semi conscious/in and out of consciousness. It went on for 8 hours, until I finally fell asleep. The on call Neurologist showed up after 12 hours, by which it had stopped. They did an MRI, which we never got the results from, and he told me it was “emotional tics” and sent me home. 
 They started up again mildly when I got home, mom took me to a different ER, they kept me for two days, did an EEG and MRI, which again they didn’t give us results from/didn’t give us copies of, but they said they couldn’t find anything and sent me home.


 I followed up with a neurologist and they did a sleep test and found I have sleep apnea. They also did another overnight sleep test and an MSLT to rule out narcolepsy and those were normal. 
He wanted me to use my cpap machine for 6 months and then follow up and see if my fatigue and weird tremor/shaking episodes went away. 
 I followed up with him after the 6 months and I’m still having the same issues, and he wants me to come off of both my Effexor and my Adderall completely and then do another sleep test because he said they recorded no REM sleep on either of my sleep tests. I wasn’t able to sleep well at the sleep center because of my anxiety and I think that why I slept poorly.
 I have slowly over the past 4 months lowered my Effexor ER from 225mg down to 150mg. I am starting to feel like a living piece of crap from my depression. I don’t feel like I can safely go any lower on my medication without becoming suicidal. 
 Ive asked this neurologist if we could look into if maybe this could be caused by something other than sleep, since my symptoms keep getting worse unless I keep myself basically home bound/bed bound, which I have been other than doctor’s appointments. He told me he’s a neurologist that only specializes in sleep. He said he’s trying to get me off of all my medicine because they interfere with REM sleep and he wants to check if that’s what’s causing it.

 I’ve had bloodwork done and it came back normal. I’ve had a thyroid panel done several times, all of them were normal. I’ve had a couple other blood tests done but I can’t remember what they are. My mom keeps copies of everything so I can ask her to help me find those or other things if I need to. 
I had an MRI done a year or two ago and it said it was normal except some kind of scarring that they blamed on migraines even though I rarely have migraines (I have maybe one every 4 months I think?). We don’t have the cd, just the report. If we want to get the MRI and EEG from when I was in the hospital we would have to go in person to the hospital and I have to sign a release form or something. 

 Should I just continue to go off of my medicine and get the sleep test done like the sleep neurologist wants to do? Or should I ask for a different neurologist? Is there other things that I should be checked for? 
 The only thing I could find that sounded kind of similar to what I’ve been experiencing is CFS, but I am not sure that the shaking/tremor attack things fit that, and not being able to think well makes it hard to figure out what tests to have done and what doctors I should be asking. 
 My mom has been having issues with thinking/dementia-like symptoms going on lately too, and she’s the only family that’s able to help me right now, so any help is appreciated.
 I’m sorry that this is a giant wall of text. I spent two hours writing it. I am exhausted. Thank you so much to anyone who even just reads through this whole thing, even if you can’t help, I appreciate you taking the time to read it.

Edit: Im on mobile. This post was more organized when I typed it in my notes app on my phone but when I copied and pasted it on here it turned into a jumbled mess. I’m too exhausted to try and fix it, I’m really sorry.",1
"**Age:** 24  
**Sex:** Female  
**Height:** 5'6""  
**Weight:** 194lbs  
**Race:** Hispanic  
**Duration of complaint:** A little over 2 weeks depending on medication adherence.  
**Any existing relevant medical issues (if any):** Asthma, ADHD, Major Depressive Disorder (recurring), PTSD, GAD.   
**Current medications (if any):** Vyvanse 70mg, Zoloft 50mg, Vistaril 50mg PRN for anxiety/sleep, 25mg Meclizine PRN for dizziness, 25mg Phenergan PRN for nausea, Zyrtec 10mg, Breo inhaler 100/25 mcg, Proair HFA 90mcg inhaler, nexplanon birth control implant, Vitamin D2 50,000 unit capsule 1x weekly.   


A couple weeks ago I checked myself into a behavioral health hospital because I had a breakdown after shitty gen chem lab experience at school, prompted by me feeling like my ADHD meds weren't working, in addition to dizziness prior to lab and hand tremors during lab (typically only get the hand tremors when I take the rescue inhaler, but I didn't need to take it before lab). Back in december my psychiatrist and I agreed that my depression relapsed, so I got back onto 25mg of Pristiq to start out with, but this time I got to a point of suicidal ideations with a plan, so I didn't feel safe waiting until my next psychiatry appointment to up the dose or change medications. I was at the hospital for 8 days.  


At the hospital they switched me to 75mg of Effexor from Pristiq, and had 100mg of Vistaril PRN for sleep or anxiety for every patient. I took it most nights I was there because I was desperate for sleep and it helped a little with falling asleep, just not at all for staying asleep (tossed and turned worse than I ever have). My inhalers were swapped for some blue inhaler instead of my red rescue inhaler, and advair 1x a day (it was prescribed 2x per day but I opted to only take it at night because that's what I was used to with the breo and no one explained to me why they prescribed it 2x instead 1x). I only felt like I had to use the rescue inhaler a couple times during the 8 days at the hospital.  


About an hour and a half or 2 hours after I had taken my morning meds on my 2nd day of the Effexor XR, I started getting really disconcerting physical symptoms with a sudden onset. It started feeling like I was on the verge of passing out, my heart was pounding, it felt a little hard to breathe, dull stomach pain with and without nausea, I was super lightheaded/dizzy, and no amount of deep breathing and laying down in a quiet room would help me get my heart rate to come down. Sometimes I'd get sharp headaches and chest pains in addition to everything else, as well as a flutter feeling in my chest (or best I can describe it as is the feeling you get when your muscle twitches, except in my chest). 

&#x200B;

After being home and still having these issues with more consistent chest pain and our PA also pushing anxiety for the most part, I've been looking at the info sheets for my meds. The Zoloft, Breo, Proair, and Vistaril all have a warning about QT prolongation. I haven't taken the Vistaril since being at the hospital, and the symptoms have been a little less intense. The PA suggested stopping the vyvanse. After 3 days of that there was a small improvement in that the symptoms didn't hit me like a truck when they would start. I stopped taking my inhalers just to see what would happen (too scared to gamble stopping the zoloft) and there was a lot more improvement in symptoms throughout the day. The only day I've had zero symptoms was when I had a mid-morning abdominal ultrasound to check my gallbladder and couldn't eat or drink anything for 8 hours prior, and since I was feeling significantly better physically I just didn't take anything for the rest of the day to see if the symptoms would come back at any point. I felt completely fine for the rest of the day until a headache and some nausea at bed time.   


I have an EKG scheduled for later this week to follow up on an ""abnormal"" EKG from summer 2017 that I never ended up following up on because we were moving at the time that had notes saying ""Sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, possible left atrial enlargement \[-0.1mV P wave in v1/v2\], marked right axis deviation \[QRS axis > 100\], abnormal ECG"". 

I got that EKG after having chest pains and trouble breathing. Sometime prior to that I had a much more intense and terrifying, but similar episode to what's going on now where I did pass out momentarily after taking my breo inhaler, fluconazole, and mirtazapine at the same time in the evening and Adderall ER and Pristiq earlier that morning. The urgent care I went to for that said it was ""probably serotonin syndrome"" from the antidepressants and that it couldn't be the fluconazole despite it being the only new medication I took that night, and then they sent me home.   


**Since trying to read up on QT prolongation, I do see it's rare to have it without fainting. The PA hasn't expressed any worry about any of my medication except for my Vyvanse. I still don't feel like it's all anxiety. Is it worth asking the PA about the possibility of drug induced QT prolongation?**",1
"Looking for advice on taking oral MAOI(selegiline or other) for depression.

Demographic info: I am a Caucasian female, 29 years old, 5'8.5'', currently about 125 pounds (but my weight fluctuates a lot with my depression and anxiety, from about 110 pounds to 155 pounds; my weight gain or loss is never intentional, and I don't have an eating disorder or anything along those lines). I'm a nonsmoker. My mental health issues ""feel"" very biological, and I have no history of trauma or abuse. I have a pretty good life, but it doesn't feel that way.

Current medical issues: severe treatment-resistant depression, ADHD (inattentive only, non hyperactive, diagnosed in adulthood), generalized anxiety. Chronic fatigue (though no official diagnosis of CFS or anything) and feeling very groggy regardless of how much sleep I get.

Past medical issues: I've always been pretty physically healthy, or so they tell me. Sometimes nausea and low appetite; I've been underweight before because of appetite and nausea, likely mental health related.

Current medications: Desvenlafaxine ER  100mg (generic pristiq), generic adderall XR (20mg), and generic adderall IR (10 mg twice per day). 

Past meds:
-Antidepressants: venlafaxine, Viibryd, bupropion, Prozac, zoloft, Lexapro, nortripytilene, and emsam patch.
-Also tried both TMS and ECT.
-for anxiety: Xanax, klonopin, gabapentin, propranolol
-ADHD: Vyvanse, Ritalin, dexedrine 
-Other: abilify, latuda, seroquel
Main side effects of SSRI/SNRI have been sedation (which is really bad for me since I'm already groggy all the time) with little to no actual efficacy in reducing depression symptoms and reduced efficacy over time. Exceptions: Viibryd caused nausea and vomiting, and Effexor caused lightheadedness. Wellbutrin may have helped a little bit with depression for awhile but worsened my anxiety. Emsam worked best by far and helped my depression and fatigue (I had some insomnia but it was totally worth it), but the response still felt sort of suboptimal. Maybe it just needed some augmentation with something else.

I took the GeneSight test which came back as follows:
-ultrarapid metabolizer of cyp2d6 and ugt1a4. Intermediate metabolizer of cyp3a4. All other pharmacogenetic genes tested were normal.
-SLC6A4, serotonin transporter gene, heterozygous (L/S)
-ADRA2A gene, C/C (""this genotype suggests a reduced response to certain ADHD medications"")
-COMT: VAL/MET heterozygous
-MTHFR: heterozygous for C677T polymorphism 

---------
I have severe, treatment resistant depression. I was first diagnosed when I was 14 (I'm almost 30 now). Also ADHD and anxiety. I am an ultrarapid metabolizer of cyp2d6.

I've tried so many different medications over the years. I even tried ECT. And TMS. 

The only thing that has ever really helped was Emsam (selegiline transdermal); I wish the psychiatrists had recommended trying this before doing ECT. Emsam was the first thing that also took away the feeling of being super groggy all the time. I have low response to stimulants; coffee and energy drinks do literally nothing, and even adderall has just a small effect.

I am looking for advice on oral selegiline. The transdermal one is supposed to be better (better-tolerated at least with fewer dietary restrictions), but there's no generic version and I can't afford it.

Quick rant about our fucked up healthcare system (USA). I had Medicaid when I wasn't working. Now that I'm working, I no longer qualify. I can't afford Obamacare (I'm low income and the cheapest option is over $400 per month). I don't get health insurance through work either. Even though I do work 35+ hours per week, the hours aren't guaranteed. The company policy is that you have to work there for a year, then they look back and see if you've worked at least 30 hrs per week on average. If so, then you qualify for benefits.

It all feels so fucked up. Anyway, any advice is really, really appreciated. Thank you!",1
"TL;DR: neurological and musculoskeletal abnormalities for 12 months; widespread muscle pain and weakness, dysfunctional bladder, and now aspiration


31M, 5'7"", 180 lbs, Caucasian. No alcohol, smoking or drugs.


Initial s/s May 2019: dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, drowsiness (including falling asleep while driving), lethargy, right knee pain, BLE weakness, irregular gait and difficulty walking, occasional muscle spasms, periods of confusion and forgetfulness, mild speech difficulties. At ER visit, MD noted nystagmus in one eye, no other assessment abnormalities.


Onset was sudden. Time from onset to inability to work was 3 weeks. 


These symptoms have since gotten worse: generalized muscle pain, generalized weakness (not just legs), irregular gait and difficulty walking, multiple falls, migraines (in left side of head and behind eyes, but were successfully treated with Mobic), confusion, forgetfulness (esp short term memory loss), speech and writing difficulties, tinnitus


Regarding pain: Began in right knee, felt like both stabbing and pressure, worse with walking. No redness, swelling or signs of inflammation. Lasted a month, then was also in left knee. After a few weeks, it was in my right hip. Over the next year it spread into my left hip, lower back, then shoulders and upper back, and finally my hands and feet. Feels like it's in the muscles and tendons, sometimes hurts on palpation. 


These symptoms have since appeared: hallucinations multiple times a day (visual, audible, tactile), worsening GERD with regurgitation and delayed gastric emptying, hypomanic episodes (dx bipolar-2) that have increased from every other year to 3 times in 12 months, bladder issues (difficulty starting and emptying completely), intermittent ED and night terrors


Newest symptom started April 2020: choking and aspiration, especially on liquids, at least once a day


Improved or resolved: falling asleep spontaneously, tingling in soles of feet


Current meds: lithium 300 mg BID, Seroquel 300 mg qHS, Effexor XR 150 mg at HS, 75 mg in AM, Mobic 15 mg daily, omeprazole 40 mg, melatonin 6 mg qHS, Valium 1-2 mg PRN, ProAir PRN

Lithium levels always WNL. Tremor started 3 years ago. All psych meds unchanged in 5 years. 


The following tests were performed with no abnormalities: head CT and MRI without contrast, dozens of labs, CK, inflammatory markers, lithium level, Lyme test, ANA, EMG and NCS, EEG, neuropsych battery, XRs of cervical and lumbar spine, skin biopsy of small nerve fibers


Treatments: 

Started on vit D and B12 for borderline levels


GDRs of psych meds were attempted twice but were stopped after one week, and were ineffective. Psych ruled out side effects and psychiatric causes. 


Muscle and joint pain not made better with ice, heat, ibuprofen, Tylenol, Celebrex, meloxicam, tramadol, or creams. Better with rest and repositioning. Muscle relaxer not prescribed d/t fatigue, driving issues, and falls. 


Pain PT and Vertigo PT were ineffective, ruled out an inner ear problem. PT noted pendular nystagmus on one visit


Currently: 

Unable to work since May 2019. Able to perform limited amount of all ADLs. The only current plan is to wait, and contact neuro if it ""drastically worsens"". ",1
"Hi, I hope somebody can help me out with an idea of what's wrong or what kind of specialist to see.

I had symptoms of COVID-19 after being exposed to an infected family member the 9th of November. I had the usual fever (for a day), cough, and malaise. My oxygen saturation never dropped below 95% during the ordeal and it is now 97%. I felt better within a week, and do not have any remaining physical symptoms.

Emotionally, however, I'm a wreck and have a very short fuse. I've had these symptoms for around 10 days. Anything and everything makes me fill with rage. I can also feel intense sadness for no reason. I have never experienced this kind of irritability in my life. I have had depression for a long time (I have been on Effexor XR, lowest dose -- 37.5 mg for 8 years, still taking it), but I have never experienced anxiety or this kind of emotional ups and downs. It's driving me crazy.

I suspected high blood pressure, because I once felt irritable when I had an hypertensive episode, but my blood pressure is 110/75. O2 sat is 97%. Temperature is 97 F.

I took a B-complex for a few days, which did absolutely nothing (I've heard it can be ""good for the nervous system""). However, yesterday I woke up with a slightly sore neck because I had used a different pillow, and took diclofenac (50mg), and within 45 minutes the emotional troubles went away. No more sadness or rage. I was back to my old normal. It was like magic, but how can an NSAID help with emotional issues? I don't understand. The effect lasted the entire day and I thought the problem had gone away for good.

Today, however, I'm irritable again. Slightly less so than other days, but still irritable. I'm waiting for it to get worse before taking diclofenac again.

What could be going on here? Systemic inflammation? Brain inflammation? Should I consult a neurologist or a psychiatrist? Or should I just wait it out? It is extremely upsetting. Also, if diclofenac gets rid of the symptoms completely, is it ok to continue taking it for some time?

Male, 38, do not drink or smoke or take any drugs. Height: 5'8"". 200 lbs. Medications: Effexor XR 37.5mg, Atorvastatin 10mg, Amlodipine 10mg.",1

Hey I need help!

I am having some issues and believe it may be adrenal issues and want help on what to ask my doctor and what we should test for.

1. Headaches. They come randomly and can stay for hours.
2. At times severe insomnia. Other times extreme exhaustion to the point I cannot stay awake even if I tried.
3. I feel so weak and shaken at times I can’t do much at all. I even get occasional dizzy spells.
3. I cannot focus or concentration. I have so much trouble doing anything and am having a hard time remembering to eat, drink or even take meds.
4. I usually feel better when I wake but as the day progressed I get slowly worse and worse.
5. My mental health is all off. I am super moody, get random spells of extreme panic and anxiousness.
6. I feel so dehydrated and even when I do remember to drink I just feel so dry. My skin is itchy and dry.
7. My joints and muscle are sore and it’s hard to move.
8. I am craving sugar like crazy. When I try to eat normal foods I have no appetite.
9. I am having terrible night sweats. I can’t control my temperature lately. I am either burning up or freezing.
10. I am extremely sensitive and scare easily. I seem to have no stress control and get anxious or overwhelmed easily.
11. My allergies and sensitivities are much worse lately.
12. Edema of my face, lips and tongue are acting up.
13. Occasionally I have reactive hypoglycemia that’s so severe I must be extra careful and then other times I can eat a bag of candy with no issues.
14. Reoccurring elevated liver enzymes. Multiple testing done, including liver biopsy, with no definite answer.

These symptoms happen on and off a lot in the past five years. It has gotten this bad in the past but by the time I got in with the endocrinologist I was feeling better.

I’ve also had a new symptom in the last year I keep having issues with my right ear. It seems something is pressing the nerve and making it go tingly and numb.

This concerns me because the nerve for the ear is close to the pituitary gland. Should I ask the doctor to check that out too?

Thanks!",1
"After having a heated argument with one of our housemates the police were called and we were arrested and thrown in jail til the next day.The other housemates broke into our room while we were being arrested and gave them an empty bottle of Gin that my roomie and I finished drinking earlier on in the evening. We are currently out on bail and face the judge tomorrow morning where we would almost certainly be given the 40 lashes as punishment.Any advice from redditors on how to deal with tomorrow?
Edit: My friend and I are both non-Sudanese and are working with an Ngo and have been in Sudan for the last 6 months.All of the other guys that we share the house with are Sudanese and take Islam pretty seriously(only when it suits them). Also we are on our own since we had specific instructions from the Ngo not to drink(or at least get caught) but its our fault for not resisting the sweet temptation of Gin and lemonade
Proof: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/zZvhv.jpg) Couldn't think of anything else that could provide proof without revealing identity
Edit2:Hey Reddit thanks for the words of support and advice. I just got back in from meeting up with some of my Sudanese friends. The court hearing is tomorrow at 8am and im told the judge isn't very good with English so we are bringing along one of our friends in case a translator is needed. On the advice of some of you guys I got my hand on some valium at the pharmacy and will take two before court to ease the nerves. What one of you guys said about the lasher having a Quran under his striking arm seems to be true so I guess there is a limit to how hard he will be able to hit.The punishment will take place in public, so ill get my friend to take some pics and ill give an update when I return home.
Ps.Reddit is on the censored list in Sudan and blocked so theoretically speaking I can be punished for accessing it.The life of an outlaw [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/HpjQv.png)
**Update**: Just reached back home and glad to say im in one piece.We showed up at 8am and were led to a sort of holding area under the 40 degree sun for about three hours. There were about 75 handcuffed men waiting to be punished for drinking moonshine and other trivial things like peddling clothes on the street.The guys who were not able to make bail and spent the weekend in prison were given their lashes first. The whip looks like a 2ft long garden hose wrapped in leather with a 6 inch wooden handle at the top. The atmosphere wasn't as intense as I thought it would be(maybe because of the valium) but when the first prisoner started getting his strokes things changed. The lasher didn't follow the rules about having a Quran under his arm so he just went all out on some of the prisoners till some of them danced around in pain.The fucked up thing is that they don't only hit your back but also all the way down to your hind legs which hurt like hell. 
After the first batch were punished the lasher went for a breakfast break and we were told to come back in an hour. We had some breakfast and then returned to the courthouse. My Sudanese friend had a contact in the court so he managed to get us bumped up to see the judge first and also to let the lasher go easy on us.My drinking buddy was called in first and then I started to sweat bullets. He was in there for about 5 minutes and then made to sit down on the corridor.My name was called right after and then I went into the the ""court"" and the judge asked simple questions like my name, my nationality ,where I live and then finally my religion. The only thing worse than being an atheist in Sudan is probably being a goat rapist. So I told him I was a Christian and that I accept full responsibility for my actions.He then sent me out to the corridor to wait for the strokes. Before I had the chance to get comfortable on the concrete floor, my name was called to be the first to get the lashes. I got up placed my hands on the wooden door in front of the other prisoners/onlookers and mentally prepared for what was to come. I kept my eyes on the crowd and held onto the door tightly. The first few lashes weren't bad as they were mostly hitting my wallet and pack of cigs in my back pocket but after a few lashes he went for the hind legs and then up my back which hurt.The entire punishment went on for less than two minutes and I said ""shokran"" at the end to the lasher which means ""many thanks"" and then walked out feeling like the shit for not flinching.My friend was called next and he had the same reaction as I did but just looked down to the floor while he was being punished.In total I received 39 lashes and he got 40 and had to pay a $35 fine since he's Muslim.We got our passports back, went back to our flat pissed on the beds, cleared our room out and moved in with one of our friends till later on in the week when we return to Khartoum. We were not allowed to take pictures of the lashings and we hardly have any wales on our backs or legs but here is the aftermath [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/x3Abw.jpg).Also I secretly took some pictures of some of the guys waiting for punishment.[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Uyq2N.jpg)

"Accountant can mean a million things - it is the most broad.  You can be a payroll accountant or a bookkeeper, or if you work for a big company that needs lots of accountants you could be even more specialized like, someone who only deals with accounts payable, or the proper way to record revenue on the books) more complicated than you’d think). Anyway the term “accountant” is very general and I would translate it as, “someone whose job it is to track record and process financial things.” 

Not all accountants are CPAs - in fact I’d say most aren’t. CPA is a special license you get from your state after passing an exam which allows you to go into public practice. It’s illegal to say you’re a CPA when you’re not. The idea is that if you are a CPA, then the public knows you have a general competence level.  You also need to be a CPA in order to provide certain services legally. So a bookkeeper working for a company as their employee doesn’t need this. But if that bookkeeper wants to start her own business and offer her services to lots of clients she might be legally required to get a CPA license depending on her state laws and what services she wants to provide. Potential clients will also look for the CPA designation as a sign that the person has  a decent competence level.

Audit and tax are two services which you nearly always need a CPA license to do. Tax, everyone knows. Audit is not like “tax audit” or “IRS audit”. It actually means auditing a company’s books to make sure they are materially accurate. For example, to make sure that bookkeeper isn’t a complete fuck up, or the executives aren’t scamming making the company look more profitable than it is. Or a million things. Companies traded on the stock market are required to have annual audits because investors make decisions about whether to buy their stock  based on their financial statements. Other companies often need to get an audit because they have taken a loan from a bank, and the bank wants audited financial statements once a year to know how the company is doing.  Outside of the US, in lots of countries, almost all companies are required to get an annual audit even if none of the above apply - it’s just the law for everyone,

So anyway that’s what auditors do in short - they check the books to make sure they’re not fucked up or fraudulent.  HOW they go about this is super complicated and also really boring to talk about.

The End!",1

"So, this is I think my first post on reddit, I don't usually tell people stuff and I try to keep as much as I can to myself, I always tended to read other posts when I was in a bad way, but I also always felt the need to share this, although I’m really not sure where to start it and this is the only subreddit that fits my category at least to some degree, all I know is that it’s going to be a long one so be prepared if you’re going to read it. About 2 years ago I started having problems with insomnia with no clue as of why I started having it. It lasted for months and I didn’t know what to do. And as those months passed by I just learned to live with it, or at least i thought I did. I lived with it like it was normal. I always tried to socialize a lot, although being a little introverted throught my life, and have had some problems with anxiety and depression, because I wasn't really accepted by people as I had some anger issues when I was younger. But I found ways to cope with it. Insomnia and anger were really just minor issues I resolved when I was at that young age. It was caused by RLS (restless leg syndrome), which I had to mention now because it's an important factor later up in my post. Anyways to get back on track after those few months I suddenly started feeling very good, I thought it was too good to be true. It genuinely felt like that. But I also felt it wasn’t for no reason, I started watching some self-help videos, but I also did a lot things that were mentioned in the videos, I took advice from it and did it and started exercising in the gym almost every day. I started feeling more connected to the world all of a sudden and really started enjoying life. The only problem is I couldn’t bear to be in a bad mood or unmotivated because I would feel like crap, and everything I did had to be perfect in my eyes, I always smiled even if I didn’t feel good, and did everything I was supossed to do and thought was right (did good in school, exercised a lot) all while having as little to no sleep, to this day I still sometimes amaze myself how i managed it, but am also really dissapointed for not taking care of my insomnia because I didn’t take it seriously and had no idea of how dangerous it is. It was like a code in life to me. In some ways i faked it till I made it. Every day I was telling myself some positive things and even went as far as faking to be really extroverted and very talkative, I pushed myself to the limits in every aspect of life and everything I did. After some time I adapted to it and it became like a lifestyle. Felt like i was finally where i needed to be in life. I also started having these big ideas and was feeling very mindfull. Every day I did something, any chore, anything that I felt was getting me closer to those big ideas I had. Then there was this night that I remember clearly to this day. I couldn’t sleep and I started having all these dark visions, for example I had a vision of a blown up house in an apocalyptic setting, everything was really foggy and grey, I remember there were more of these visions, but this one stuck with me because it felt so real. Throught the night I felt extremely anxious, uneasy and depressed. The next day it was all blank, I almost felt like I lost all of my personality and character, I felt like a little kid that had to learn everything all over again (how to socialize, study, etc...). That first day I tried to cope and did, with some little breakdowns along the way which I thought were nothing major. It wasn’t until the second day I felt so exhausted and lost. I felt nothing and everything at the same time. It was bizzare. Keep in mind that throught all of this time I still had insomnia. Every day was worse as I just couldn’t keep up with my expectations and others'. I also remember crying a lot everyday, literally crying for about an hour just so I coud feel some relief from the exhaustion. After some time I decided to go to a psych clinic and they gave me some pills for sleep. I thought if i could get some sleep maybe my problems would be resolved. I took a dosage that was said to ""knock you out like a horse"" by a doctor. I took it and absolutely nothing happened which was fascinating to me. I didn't know what to do next. I was starting to lose hope. Then I went to the clinic again where i took a test that was supossed to be my diagnosis. The doctors looked at it and diagnosed me with acute depression and psychotic symptoms and this is where my story with the meds start. I was taken to a psychiatrist that prescribed me the antidepressants, antipsychotics and valium that I mentioned in the title. I started taking them and it was only after a couple of months that they started working on me. But through those months i still suffered from insomnia and it all felt so weird. I always had the need to move, i couldn't sit straight or stand for 5 minutes without feeling extremely anxious which made school a big problem for me. I could only lie in bed or walk and that was the only time i didn't feel anxious. Depression was always there, though, from that I unfortunately couldn't escape I didn't feel joy in anything. It was a nightmare, especially because I knew that I could feel good in life as I did before, but for some reason I just couldn't. At first I was taking valium so I could sleep, but I tapered off because I didn't want to become dependant on them, which in turn made my anxiety a little worse. One day I even looked back at the pictures I had from that time of myself, which there weren't a lot of because, well, you could assume why. And in them I had such an empty look in my eyes. I really didn't look well. I had just one friend i hanged out at that period in my life because i couldn't handle groups of friends as I had extreme anxiety. But after those few months I finally started sleeping a little nad it felt like I was getting back to a somewhat normal sleep cycle. Eventually I started going out again, slowly going back to my old ways and started feeling a little better, I was so happy and relieved that I could just sit and enjoy a view or even play some videogame without feeling anxious or depressed only problem was I was getting fat and for me, that was a really big problem, I had the need to eat a lot. Probably because of the SSRIs. In a year that i took the meds I gained about 12kg, messed up my liver and developed thick blood. Mentally I was getting better, but physically I was on a downward spiral. Not gonna lie the past year I had all in all a great time and the meds helped me a lot. But I told my psychiatrist that I think I'm ready to quit the meds. I knew I needed them at the time, but they were messing with me physically. And at the end of the summer I quit. I firstly tapered of SSRIs and then tapered of abilify, I was on the most minimal dosage possible. I felt some withdrawal symptoms, but I went through them. Later on (about a month in after quitting) I started to develop some anger issues again and my RLS returned after many years which caused my insomnia to also come back. I tried to push through, but this time it wasn't just depression and anxiety that was the problem. I started acting abnormally. I got in a fight with my dad and made him cry and even with my grandparents because I started talking about some family stuff that happened in the past that really made them sad, damn writing this I really feel like a bad person, I still feel guilt from that because I really wasn't acting like I was supposed to. It felt like I was only having anger outbursts, depressive episodes and feeling like I'm literally going crazy in between. I had to go back an abilify to stabilize until my psychiatrist could find an option that would fit my needs because I didn't want to gain anymore weight. Eventually my psychiatrist found a ""solution""; ziprasidone. As soon as my psychiatrist told me about it I started investigating it. And I mostly found negative reviews about it. But I decided to try it. At first it was actually pretty good, I slept well, maybe too well because I also slept for about an hour throught the day which I rarely did before because I could only ever sleep at night. After a week in it started feeling like nothing, and I started to have the same problems I had from abilify withdrawal. So I had to start taking a double dosage for it to work again. I'm now maybe about 2 months in, but had to start tapering off it because I couldn't keep my eyes open when I was in school, I felt really drowsy. Now I'm back on 1 dosage at night. The problem is my insomnia came back. And now I see no other sollution but to go back on my old meds. My psychiatrist already prescribed them to me. The thing is I can function at this dosage of ziprasidone, but I need to take a double dosage of valium to sleep and I've been on that combination for about 2-3 weeks now. Ziprasidone in a way is good because I don't really have the need to eat a lot so I don't gain a lot of weght, except when I have to take the dosage, then I eat a little more, but lately I've started going to the gym again and started losing weight and am afraid of gaining back weight if I return to my old meds. I want to quit valium again, but I know I won't be getting any sleep without it. I still have no clue what happened those 2 years ago I practically lost myself overnight. But I don't want that to happen again, whatever it was. I'm just really unsure of what to do now. I really want to look good again and lose weight, but don't want to fall into that pit of depression and anxiety because of insomnia. Wow, that was a lot! I didn't really know where else to post this, so I hope I got it right. To anybody that read all of this, thank you.",1

"Ever since Sunday, when Putin raised the nuclear threat level, I’ve been in a near constant state of panic. I’ve been sweating in the night, I’ve been thinking about it nonstop, the pit of my stomach feels sick and cold, my hands have been freezing. I went to my doctor yesterday and my blood pressure is high. I got prescribed Valium, which seems to work for a few hours but doesn’t change the state of things, so when it wears off, that anxiety just comes right back.

I was watching Biden’s speech last night and it gave me some reassurance that at least our leaders in the US seem pretty confident that they’re navigating this situation in the right way, but then at the very end, Biden has a dumbass off-script senior moment and says “Go get em!” which sounded a lot like “go get HIM” (Him being Putin) which immediately sent me into yet another World War 3 spiral. “What if the Kremlin is watching and hears it that way, and decides to cut off all diplomacy and go nuclear?” Just awful thoughts. 

I know the current situation does not affect me. I live in NYC. I have no friends or relatives from Ukraine. I feel scared and depressed whenever I think about what the regular, every day civilians just like me are going through. But selfishly, I’m scared for myself and the greater, wider world. That makes me feel awful too.

I can’t even do normal stuff now to distract myself. I was playing Elden Ring and all I could think of is “oh wow, how fun, wait, what if I get an emergency alert that Russia is attacking a NATO country” or I’ll listen to a pleasant podcast on my way to work and I’ll think “this sure is nice, oh wait a minute, what if I get an emergency alert saying that a NATO country has shot down a Russian plane?” It’s crept into my brain. 

I just wish there weren’t WW3 implications here. I want to be able to think about the people of Ukraine and their struggle without also catching myself and remembering that a serious enough misstep by the West could mean nukes get fired. But then again part of me knows they’re unlikely to get fired. Putin won’t end the world over some ports. But I only half believe that. Im just so fucking scared. 

I know there’s a lot going behind the scenes on every side of this to avoid WW3. But that “what if” is killing me. I’m not suicidal yet, I’ve been there and this isn’t that, but I feel like a few more weeks of this stress is all I can take. I’m not built for this. I’m too sensitive and scared. I curled up in a ball and cried yesterday. I’m just fucking terrified. I hate this so much. I’m depressed anyway, also live with anxiety, and I feel like this is taking years off my life. I just hate this. I don’t want to die in a nuclear Holocaust. No one does but the threat feels so immediate. Like I’m in constant fight or flight but there’s nothing to do. I’m just so sad.",1
"So basically I've had mental health issues since middle school. I'm 23 and they started when I was 12. I had depression but recently it's gotten to the point where now I am bipolar. I also have OCD, ADHD, and Anxiety. I have tried over 25 medicines and none of them worked. I am super sensitive to medication and whatever med he prescribes me it seems I get side effects from, currently I am on valium and I have been getting a rash and am constantly itchy. I just went to the psychiatrist today and he's scared to put me on anymore meds because of how sensitive my body is to them. These past 4 months have been the worst of my life. I've had short term memory loss, time is going faster then normal, and I'm always screaming and just suffering. I had to quit my job and it's gotten to the point where im on reddit asking for help because I feel like I've reached out to everywhere I could and I can't get help. He recommended Neurostar for me and honestly I just wanna get better because I can't live my life like this anymore but I'm worried either due to that or medicine I'll end up with permanent damage. I was only getting 3 hours of sleep a day for 3 months straight as well. I can only sleep if my mom is in the bed, otherwise im in a state of hypnosis it seems where im not asleep but not awake. I know this is a long story, but basically I don't know what to do or where to go for help. I'm worried if I go to an inpatient hospital they'll just pump me with meds and I'll just have a ton of side effects/permant damage. I'm seeing a neurologist soon but if nothing comes from that then I feel like im screwed. So I guess any advice or guidance would be welcomed. ",1
"this post is going to be extremely long as i have a lot to cover but hi. please i need advice and i need people to tell it to me like it is. can’t believe im seeking help thru reddit ??? lol

i have struggled my entire life with unmedicated/undiagnosed autism and adhd. i was only diagnosed with autism last year and with adhd about a month ago, after seeking the diagnoses for about 4 years. 

it all started in 2020 when quarantine hit and i had to isolate myself. i began to discover more and more things about myself including my interests, sexuality, morals, etc. but then, it took a turn for the worse and i began self harming, begged my parents for professional help but unfortunately didnt get any until i attempted to overdose on valium (idk i just picked up whatever there was and took it lol) i got put on anti depressants and antipsychotics went through a ton of different doctors found the right ones etc but my main goal was to make it out of high school alive. which i did! 

i graduated 2022, 2 years ago now. ever since then, i’ve been through a shit show. i met a boy who broke my frail lil heart bc his frail lil heart was broken too. after that, i lost my shit (but only) high school friends. picked up smoking weed. went through another group of shit friends. at the start of this year i overdosed on molly purely accidental but it rlly messed me up for a bit. then i finally met some more cool ppl and made new better friends, leading me to meet my first ever girlfriend, we dated for 3 months then she broke up with me like 2 weeks ago. 

im just feeling so lost. i’m back to square one. i steal my dads prescribed medication and i steal weed from my housemates. drugs are the only things that i have going for me right now. whenever im not high, im craving a high. i dont have a job or any further studies because no one is hiring me because i forgot how to mask and every course im interested in is full.

i’m so dependent on my parents too. i live with them of course, but my mum does basically everything for me. she makes my appointments, pays for everything, makes my food, washes my dishes. i feel like a baby. but i can’t ever find the motivation to do these things for myself due to unmedicated adhd/depression/burnout combination 

i spend every day just trying to pass the time. my mind is constantly racing, thinking about how to better myself, thinking about projects i plan but never start, thinking about how other people perceive me. always distracted, i can never live in the moment. sober living is such a burden and everyday is another day closer to death for me and i just patiently wait until i can go to sleep and don’t have to wake up again. a mental countdown until the next time i can get high or drunk.

please. provide advice for a young woman so i can learn to love life and actually want to live it. medication? interests? purpose???? i just want to live a quiet life in a cute little cottage with my wife and 3 cats ",1
"(TLDR: I've been struggling with OCD and GAD, which manifest as health anxiety and muscle tension, especially in my neck and shoulders. After a bout of severe anxiety-inducing situations, my mental health collapsed, leaving me bedridden and unable to manage daily activities due to severe muscle tightness plus health and death anxiety. I'm seeking advice on facilities that treat these conditions, preferably on the East Coast, as I'm aware of Roger’s and McLean, but McLean has a long waitlist.)


Hello everyone,

So recently I’ve been struggling with my OCD and GAD. In the past they primarily presented themselves as health anxiety and accompanying muscle guarding and hypertonicity in my pelvis (much more rare nowadays) and neck/shoulders (much more common nowadays, nearly daily)—I am a skateboarder and have taken some nasty falls in my time. I was functional but just barely. I struggled with being alone and driving far places as the constant movement of the shoulder muscles caused me tenseness; it wasn’t pain yet. I went on a vacation for a little over a week and went through some very anxiety provoking situations like driving 7 hours as a passenger through nothing but woods and farmland with no health facilities for hours on end and only once did I have a panic attack when driving back to the city I realized that every health facility was on the opposite side of the Mississippi and I started to panic but took some Valium and muscle relaxers and worked through it.

But starting about two or three months ago things became agonizing. When I got back I got pushed through some very difficult things by family and it just caused my mental state to completely collapse. I became essentially bedridden and was so tight with my muscles that all I would do was drive 10 minutes over to the local urgent care because of my anxiety and then I became even worse because the pain led me to have thoughts that I was on the brink. I started having death anxiety which is something I had as a child but ultimately went away. I can barely get myself up and about, I never shower because my muscles have become so tense I can’t really lift my arms up and bend my neck to make the motions to comb my hair. I have fallen down and I cannot seem to get back up.

I come here seeking advice. Please does anyone know of any facilities that treat conditions like this. I’m from the East Coast but I’ll go anywhere to get better I just want to function again. I want to be able to live my life without not being able to move my body because of how tense my anxiety over my health and rumination over death make me. As a last note I do know about Roger’s and McLean: only McLean is in network and its waitlist is 6 months to a year and I’m hoping for a quicker start to treatment.",1
"So I had an injury about 10 years ago and required multiple spinal fusions to remedy nerve damage in my pelvis and leg. I have micro spasms in my pelvic muscles that squeeze my prostate and bladder and can keep them irritated for 90% of the day when it happens. These spasms randomly occur but can be brought upon from anything ranging from anxiety(clenching) subconsciously, sitting upright for too long, or even lifting something that makes me strain. Anyways, I’ve been put on every medication known to man until they found a cocktail that worked. I was on gabapentin for years but recently changed to Lyrica for nerve pain, a muscle relaxer(baclofen), and Klonopin. Their reason for the klonopin was that it will keep my subconscious anxiety at bay (never had a problem with actual anxiety), was told it was an excellent muscle relaxer, and lastly while I was having my groin pain it would basically make me care about it less. I never would have guessed it but it actually works great, better than opiates imo. I’ve also tried Ativan, Valium, and Xanax, but the klonopin did the best. However, over the last few years on klonopin I have noticed that I’ve lost interest in everything I once enjoyed. My friends ask me out but I’d rather stay home, I LOVED video games but now I can’t even get myself in the mood to turn them on. I’ve even lost all interest in dating or even attempting to talk to women. I’ve never had a problem with depression which I was starting to think it was, considering I can’t work anymore and most my friends have moved on, not to mention the constant pain. However, my doctor has tried me on anti-depressants but I don’t really think I gave them long enough because I felt they made my emotions worse. We tried amitryptiline, Prozac, Cymbalta, and Wellbutrin. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced this from Klonopin and what countered it, since I have to take it for the pain. I’m on 1mg 3x a day but I only really take it once a day since it lasts so long, but never more than twice a day. My mom has had great experience with buspar, which she said can be used for depression but I haven’t talked to my doctor about it yet. Sorry so long but that’s my story in a nutshell. Any input would be greatly appreciated. ",1
"I've spent a lot of time on this sub and thought that I would finally make a post to ask for some advice. Sorry in advance for the long read.

I am just about to turn 20 and have been struggling with my mental health for the past 12 years of my life. Most of this was due to bullying at school which lead to me attempting suicide at the age of 8 as well as being hospitalised twice, once for a mental breakdown which resulted in me getting sedated and another due to me trying to jump out my window and then kept in hospital for 3 days. This lead me to suffer from severe social anxiety and an attachment disorder with my parents where I got incredibly anxious about leaving them. I then suffered from lots of bullying as well from the ages of 11-16 which has left a lot of deep insecurities on me.

Another bit of information is that I have suspected for a while that I may be autistic since I have lots of sensory issues as well as struggles feeling emotions such as empathy and picking up on social cues and understanding people. I have also experienced autistic meltdowns fairly often where I get overwhelmed and often result in head banging to stop myself from thinking. I also have always been very obsessive and get new hyper fixations which generally last for a few months until I begin to lose the level of interest in them though it never fully goes.

Due to all of this I have been borderline suicidal for most of my life and the last year and a half has been particularly bad since leaving home to go to university and at one point was self medicating with alcohol. In the last few months my mental health has taken a turn for the worst and had a bad mental breakdown/autistic meltdown at Christmas and tried to wrap and elastic cord round my neck. After that I began looking at options for therapy, which I have now started, mostly pushed by my parents and girlfriend but also got really hyper focused on psychiatry. I have also been referred for a diagnosis for Autism.

In my research I came across OCD and I believe that I have that as I have always had a lot of trouble with disturbing intrusive thoughts, rumination for hours and hours about things that caused me anxiety. Reading in the r/OCD sub made so much of my life make sense to me and why I act the way that I do. I have also obsessively researched into antidepressants to try and find out all the information that I could on it in.

At the end of March I started the SSRI Citalopram (Celexa) at 10mg which took a about a week to start causing side effects which were: sharp increase in anxiety, apathy to food, fatigue, insomnia, hyperactivity, trouble focusing, increased sensory problems, jitteryness/restless leg syndrome, increased suicidal ideation and mental breakdowns/autistic meltdown. After a month of this medication during a mental breakdown I attempted to kill myself by strangling myself with dressing gown cord.

Due to this I then went back to my GP the next day and got my medication swapped to the SSRI Sertraline (Zoloft) at 50mg which I have now been on for 10 days. I was also given 6 Diazepam (Valium) at 5mg for when I get really overwhelmed.

Since being on Sertraline I have been struggling exceptionally with focus and sitting and in research as to why I found that ADHD can be exacerbated by SSRIs which would explain the uptick in my symptoms from starting when I began taking them. When reading up on ADHD I realised that I have been suffering from symptoms of this for years where I always struggled with concentration on tasks that did not interest me, did poorly in exams, engaged in risky behaviours, only could work when stressed and deadlines approaching, always fiddling with something, feeling the urge to climb and do pull ups on scaffolding, issues with impulsively speaking, had to be walked like a dog when a young child due to endless energy and chronic procrastination.

I was never considered for ADHD as I always performed well in school in maths and science but much worse in the subjects that did not interest me. I was also fairly well behaved due to my social anxiety being quite debilitating at times.

So that is my backstory up to the present and here is where I am at the moment. My plan is to come off the Sertraline basically cold turkey as I have only been on it for a short amount of time and am on a very low dose. Then I am trying to get diagnosed for ADHD and then try some medication for that to see how that helps me with my inattention and hyperactivity. After that I will then antidepressants again to help me with my depression, anxiety and OCD. I plan to try the SSRI Fluvoxamine (Luvox) as it seems to be better for OCD and has a nicer side effect profile without any major drug-drug interactions with ADHD medication.

If anyone reads this I would really appreciate any advice you could give me on my plan and any tips to help.",1
"Hello Everyone,  
As a 27-year-old man, I have been grappling with depression and generalised anxiety disorder for what feels like an eternity, tracing back to my high school days, and possibly even before. My early twenties brought with them a series of diagnoses - Depression, OCD, and anxiety disorders, which only served to confirm the internal struggles I had been wrestling with. Two years later, around the age of 25, I discovered that I had been living with ADHD all this while, a revelation that provided a much-needed explanation for the suffering I had endured for most of my life.

  
One of the most pronounced symptoms I experience is emotional dysregulation, which often leads me into the depths of depression or depressive episodes. The debilitating anxiety I face daily further fuels my ADHD symptoms, creating a vicious cycle that can be, for lack of a better term, quite distressing.  
However, I have always endeavoured to maintain a positive outlook and remain hopeful, despite the challenges I face. I believe I am a good friend, often being the one to lighten the mood and create a lively atmosphere in social situations, trying new things and trying to enjoy my life as much as possible. Unfortunately, my efforts have seldom been reciprocated. People don't seem motivated to forge friendships with me, women tend to steer clear from me, seemingly detecting my depression and anxiety from a distance, all of my experiences never really created a life that I am happy about. Life has not given back in equal measure to what I have offered, and I have been subjected to repeated instances of trauma, including developing PTSD from witnessing fatalities right before my eyes.

  
Recently, I found myself sinking into another deep depression. This time, it was significantly worse. I neglected my personal hygiene, started to miss work repeatedly (to the point where I'm surprised I still have a job), and became easily irritable. My temper flares quickly, resulting in me shouting at or being rude to family and friends. I cut ties with social media, deleting all my accounts, and abandoned my hobbies. I turned to heavy drugs in an attempt to cope with the turmoil within.

  
However, about four days ago, something shifted. I felt as if a mental block in my brain had been abruptly removed. Initially, I was disoriented, feeling as if I was dissociating from my own self. But when I came to, I noticed a radical change in my personality. The naïve optimism I once held about the world, the belief that I needed to be a beacon of hope amidst the storm - these notions had all dissipated. I have turned unemotional, blunt, and brutally honest. I have lost the capacity for small talk, and my tolerance for people has diminished drastically. I have become more self-centred, and I cannot hide my facial expressions, especially those of disgust or disappointment. My relationship with my parents has changed, and I find myself unable to tolerate their habits that I once found endearing. In essence, I have stopped caring and have morphed into a version of myself that I find distasteful. 

Strangely, though, I do not feel anxious or depressed anymore when I am in this state. I feel more aligned with myself, although the sense of loneliness has intensified. But I don't really crave for social interactions, and I certainly don't feel the need to be nice to people. I have stopped expressing my emotions as I fear they will be used against me or form the basis for someone's perception of me. This has been a complete paradigm shift for me.

  
I would appreciate any insights or thoughts on what might be occurring. Have I reached a saturation point with my depression and anxiety, leading me to transition to 'the other side'? Or could this transformation potentially be beneficial for me?

  
Please note: Yesterday, I have just started taking Prozac and valium to help me sleep.",1
"Istg im on seroquel 25mg rn. I used to be on valium WHICH ACTUALLY HELPED but they put me on seroquel instead because valium is addictive. I have such bad panic attacks and have to take the seroquel in a panic only for it to give me dizziness, racing heart beat when standing, confusion, reading things wrong, headache, feeling off, etc. 😍😍😍😍😍 I love my life. Im so short of breath rn and went to the ER yesterday bc I thought I was dying from these side effects. Turns out im fine, I just took a bit too much, but they wouldn't give me any other drug or pill so im stuck. Im not 100% sure its the pill, but they said it was unlikely to be smthn else and it gets worse after I take it so...every doctor keeps saying this dose is safe but idek bc i don't feel good after taking it AT ALL.",1
"Dizziness started in mid November 2021, went to Canberra on the 10th of December and I had my first near faint experience followed by high heart beat and palpitation. 

Dizziness and lightheaded was followed till the 28th of December when I nearly fainted again and had really high heart rate: went to hospital. They did blood work and ecg couldn’t find a probable cause. Went to hospital again 3 days later and no findings were evident. Upon my 3rd visit to hospital X-ray was done off my chest and nothing was found. I was bedridden for 6 weeks, everyday was a battle for life, I felt like I was in septic shock everyday. I had to get iv fluids about 10 times because of dehydration, I sweated constantly with no appetite for water or food.

Symptoms 

Lightheaded 
Dizziness
Heart gets tired quickly 
Sometimes my arms and hands become a little numb.
My head feels tension.
heat in my abdomen, back and my ears get hot.
Feels like a pulsating feeling through my body during a bad episode 
Sometimes left shoulder feels warm
My eyes sometimes drop tears randomly
Unable to concentrate at times
Shortness of breath during episode 
There’s always a tense feeling in my chest and around my heart area. Sometimes hits my lower abdomen and I feel nausea makes my stomach make noises. I have difficulty sleeping my head spins more when I close my eyes. I wake up between 1-3am with a weird feeling as if I’m scared or something. Vision sometimes becomes blurry. Fatigue and tiredness. Little sudden Noises scare me. Whenever I have a episode that peaks, my hands and feet get sweaty and I feel heat. My hands and feet sometimes get cold. The feeling in my mid left chest area I can’t explain but it’s as if my muscles are vibrating. When I stand up it’s seems my head and chest symptoms get worse for about a minute and then settle down. Same thing happens when I lay down. It gets worse for a minute till it goes back to how it was. Sometimes I can feel it hitting my front part of my head and my sinus feels tense as well. As well as my ears feel the pressure. Lying down seems to reduce some tension in my head. I feel bad 80% of the day really bad 15% of the day and alright 5% of the day.


Let’s go back to my childhood, my earliest memory is probably when I was around 10. If I would focus on my breathing it felt like I couldn’t breath anymore. I also had these unexplained spinning and dizziness at a young age during sleep time. Doctors couldn’t find anything. I was always a scared kid thinking about the worse case scenario that might kill me but in reality it was overthinking. In highschool a few times I nearly fainted out of the blue. Sometimes during sports I’ll hit a point where out of no where my heart would start racing and my breathing would become laboured. Sometimes over excitement caused this as well.

Now medications 

Lexapro 40mg for 6 months, no benefits. Made me really bad during the first 2 weeks and kinda of settled after that, dumbed the depressive symptoms but that’s about it.

Zoloft 50mg for 18 days and 100mg for 3 days, had a panic attack on day 3 I thought it was Zoloft but found it to be thc later on. Discontinued Zoloft then. No benefits during the 18 days on 50mg and made my condition way worse.

Paxil 20mg for 2 months, probably one of the strongest reactions to any ssri, daily panic attacks losing my mind, as if there’s a laughter in my head but it’s my internal monologue creating it but still I was losing it. Pushed on for 2 months and it just made me worse as the days went on.

Agomelatine 20mg no benefits, daily panic attacks, took it for about 36 days.

Pristiq, I’m on day 54 and I’ve stopped taking it, my last dose was on Wednesday not sure how to stop. It’s making me worse, mood is swinging, brain fog and all other symptoms are reappearing on this medication.

Clonidine didn’t do much except relax my body alittle

Lyrica, knocked me out at 25mg and made me tired. No benefits.

Valium 5mg, very small relief, short benefits 3-5 hours, more of a muscle relaxant, addictive in nature.

Xanax 2mg, haven’t tried 

Ativan 1mg only have tried 0.5mg and it didn’t do much.

Currently my biggest challenges are

I think I’m developing schizophrenia all the time, and I’m going to lose my mind.

I’m hyper vigilant and see things in the corners of my eye.

My physical symptoms cycle throughout the weeks and I’m never symptomsless. Physical or cognitive I always feel something.

My mind always feels like as if something is off,

As my overall condition gets worse my brain fogs becomes really bad and my hands and feet become so cold to the touch, 

I become very forgetful

I can never stop thinking about my condition, my mind is occupied by it 24/7

When I go into crowded areas my physical symptoms become much worse, such as brain fog heart rate and jelly legs.

My internal monologue never shuts up and it’s always active.

Racing thoughts

When I’m on medications l as ssri’s I get irrational fears such as being allergic to nuts or something crazy. But seems to go away after a month when discontinuing  the medication,

Lightheaded, feel like my neck muscles are so tense that my brain isn’t getting enough blood.

I’m hyper focused on all bodily functions physical or Cognitive, if I suspect something that is schizophrenic or damaging I get a mini panic attack. But panic attack do occur for no reason as well most of the times.",1
"My father stayed with me while taking quite a few different pills, though he has literally got two broken arms and an infected skin graft they aren't all prescribed. There's not much point getting into it but I know my interactions and pregablin with cannabis pregablin, codeine, valium with the previous too all have bad reactions and I was worried. 
This turned to annoyance when he woke up yelling at me a lot. He was so out of It I thought it was the drugs I've seen him fucked up a few times isn't new spoiler: it wasn't and even if it was it dosent change things
No I took him home in a taxi and guided him to his flat door (he couldnt walk properly)
I thought finally he'll be okay.

One hour later I get a call your dad's been found bloody on the street collapsed I don't know when the ambulance is getting there. 
He had a heart attack. And it's so fucking obvious to me I should have called an ambulance honestly I'm shocked he was outside that saved him. If he didn't go out which it's strange he did he lives alone. And his death would be entirely my fault.
There's such a high chance he could have chosen to not go out.. its a miracle he survived I told him I basically killed him but he's a dad ""don't worry about it it isn't your fault"" he said same as my mum
They don't understand.
I was cold when my instincts should have made me phone 999 no I wouldn't have I'm too used to seeing people fucked up its instinct to me they wake up no. No. No. No. No. No. No. How could I fall to such a pathetic low that my brain wouldn't think of my dad's life huh? That would be used to people on drugs like that! No. Never again. But that changes nothing I almost killed my dad. My fucking father the one who cares about me more than anything he would've phoned them. And I didn't. 
I must be too self involved fucking moron Jesus why. Am I like this agh",1
"I only started smoking weed about a month ago. I’ve only smoked about 5 times since I started. Two weeks ago I decided to smoke after taking a 2 week almost 3 week break. I smoked with a friend from work and a former coworker who is also a friend. Everything was fine with the first blunt but I started losing my high feeling. So we smoke another one which I took two really deep inhales on. I usually take every small inhales so I think I just over did it. Anyways, I ended up getting super high and struggling the whole night. My friends had to take care of me until I went home. The next morning I woke up to go to work but realized I was not okay enough to do so. Thankfully my job let me come back in later that day. But once I got to work I was able to last about an hour before I broke down. I sat outside the back of the store crying and feeling just emotionally numb. Anyways fast forward same thing happened the next day at work. I managed to take about 2 weeks off of work to feel better. I have been slowly improving but i’m still not myself. The first few days I was numb to everything. My hearing was reduced and I couldn’t even feel the water when showering. after about five days since I smoked, I went to the doctor and the doctor just scolded me the entire time. I’m not smoking anymore and that I shouldn’t of done it which I knew already and so I’m just crying in the doctors office and he does nothing for me just tells me that it takes about two weeks for the THC to pass on my system and he prescribed me Valium for anxiety and that was it and so I’ve been taking the valium like every few days on and off to conserve cause I only had seven tablets and sometimes I flareup really badly but it’s been almost 2 weeks. It’s been almost 2 weeks since I smoked but I’m still feeling awful like I took off work for two weeks but I’m supposed to be scheduled for this coming week and I don’t think I’m gonna do it. I just feel like this one blunt really just ruined my life because now I feel like I can’t even function. and I just feel like it’s more than just the weed passing through my system. I feel like I was just ignored. My symptoms were ignored because the doctor had some thing against weed and so now I’m just stuck feeling like dog shit and I’m going through summer classes for college right now. my head starts hurting randomly and when I walk around, I just don’t feel like myself I look in the mirror I don’t even look like myself I take a video of myself I don’t look like myself I look smaller to myself, and I just don’t recognize my normal self like I don’t know what is wrong with me I’ve considered checking myself into a mental hospital this week. Just hopefully so I can get some answers to why I’m feeling like this but just like it’s not gonna help because it’s weed related so they’re just gonna brush it off and I just don’t know what’s wrong with me

If anyone has any advice or personal experience with this, I would appreciate it.",1
"Hi everybody! My mom (53 y/o) is in serious need of medical advice, we both speak in Spanish as is our native language, we are latina. I came here looking for help on her behalf since the psychiatrist she's going to now just can't seem to get her diagnosis/meds right. I asked her to write down her full medical history + symptoms (which I translated) so maybe you could guide her to see if the treatment she's currently taking is alright or if she should get help from another professional:  
  
*I started my treatment with my current psychiatrist 6 years ago, he diagnosed me with anxiety, panic, and phobia. I started taking 50mg of Zoloft, I was already taking 1,50 mg of Neuryl every night; I was getting worse by the day. I was told to take 1,50mg of Zoloft every day + 1,50 of Neuryl... he also added Pregabalin 1mg, because I started to feel bad and all my articulations and muscles hurt. But that didn't work! He later added Valium which made me tremble when I told him he switched Valium for Alplax, with a dose of 0,25mg 3 to 4 times per day.*  
  
*What happened with Alplax is that I feel like a have some kind of ""monster dormant"" I could feel everything (anxiety, phobia, etc) but my body couldn't react to them until the hours would go by and with it, the effect of Alplax. The problem is that once the effect wears off I feel awful, pressure in my chest and shortness of breath...until I take the Alplax again.*  
  
*Today by my own account I reduced a bit the dosis of Zoloft 0,50mg and I just want to get rid of it in a progressive way-*  
  
*but with 1mg of Neuryl without Alplax, I have episodes of anxiety.*  
  
*My psychiatrist says that Zoloft doesn't produce any kind of muscular/articulation pain and that it doesn't produce more anxiety, even if when I reduced the dose all the pain I talked about disappeared.*  
  
*I spoke to a traumatologist and didn't saw anything wrong with my body, told me that until I fix my mental health problems the rest won't fix.*  
  
*What should I do?*  
  
Thanks for reading and I hope we can get some answers. Have a nice day :)",1
"I don’t know exactly what’s wrong with me, I’m constantly anxiety fueled. If things go off course a little I will have full episodes of aggressive anxiety. My anxiety is constant I overthink every step I take, every decision. I get decision paralysis, which after enough time becomes exhausting, so exhausting that I become tired.

 And right around the time I get tired I become depressed. I’m anxious, I feel bad for doing nothing but if I do something I get more anxiety, which sometimes leads to me moping around all day or rarely becoming irritated.  I’m not mean to anyone, but i can be dismissive or become a martyr. I can’t focus because I overthink a task so hard that I give up, forget about it, or make an impulsive decision that leads to me being disappointed later. 

I’ve always handled it okay, I get things done. I have a few healthy friendships, I tough it through the rough emotions and come out the other side with accomplishments. But the sheer amount of struggle it is to just do everyday task is really taking a toll on me. 


It’s gotten particularly bad as of the last 6 months or so, I’m starting to not be able to accomplish things, I’m always napping, or so anxiety fueled that I can’t even talk sometimes. 

I’ve tried therapy a few times, every time I feel like it doesn’t help. I try the things they tell me, I journal, I switched therapist thinking “maybe they aren’t the right one” and I had no luck. It just doesn’t work for me. 

I’ve been very against medication since when I was younger I was on depression meds my pcp handed out like candy, which I tried 3 different kinds from 13-17 and they led me to the WORST depression I ever had. I was given Xanax for anxiety and the sedation feeling made me so miserable I eventually ended up having full bottles of it stacked up or flushed down the toilet. 

But now I’m more open to it, but I just can’t do anti depressants or Xanax. And I don’t know what is out there, but I know I just can’t live like this anymore. There has to be something to help.

Im so nervous I’m going to go and they’re just going to try to prescribe me SSRIS or Xanax or Valium or something. And after putting this off for months it’s just so stressful. 

This is more of a vent than anything, but if anyone has good experiences with doctors taking their mental health seriously I would love to hear them.",1
"I've tried everything and still I just don't want to exist anymore.
I have a lot to say so enjoy your day if you can't be bothered reading. Edit: this turned into a small book. I expect no reply now lol (nice vent tho).
This is the first time I've posted on anything in an attempt to speak out online, I don't know where to begin. This is my last pathetic attempt at getting help before I'm out of options I think.

Nothing brings me happiness and I don't want to be haunted by my thoughts anymore. But before I explain how I currently feel and making myself sound like a weird idiot, there's a lot of context leading up to my current mental state.

Context and history: I am currently 17M  living in Australia. I've been looking after myself since I was 12 (being left to make my own decisions without consequence or homeless).
I was viciously abused since before I could remember, going as far as a dislocated shoulder from being swung into a wall when I was 2. Both of my parents were meth addicts and are mentally ill, my mother has bipolar and my father has schizophrenia while also both have been in a drug induced psychosis, they met in a psychiatric ward of course. I was sent to live with my grandparents when I was 2 and returned 8 months later to no change (don't remember obvs). My father was imprisoned for 2 counts of attempted murder when I was 5 or 6, so he was unable to protect me from my mother and before then he wasn't around much anyway since she always kicked him out and he never witnessed any of the abuse.

I don't remember much from my childhood other than beatings, being kicked, punched, jumped on, bitten or having my head and body slammed into things, all before the age of 8. That's where I consider my childhood to have ended. My brain has blocked out chunks of my life I assume I cannot handle. My mother mentally messed with my head after each beating saying she was sorry and promising to never do it again and buying me toys, so I always forgave her and reassured her i still loved her. On the other side of her, when the Department of Child Protection would occasionally question her and interview me since someone reported a child covered in bruises, she would threaten to murder me if I told anyone of her behaviour. Classic right?

At my mother's worst point, she took us to the other side of the country on impulse where they have much stronger, purer drugs. It was here she went into another full blown psychosis, having delusions she was God, the creator himself. While also having delusions and brainwashing me that I was either Jesus or Satan (randomly changed her mind). I would be worshipped or beaten randomly based on who she thought I was. I was raised a Christian so these ideas and concepts were not foreign to me. I knew something was wrong with my mother but was clueless as to what drugs were and had no idea insanity was a thing. I'm ashamed to say I somewhat believed her. It might have something to do with the fact that every time I questioned if this was true I was stomped on. But I knew no different. We were bouncing around hotels and living in a car, in the hotels when she would hurt me, if I made too much noise she would stop and threaten to kill me before resuming. I don't know why ""God"" would punch and kick ""Satan"" rather than just ending my suffering. She did nearly kill us both a few times tho which was disappointing when she didn't follow through and my torture continued.

When we eventually came back home (relative paid for our return), the delusion continued. This is the last i remember before moving back in with my grandparents. I don't remember being told none of it was true. I don't remember being saved from my mother. Next thing i knew after I turned 7 I was in a new school in a new home with a ""it's in the past and doesn't effect me"" attitude and getting weekly counselling sessions. I still loved my mum and wanted her to get better, she was my only friend my whole life since i was obese and bullied. I just wanted her to stop hurting me. She got clean, I wouldn't say mentally healthy, but during our supervised visits she made living with her again sound great. When I was 9 I moved back in with her, while the physical abuse stopped I was being forced into studying the bible with Jehovah's Witnesses. While these study sessions were ""optional"", if and when I didn't want to participate I was treated like sinful filth.
She started blaming her mood swings and her screaming at me on food allergies or something, I just dealt with it as apart of life.

Fast forward a few years to when I was 12. I still had no friends since my mother always wanted to move around and told me I wouldn't get bullied at another school lol. She didn't want me making friends anyway since they were ""worldy people"" or ""sinful and a bad influence"". It got to the point where she would only let me leave for school right before it started and timed how long it took for me to get home in an attempt to minimise my time around bad influences. One day she let me go to the skatepark with some new friends i made after school, where she followed on her push bike and saw a couple of my friends holding hands (innocent childish bf gf thing). She then started screaming at all my 12 year old friends calling the girl a sl*t and broadcasting to dozens of my schoolmates how disappointed she was in me for hanging out with those types of people. She made me run in front of her bike while screaming names at me all the way home in front of everyone.

When we got home, she told me to pack my stuff and go move in with my dad who just got out of prison, this was a usual thing and normally I'd beg to stay but this time I just left.

My dad didn't know how to parent, he was more of a casual friend that I was more intelligent than. 2 weeks after I turned 13 I decided I was old enough to try weed and see how this ""gateway drug"" felt and get a better understanding as to why my parents threw their life away for a high. My father supported this decision and even paid for the weed. I understood too well what the fuss was about. It was at this point in time I had realised my PTSD was more present than I realised. Every 30 seconds I have a random childhood memory pop up that I usually just ignored because that was the norm. When I got stoned, I was very in the moment and didn't think about my past. It started tormenting me that I was now aware that most people don't think about the worst things that ever happened in their life constantly, I wanted to think like a normal person. 

This started a new era of problems. Long story short I ended up blackmailing my dad to let me smoke, telling him I'd find someone who sells weed on the streets and risk getting arrested just so I could smoke and explained it would be much safer for me to just smoke at the house and give me money for it. He was honestly fine with it for I'd say about a year and would even surprise me with weed as a gift and gave me smoking tips, rolled me joints etc. Eventually he asked me to stop and I had become depressed so I ended up in a detox facility being fed valium for 2 weeks by the time I was 14. By this point I was only stopping weed because I was on 200mg of zoloft and was told it would work better without drug interference. I was sober for 3 months and thought about nothing except my childhood, I am no longer able to push away the bad memories, they'll randomly pop up in another 2 minutes anyway. So I did what distracted me best and started smoking again, my father allowed me to start back up and even started buying me tobacco to mix so it would last longer. The best part was I was now apart of the teenage stoners, so I  felt like I had friends at least. I rarely went to school and when I did I was high.

And then he met a woman, got engaged within a month, she moved in and the next night when I was at a friend's house I got a text saying ""your stuff will be out the front"" in a panic I rode my friends scooter home where my dad told me to start packing. I cooperated, I knew the drill. We started arguing when he just stood at my bedroom door like a bouncer, waiting for me to leave. I just wanted him to leave me alone and give me time to pack, his girlfriend started calling the police from the other room, where I could hear her saying that I had broken into the house and was trying to attack her. Keep in mind I am 14 at this time. The police are there faster than I've ever seen and I have about 6 police officers storm through the house with tasers drawn, where they see me peacefully sitting on my bed packing a bag. I explained the situation and as mad as they were about the exaggeration on the call, my father was still kicking me out so they had to take me somewhere. I wanted to go back to my friends house to return the scooter and be somewhere comfortable but they wanted to take me to my grandparents house. When I put up a struggle and swore at one of the officers, I was choked against the wall, slammed onto the floor and handcuffed all whilst I can hear my dad and now stepmother yelling ""stop resisting, son"" and ""have fun in juvie!""

Living with my grandparents didn't last very long, I lied about where I was going one night and they found out. They told me they were going to find a new home for me and expected me to go to school while they did it.
I hope it goes without saying, but by this point in my life, everyone who was meant to look after me has either abused, betrayed and/or passed me around like property. I felt worthless and unlovable, believing my behaviour was unacceptable and yet somehow uncontrollable. I only continued with my weed smoking at an attempt to numb myself, I still don't see why I've been treated this way my whole life. I've never meant harm for anyone I just want peace and to be left alone. I might do illegal things but if I'm not hurting you, mind your damn business I've got enough going on. My mother admits to her terrible parenting and claims I was the best behaved child she had ever seen, and that's true because i was too terrified to misbehave. My dad supported my drug use until it spiralled out of control where he then passed me off to someone else, who also couldn't deal with it. I left school that day, before leaving I told the school office to call my grandparents and tell them I'm not coming ""home"" and I'll look after myself.

I left for my aunty's house, around this time I got in contact with a female friend from an old school, we started dating while I was still couch surfing random relatives and friends houses. When I finally had nowhere left to go I asked to stay with her since her mum knew me of me and I had nowhere else.

We'll call this girlfriend Ruby because can't use names?

Ruby's mum was also a massive meth addict, which I hated but tolerated, she would leave for days at a time leaving with very little food or a way to get to school. Of course Ruby and I spent our time getting stoned, having sex and finding money to survive. It was a very strange and serious relationship for two 14 year olds. One day Ruby woke up with extreme stomach pains, unable to stomach any food or even speak. The doctors couldn't find the cause. We were sent home at every attempt of help. Ruby became very underweight and unable to go to school, but I found that when she got stoned, the pain would ease and she could eat some food. Of course her mother never cared and made no effort to help apart from the occasional lift to a useless hospital.

This is where my true hell begins. I should have left. I couldn't help her. But I couldn't leave a crippled teenage girl with no mother or father, my first love, to fend for herself. She couldn't sleep or eat because of the pain, I couldn't sleep or eat while seeing her in pain or being woken up from it. My priority was no longer looking after myself, but helping her. I sold everything I owned to get more marijuana, just so she could have a bit of sleep. We were always waiting for an upcoming doctors appointment or scan that was supposed to find the problem. It was supposed to end. These appointments would be months apart, so I had to get us through it. We ran out of things to sell. I sold my Nintendo switch which was the one thing I wanted to hold onto, and then I started selling weed.
I did what I set out to do. I provided. I made enough money to keep her stoned enough to eat, pay for groceries, get myself to school, give us a life. From ages 14-16 this is how my life was. During this time I developed my own chronic nerve pain which crippled me, but due to the stress I was already under I refused to get it checked out and lived in constant pain, just like Ruby. Only Ruby had it easy. All she did was sit and smoke and wait for appointments and take all my money and ask for things and watch me tear myself apart from stress of being a criminal and being trapped in this prison of providing for her with no support. When I finally convinced her to get a job to start paying for her own weed, things changed. It still wasn't enough money. She smoked too much. I smoked too much too because it's how I coped with the stress. I started becoming resentful and abusive, both verbally and physically. I'd hurt myself and her, begging her to break up with me tell me to leave. But she always wanted me to stay. I was too weak to leave. She got to have her share of hurting me too, believe that. 

This was just how we were and I put it down to the horrible situation we were in, not blaming either of us for our behaviour but instead blaming the environment. While my mind was too occupied with hitting my drug dealing deadlines escalating to selling both weed and MDMA for maximum profits, Ruby started to hate me too. To her I was just an angry, abusive, drug fueled monster. She started to have sex with multiple coworkers behind my back, even sending nudes nearly everyday for 3 months. I was oblivious. Eventually I got back in contact with my mum, who happened to be painting a house and offered me a contract to earn some cash  I took this as our opportunity to fix our life. Ruby was now managing her pain and getting to work, she could now buy most of her own weed. I was heavily dependant on marijuana to relax me as I'd grown to be in constant flight or fight mode. I assume thats because I was always under threat or being robbed or something going on. I wanted to go away to work and buy us a car to help me sell even more drugs or get a full time job and save to move out.

She blocked me while I was painting. Out of the blue. Turns out, all the times she threatened to kill herself if I left, saying she wanted to fix our relationship, making plans for the future, it was all a lie to get me to stay for longer. Before I knew it I had all my friends showing me her nudes and videos of her hooking up with other girls on instagram, the stories I heard after made me sick. She took it as her opportunity to run to her grandparents house and escaped me. I didn't even try contact her again. I took it on the chin. It plays in my head everyday. 2 years I wasted looking after someone, becoming an abusive monster in the process much similar to the one that used to abuse me.

My mum let me move in with her and her new husband. I started a whole new life. I got sober. I got fit. Looked after myself, had my pain looked at and treated, got back into studying and getting into the process of starting a career as a heavy machinery operator (it's easy and pays well. Haven't had much time to discover my passion or something I love doing). Got a couple qualifications under my belt but ended up becoming a traffic controller just after I turned 17. Moved out into a friend's house and rented out a room. Bought myself a sick car.

Ruby got back in contact nearly a year later and apologises, begging for forgiveness, much like what my mother and father have done in the past. And much like those times, I ended up trying to forgive her. While also trying to earn forgiveness myself because she was not the only one to blame.
I couldn't handle it. The memories. Thinking of what she did. I resorted back to the angry monster that I can't control and was worse than ever. Just when I started to control myself and show improvement, we had an argument over her sickness which was still an issue but I refused to help anymore, and she just said ""I can't do this anymore."" That was the last thing I heard her say before she got in her car and drove away, right before I got a phone call saying she was placing a restraining order on me.

I've started smoking weed a lot more frequently than before I got back with her because I'd often times use weed to relax around her (probs made it worse.) I'll also mention now it wasn't just weed I used, I had also abused various prescription pills and alcohol since I got out of that detox facility mentioned before. I've breached my restraining order a few times because I'd really like closure or to at least say goodbye or something and now I'm being charged and waiting for court dates. I really don't care lol. The breakup didn't push me over the edge. It was me being pushed over the edge that made me do something as crazy as getting back with her.

In the last year I've done a lot of self reflection, learned a lot because surprisingly enough, I've always managed to go to my weekly or fortnightly appointments for the last 10 years. I am plenty educated on the human brain, it's chemistry and how trauma, drugs and poor mental health effects me. Knowledge is not the issue.

Now here we are you know my life story, only left out a few minor traumatic events and things I've been through lol. So let's get started on THE CURRENT PROBLEM:

Throughout all of this I have felt the same. Miserable. Riddled by thoughts of my past everyday. Both the things I've been through and guilt from what I've done, especially while I was selling drugs. I've racked up some bad karma. 

It's the classic ""oh playing video games isn't the same anymore"" but it applies to everything. Food is just something to keep me alive. Every activity is short lived and pointless. Being distracted during the day doesn't change the fact my last thoughts for the day are that of not wanting to wake up again. Drugs don't make me feel better or worse, just different and sometimes I get really sick or really high and I'm distracted. The only relief I ever get is being distracted. I can't work through this. I've talked about this and explained EVERYTHING I've said here to professionals. Their advice doesn't help. Meditation doesn't help. Being strong didn't make me feel better. Making more money than any of my ""friends"" doesn't make me feel better. I'm already on antidepressants that also doubles as a pain medication. I refuse to change medications because if my pain comes back, I will kill myself without hesitation. Uncontrollable crippling pain is something I refuse to live with especially when I got no one looking after me. Oh and it's undiagnosable because they can't actually find the cause it's just suspected to be nerve pain or a misfiring receptor or something like that. So I don't have a legitimate reason to not work. Also hahahahah I spent so long with the pain and have such a high pain tolerance, I never even told anyone because they wouldn't believe me, I hid it that well.

I shouldn't have to constantly push away memories of me being beaten. I shouldn't have to constantly think about my previously broken heart. All of these things have led me to deeply distrust every person. I have no one anymore. Everyone in my life loves me conditionally. Or they leave. I'm sick. I shouldn't have these thoughts constantly playing in my head. I can't think about anything else. I feel like I'm beyond help. I don't want to work a job, I think about killing myself all day and how the money isn't worth it. I just wanna get high. When I get high I wanna go to sleep. When I go to sleep my nightmares wake me up.

I can't find any sort of spiritual enlightenment because of my religion based trauma, I have anxiety attacks from just stepping in a church of any kind. I constantly question my existence and why I was put here. I have to believe it was for a reason. I'm not a Christian anymore and it kills me. If there really is no God this really was for nothing. I might as well cut my suffering short. I'm surrounded by humans who I don't relate to. You have conversations with other people and actually enjoy it. I just told my 2 ""best friends"" that they're random people I hang out with to get high with and not be bored because that's how I honestly feel. They've both betrayed me in the past as well, telling secrets about me or stealing from me so I've detached myself from opening up to them, the times I have they are too shocked to actually give good advice and it's not their burden anyway.

I don't want to make new friends, as much as I may not be a Christian anymore all I see when I look around is filth. Loveless sex, kids doing drugs, broken families, fake families. Every person is a copy paste of the last with minor adjustments. Everyone fits a stereotype and I want no part of it.

Do not get confused. I am no longer bothered by the actions of other people really. I've more accepted this is my life and these are the people the world has to offer. And that's the problem. I feel like I'm getting to the point where I'm OK with being another druggie that kills themselves. No matter what I do, my life isn't original. We all spend our lives working, go on a few holidays, or do a less popular job that ""brings you happiness"". Or you do drugs and go that way. I don't know how to explain it. I just feel like since life is so predictable and in a sense not worth living. It's not that good and eventually I'll be dead and won't even have my memories anymore, which up until this point haven't been good anyway. I have no appreciation of the life I've had and trust me I've had my fair share of near death experiences. It's only ever come up again in my mind when I fantasise about if I actually got that sweet death. When I die I'll be like any other suicide victim, forgotten after a couple insta and Facebook posts, maybe a photo of me in a few houses.
I've been happy for short times and even thinking about the happiest I've felt, the rest of the day was boring. The good is not worth the bad.

Why do I even write this? I want someone to agree with me. Everyone says the same thing like a bunch of faceless clones, acting like life will be great if I'm sober, healthy and doing well financially. But I can't sit here and say life isn't worth living for a fact, because so many people disagree, but no one can convince me.

Maybe it's worth living for you. But for someone with my background and experiences and the things I have to live with... maybe it's not worth living. If anything, I think it's worth dying for. All I want is genuine happiness, the closest thing I can get to it is that shallow happiness you get when you buy something new or get a lot of drugs. Chasing my never ending greed. I never want to bring a family into this terrible world, out of fear they might have the same experience as me or I'll ruin them like I ruined my relationship. So there goes that plan. Besides I'm a classic nihilist, we'll all be dead soon anyway so there really isn't a point.

I'll wrap it up now. So with all that knowledge, that's why I feel like I'm destined to either be miserable or end my painful existence. I am truly alone with no one left except strangers on the internet who can't help me. I'm too scared to kill myself for now and I'm just patiently awaiting death or maybe something to make me happy. I pray to whatever God that may or may not be there this is just a phase in my life and one day I won't think this way. I don't know how much longer before I snap.",1
"I just got off Mirtazapine cold turkey like 2 weeks ago. Off Kratom since Friday, 9 December, had a relapse yesterday. I started using Lyrica (Pregabalin) on Sunday, 11 December, to combat and go through the withdrawals. I took it from Sunday to Friday last week. So 5 days in total, mostly 150mg in the morning, two days another 150mg in the evening. It really helped me to still go to work, be able to finish my tasks, and get out of bed or my apartment. I still suffer badly but it's the only thing that really helps me do something, get out of bed, and have way less social anxiety (still shy and introvert but way less antisocial and anxious, more talkative, esp no physical anxiety like shakes anymore). I took it these 5 days, then 2 days off (last Saturday and Sunday), then today again 150mg in the morning + 100mg in the evening as I had a university essay and a presentation today. It helped. I even think about going to the gym now, I managed to eat one whole meal so far, which is great.

My doc even prescribed me lyrica for daily use or whenever i need it but I never have been taking it more than once every one or two weeks as I was and still am horribly anxious about lyricas own dependance and withdrawal that can be bad according to some people. And that using it regularly just makes my condition worse in the end and offers me another bad withdrawal time that puts me even deeper to the ground of deep depression.

As I suffer more than anytime, probably because of withdrawing from Kratom AND Mirtazapine (while I thought Mirtazapine has no severe withdrawal, might also only be the kratom withdrawal), and I don't eat (lost 5kg/10lbs in these 2 weeks), I don't sleep and feel very fucked, insane, can't move much or do anything functional, I was wondering if it would be the best to just go back on Mirtazapine. But otherwise I'm very happy and proud that I got off Mirtazapine and don't have to take it daily anymore. I just don't know what to do. I know lyrica would help me if I continue taking it. But I also know there can be harsh withdrawal for many people who take Lyrica daily. Mirtazapine might have withdrawal, too and maybe I should just use this opportunity to finally get off Mirtazapine (which even didn't help my depression much, did nothing for my social anxiety, BUT it made me eat and sleep which can contribute to improving depression). Mirtazapine is the 14th med Im trying now, without much or any success. Life still has been a daily pain and suffering since trying these meds and 3 different psychotherapies for 5 or more years now.

What would you do in my position? Get on the lyrica train as many do and swear on but also many suffer from withdrawing in the end? Get back on Mirtazapine and hope to be better in one or two weeks, finally eating and sleeping again, and getting back on my weight (I always was skinny but now am really thin cauese of not being able to eat or drink at all).

Also my doc just prescribed me Lithium (as my 15th med to try plus 30mg Mirtazapine - my doc doesnt know that I quit it) on last Monday but as I don't suffer bipolar depression and I couldn't find any information or studies for Lithium being succesful for unipolar depression or social anxiety (which is my biggest source of depression) I just hesistated to take it until now.

Otherwise I also have many supplements left I still wanted to try and had hope that they can be finally ""heal"" me. Lavender extract, Bacopa, Rhodiola Rosea extract, SAM-e, Dopa Mucuna, Lemon Balm, Gotu Kola extract, Magnolia Bark extract, GABA (not bought yet but maybe was thinking of: Kanna, Lions Mane Mushroom, DXM low dose, Polygala, Tongkat Ali?). Can any of these be helpful for my withdrawal and depression and social anxiety even if 14 pharmaceutical meds didn't help?

It's hard to decide which way to go as all of these meds need time to work and I don't have the time or ability to suffer that long until I know if a med or supplement works or if it does not.

* Lithium seems so unuseful for my issues as there are only studies using it for bipolar, but I don't have bipolar depression, still my doc sees a reason why she prescribed it to me, I guess, as next trial after 14 failed meds and 3 failed psychotherapies. I just don't see the reason as there is no science I can find behind it.
* I could take Mirtazapine and I know I'd probably start eating and sleeping again in 1-2 weeks thanks to Mirtazapine but otherwise I think I might get dependent on it (Idk if this is withdrawal from Mirtazapine or Kratom or both, but if it's Mirtazapine too, I'd be better now off of it than prolonging the use and withdrawal of Mirtazapine).
* I surely won't touch Kratom again for a while as I've really been dependent on it, and it just fucks with my mental health after one week daily use and I also don't eat on it to get effects on empty stomach 24/7. It just isn't worth using it daily and I have to take a looong break from it until I can start using it like once a week max. Because I know when I only used it once a week it was effective and giving me good results but daily use just worsens my state a lot.
* I could continue Lyrica, with the very high risk for dependence and withdrawal when trying to quit it one day but I know it works for my social anxiety better than any med before, even if it's only a little lift. Otherwise many use it daily as no other meds worked and they just pay the price for a bit of life quality and one day going off of it with bad withdrawals and maybe long-term damage (?). How's your experience with Lyrica as therapeutical daily use for depression and social anxiety? Ever tried to get off of it? Is it possible or a very bad idea to use it daily even if it's the only thing helping a bit?
* I could try any of the above mentioned supplements I still haven't tried (I tried many others before without success but maybe you have some other supps that helped you with treatment-resistant depression and social anxiety when no other even strong pharmaceutical meds didn't help. but at that point I also think, if strong pharmaceutical meds couldn't help me or treat me right, how could a supplement do?)
* I could ask for another medication than Lithium. I will surely tell my doc that I hesistated to try Lithium until now as I couldn't find any studies on it for my issues anywhere and was overthinking of going on another med again, just failing, having no success and maybe side effects and withdrawal of it for no success or effects in contrary. What meds could I still try if 14 meds didn't work?

I already tried these meds and no one treated my depression and social anxiety, not even touched it except for Mirtazapine enabling me to eat more and sleep better:

* Escitalopram (Cipralex)
* Promethazine
* Venlafaxine (Effexor)
* Quetiapine (Seroquel)
* Sertraline (Zoloft)
* Opipramol
* Paroxetine (Paxil)
* Duoloxetine (Cymbalta)
* Moclobemide (Aurorix) (weakest MAOI)
* Amitriptyline
* Gabapentin
* Diazepam (Valium)
* Mirtazapine (Remeron) => makes me eat and sleep, probably lil effective cause of helping with that
* Bupropion (Wellbutrin)
* Pregabalin (Lyrica) => lil effective

All no success. Plus 2 depth psychological psychotherapies and 1 cognitive behavioral therapy, all failed, too. No success.

Still open to try, some meds I just noted some days I was desperated and surfing through the web for alternatives and relief:

* Ketamine (any experiences? also expensive and hard to find where I live)
* Psilocybin (Magic Mushrooms) (have big anxiety of horror trips and psychosis etc., also illegal here)
* Ayahuasca (maybe in a south american treatment center but hella expensive)
* rTMS or ECT (any experiences? also hard to find)
* Meds I didn't try yet: Tranylcypromin (Parnate, irreversible MAOI, affects both enzymes in comp to Moclobemide), Clomipramine (but serotonergic drug and ssris/snris never worked so far), Lamotrigine (Mood Stabilizer, idk if this would be making sense?), Selegiline (MAO-B-I), Amisulpride (low dose should be effective for social anxiety and drive/energy/anhedonia), Tianeptine (Sulfat/Sodium, but should have a high addiction and withdrawal risks as I heard), Vortioxitine (Serotomodulator/stimulator), Buspirone, Hydroxzine, Risperidone (Mood Stabilizer), Abilify (Add-On, potent. AD one doc I found on youtube swears on being effective for depression for every of his patients he tried it on, maybe antipsychotic worth a try?), Rasagiline (MAO-B-I), Tofisopam, Trimipramine, Doxepine, Milnaneurax, Propranolol, Dopaminergic: Pramipexol, Ropinirol, Mianserine, Maprotiline, ADHD meds (i possibly suffer from ADD and just never got diagnosed it? reason why no meds or therapies worked so far for me as wrong diagnosis?: Atomoxetin, Modafinil, Ritalin, Dexamphetamin, Lisdexamfetamin), other Benzos (Clonazepam, Bromazepam, Alprazolam, Oxazepam)

Any idea what you'd do in my position? Rn I don't eat and just starve all the time, I don't drink, I don't sleep, this is very unhealthy so I have to do something PLUS my horrible depression and social anxiety not enabling me to go out, see friends, just canceling all appointments, dont visit university anymore and probably just have to quit my masters degree and never make real friends or romantic relationships, having no future in sight, while also being cognitively very retared and probably just turned dumb, no skills, no knowledge, just no future and no strengths or anything I could offer anyone - and the anxiety I could never catch up on all these things, skills, knowledge and experience other already have in my age (im 23 now).

I feel like I've missed out on a lot of experience and knowledge to survive in adulthood EVEN IF let's say survive depression and social anxiety itself. I don't know, I surely remember when I first noticed my mental health issues that my deep depression had big impacts on my cognition and joy or ability to learn things. The social anxiety contributed to this ""cogntive performance/ability"" in public of course. Now I don't know if it might have been all the many different meds I tried or the depression or a combination which made me so freaking dumb that kills my hope for being able to live a normal life even if I'd be able to finally ever feel not fucking hellishly depressed and freakingly socially anxious once. These are thoughts like I just dont have learned any skills, any knowledge about any topic or profession, might it just be football, basketball, following it on the TV and knowing about players, I don't know anything about cars or mechanics as some men my age do and makes them somehow ""manly"" for me, I can't play any instrument or don't play any sports in a team, I don't know anything about politics or any science topic. I'm just blank. Only positive I see is that I'm at least a good looking young man, a good looking loser. I feel so unmanly because of not knowing anything about this stuff and have no skills or knowledge I can offer. Makes me suicidal and reducing my self confidence and self worth a lot. I was really often thinking about having ADD (but started only very late or no one rarely urged to test me on this as I have social anxiety and by that surely am not the hyperactive ADHD type - i heard the missing H part is the reason why many ADHD patients get ignored even if the attention deficit disorder is still fully present).

I really have big hopes on meds even if 14 different ones didn't work yet but I don't know how my life could change other than a med, supplement or any substance being finally effective and supporting me cause I tried so much (therapies, diet, sports - they only help a little) and I really think it's just my brain chemistry and it can't get better without any substance helping me... even my new doc said this type of depression and anxiety I have can only be solved by pharmaceutical help or biochemical influence from the outside as so much didn't help me until now and I tried so much.

Sorry for the long text. This makes me see that Lyrica helped me to day with my issues as otherwise I would never have the energy to write so much and not feel bad and just crawl into my bed doing nothing than starving and staring on the wall or trying to sleep and just not feel my horrible feelings of depression, self hate and future anxiety. I really am living unhealthy now, so at this moment I really take even withdrawal of lyrica just to survive. But idk if this is a very bad idea. I try to not take it tomorrow, but maybe I feel so horrible again that I have to at least eat one meal, drink a bit of water, get out and get something done for university or other todos I just skipped for 2 weeks now...",1
"I‘m 23 now, suffering from severe and treatment resistant depression since I was 15. When I was 17 I first called a professional cause I knew there wasn‘t something right with me and this suffering isn‘t normal. It mainly all started being surely problematic with 17 but the symptoms probably even started with 10 or earlier, at least I can think of similar symptoms back in these times.

So I called the doc at 17 alone first time, letting no one else know, and I got treatment. Now, 23, I‘m over 14 different medications and 3 talk therapies (psychotherapeutical depth psychological as well as CBT) all without NO success. I‘m now 23 and just got off Mirtazapine and Wellbutrin 1 week ago. Also I got off Kratom at the same time (started using he Kratom cause no treatment worked).

I now lay in bed since Saturday, doing nothing, can‘t eat, can‘t drink, can‘t move. I even quit my job on Friday. Still studying my master (have a bachelor at least already). But I just feel hell as shit now and don‘t know anything to do, I dont see any hope or any future. My cognition is also very bad, I feel like the dumbest and most worthless human. I lay way behind everyone else in my age regarding knowledge or skills, let‘say any professional knowledge but also about any sports (like following professional soccer, basketball or even playing it), I dont have any knowledge about anything, sports, cars, professions, sciences, literature, anything.

My doc just prescribed me Lithium now as next trial for medication. She told me to start taking it on Tuesday. I still didnt‘t start taking it cause I only can read it using for bipolar, never ever any studies or such for depression itself (without mania) or social anxiety and rn I just survived the day by drinking 3 beers, not eating anything or drinking more than a glass of water. I feel retarded, sad, socially incapable and dumb and no clue how to go on. Life has nothing to offer for me, it‘s such a big draining unsurvivable feeling of sadness and being imcapable.

Thinking about suicide and hosted psychiatry many times but also just looking for a quick fix as other people my age and „friends“ just live so happily and have their way rn so I dont wanna be the crazy guy being in a psychaitric wardness, especially as Id how it would help me after these many faile treatments.

Can someone msg me and tell me about how they overcome insomnia and anxiety. So I stayed up for four days straight before and it caused me a lot of stress enough to lose 2 kg. And I think I am traumatised now as I get anxious when the night comes and I have to go to bed again. Sleeping pills like valium only knock me out for one hour and then I can’t sleep anymore. Please help me I need someone to talk to,1
"Hi. I was prescribed Tizanidine for a neck injury and noticed it helped a great deal with my anxiety. I told my doctor and she started prescribing it off-label for anxiety. I was on 8 pills per day, spaced out (32mg total per day). I was having awful anxiety and self-harm issues, so I started over-taking them for a few days. Not enough to die, just enough to ease the extra anxiety. I ended up in inpatient and my prescribing doctor found out I was over-taking and decided to cut me off of them completely. The FDA website says that it is dangerous to cold-turkey this medication. It is a muscle relaxer that greatly affects blood pressure is the problem. My BP is through the roof. I went to the ER and it was 200+/150+, they had to call the CDC to ask how to get it down because nothing was working. They ended up giving me a ton of Ativan and Valium shots to get it down. They prescribed ativan to take home, but my Tizanidine doctor (it's at a pain clinic, I am on an opioid pain patch that she prescribes) said I cannot fill it (I'm not allowed to be on benzos with the pain patch), I'm miserable man, my BP is crazy and I can feel my heart beating out of my chest. I don't know what to do! She said if I pick up Tizanidine from another doctor she'll discontinue my pain patch. She can see what I fill at pharmacies. I even had an abscess drained on my chest a few days ago that was super painful and the surgeon prescribed oxy and she told me I cannot fill it. This doctor is sadistic. Ideas for the withdrawals?",1
Imn having a breakdown and it hurts me so much and if I'm not careful I will kill myself I don't wanna do that cause my grandma wil get sad I don't want her to be sad please help,1
"My trauma has been almost comically over the top. I’m certainly not saying that it’s worse than what other people have been through, as many people have endured much worse than I have, but at times it just sounds like some of it is made up because it’s so bonkers.

A couple of the big highlights are that my dad physically and emotionally abused me and my mother for years. He’d pelt me with baseballs or other sporting equipment and say that he was just playing despite the fact I was like 4 years old and covered in welts. He eventually tried to make me sleep with my stepmother, my mom made me tell the cops, they believed my dad because he was able to paint me as “troubled” and I nearly was charged with rape (as my stepmom said “oh no, he tried to rape me, that’s what happened.”) This led to me having panic attacks and extreme depression but I eventually was put in a position where I had to go live with my dad and he “treated” that anxiety and depression with Ultram, Vicodin, Valium, alcohol and cigarettes, giving me all of these things frequently. He always romanticized opiates, eventually he had me start running hospital scams for medication, then he had me chauffeuring his drug dealer, and eventually we were doing heroin together. There’s a lot of sexual assault, rape, domestic abuse, beatings, kidnapping/unlawful imprisonment, gun violence etc but I’m not going to detail all that.

What’s so hard for me to talk about is my brain needed a way to feel safe, I needed someone to protect me, and that led to me dissociating and becoming someone else entirely. That monologue from Tyler Durden in Fight Club kind of summed it up “I look how you wanna look, I f*** how you wanna f***…” etc). This went on intermittently for about 20 years but the vast majority of the time Is as either able to hide it or people just wrote it off as having to do with drugs. Every time I would try to explain it people would just dismiss it as “oh we all have different ‘personalities,’ it’s called a game face!” I would say “does your game face have you waking up in a strange hotel room with bruised knuckles?”

Back in 2015 it was almost like how it was when it started, as in I felt like “I can’t live like this,” and that pushed me to reintegrate so that I was just one person. It was painful, it was very confusing, and I did it all by myself as every time I would talk about it I was met with extreme responses. I hate that if you tell people that you have an entire other person in you they immediately decide you’re like some murderer from a tv show. It’s because of that stigma that I kept it quiet.

I guess I’m just here to get that off my chest. Despite having been able to sort it out it’s very difficult having all my responsibilities on my shoulders as I’m used to someone else carrying the load. I know logically that I am the person who did everything the entire time but it’s hard not doing it as two people if that makes sense. I feel a sadness because it’s like a marriage ending as I don’t have this person who was with me since I was 15. 

I’m doing well but I hate that I can’t talk about it without feeling terrible about myself. Anyway, thank you for reading this.",1
"In 2020 just before lockdown 1 ended , I developed a fear of sleeping (which was a huge issue). As soon as the sun would go down I’d get anxious and filled with pure terror over the thought of loosing consciousness. Then In September 2020  I started university with the same problem. One of the dealers had Valium. Valium completely sorted out all the terror and fear around sleeping so I instantly fell in love. This lead to a 7 month long high dose Benzo addiction. I had no compassion or feeling. I then cold turkey’d  thinking I would be aright. 1 week into withdrawals I took a 2 tabs of acid and I knew it was bad about 10 min after taking them; after half an hour I faded out and had a severe seizure and woke up with paramedics around me, which left me
With a gash on my head and traumatised lovely mother who saved me. 

Here’s the issue I can’t get over, 4 weeks into my withdrawal, I was feeling a bit better stayed sober, my mum bought me this 600£ stone island coat as a well done gift and we had a lovely meal to celebrate. Soo…. The second I dropped my mum off, I grabbed 20 400mg tramadol. I then proceeded to drop 14 !!!!!!!!’  The fuck was I doing. That’s nearly double the fatal dose and I knew that at the time aswell, I then drove home and some how made it back, then had another severe seizure that I shouldn’t have woken up from (juice world 🙏) and again my mum was left traumatised. 
I DID THIS 2 YEARS AFTER LOSING MY DAD TO CANCER and if I didn’t wake up my lovely mother would’ve been left all by her self Morning me  and my dad (I have no siblings. ) 
My issue is I can’t do anything Cus all I see is my crying mother and The situation is constantly playing through my head even when I’m busy. Even when I start to feel

"Memory loss is a common topic within the mental health world. I'm an RN that works in Mental Health & going to do my best to summarize some research on *which* mental health medications impact our memory and *why* they do.

**Memory** refers to the mechanisms that are used to collect, accumulate, preserve, and later retrieve information. There are three actions involved in **'memory'**: processing, storing, and recalling.

## I will Include the link to the original post that is probably easier to follow but also going to include all the info below.

## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs

**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**

### Drug class

This is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain. Over 10% of the US takes an SSRI.

### What Do SSRIs Do?

What does every medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, you’re blocking the neurons from reabsorbing Serotonin, meaning there is more Serotonin available.

So what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.

Did You Know?

Serotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. While we can measure the levels in our blood we cannot measure the levels within our brain. Meaning we’re all in the dark as to how much is within our brain and whether or not it’s even correlated to the amount in our blood.

How SSRIs Impact Memory

Age and gender do not seem to influence the data that SSRIs are correlated with memory effects. Something that is important to mention, is that while research has shown that SSRIs are *correlated* with memory loss, that doesn’t exactly mean that they CAUSE it. Correlation and cause are two different things. Many people that take SSRIs also take benzodiazepines, drink, smoke, have genetic predisposition to memory loss, etc. Depression and anxiety themselves can even cause memory problems.

Summary

So, after reading through many articles, there overall wasn’t enough credible information to emphatically say that an SSRI causes memory loss. In fact, I came across more research that suggested SSRIs improve cognitive performance and memory. Some data also specifically supported that SSRI’s can improve memory for patients experiencing psychosis and depression.

## Tricyclic Antidepressant  | TCAs

**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**

Drug Class

The word “tricyclic” refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed before SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays. TCAs are still often administered for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.

What do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?

What do all TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors. These key differences create a cascade of effects in the body that do impact memory. These key differences are also the culprit for the common side effects in this drug class like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.

Did You Know?

In 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 ( a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new 'invention' was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.

How TCAs Impact Memory

There are multiple reasons why a TCA impacts our memory. **The first reason** is that we retain memory best when norepinephrine is released at an optimal rate. These drugs block the reabsorption of norepinephrine; which is known to be a moderator of memory. With too much of it, we are anxious and stressed, too little of it and we are drowsy and not as coherent. Either way, the drug has an impact on norepinephrine which directly influences how we store memory.

**The second reason** why this drug class impacts memory is because it competes with our natural antagonists on muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is well documented that these drugs block muscarinic receptors (which is an acetylcholine receptor), and acetylcholine directly impacts learning and memory.

>*“Muscarinic* acetylcholine *receptors* in the hippocampus and cortex underlie *memory* formation”

Summary

So, TCAs are a drug that research has linked with memory impairments and dementia. These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life (even could improve memory if their extreme anxiety was impairing it), while for another it can make them drowsy and leave a bad impression.

\*Note each drug within the class impacts the degree of these effects a little differently.

## Benzodiazepines

**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**

Drug Class

These are commonly considered anti-anxiety medication (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.

&#x200B;

Let’s taco ‘bout it.

This drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which slows down our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).

Did You Know?

Anesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?

How Benzodiazepines Impact Memory

This drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is advantageously quick acting, the effects linger.  Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.

This is why a rehab center isn’t going to allow the use of 'said drug' while ‘recovering’. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking 'said drug' while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning & you're not able to remember anything, how can you work on it? The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.

Now, don't shoot the messenger. Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They're an actual life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with *repeated* use we will need *increasingly* higher doses, making the dent in your memory more and more indisputable.

Full Disclosure

My mother was an addict, benzodiazepines being her drug of choice.

Do you know an addict whose drug of choice is a benzodiazepine? No SHAME, but if so, you can probably attest that **they don’t remember shit.** 

How about an addict whose drug of choice is alcohol? All love here, but you can say for certain, *they don’t remember shit*.

There has even been a fair amount of data to support that the risk of Alzheimer’s is elevated in those taking the drug for over 6 months. One Harvard study even speculated that it would raise the risk by 84%! Seems unrealistic, but who am I to question Harvard; I'll add the link below if you're also feeling speculative.

Another point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.

This is often what is referred to as *“rebound anxiety”*  because your anxiety is likely to get worse, before it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken long term.

Take it from a nurse who works in mental health; it's not enjoyable being the bystander of a patient trying to escape their benzo addiction.

But this is why the mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time.

Now, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please don’t go flush yours down the toilet after reading this.

When Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is that we’re now in a benzo addiction crisis. We’re learning over time, as a society and those changes don’t happen overnight. And trust me, as a mental health professional I myself occasionally grow infuriated at the amount of family doctors who prescribe copious amounts of benzodiazepines only to later turn the patient away after addiction has crippled them.

## Anti-Epileptics

topiramate, topamax, zonisamide, zonegran, levetiracetam, keppra, pregabalin, lyrica, clonazepam, klonopin, rufinamide, banzel, vigabatrin,  sabril, phenytoin, dilantin, oxcarbazepine, trileptal, carbamazepine, tegretol, lamotrigine, lamictal, lacosamide, vimpat, valproic acid, depakote, phenobarbital, gabapentin, neurontin

Drug Class

Anti-seizure medications are commonly used for mood disorders and even anxiety in addition to epilepsy.

What Do They Do?

Epilepsy is caused by **excessive** hyperexcitability of the nervous system therefore, medications in this class are geared toward minimizing excitability. This drug class actually encompasses three different major classes

1. Blocking Sodium Channels
2. Enhancement of GABA Inhibition
3. Regulation of Synaptic Releases

Why it Impacts Memory

Overall, anticonvulsants work in different ways; trust me I rode the magic school for HOURS trying to gain an understanding of them to write this. Truthfully, we still have a lot to learn about them. Their impact is complicated and the effects range based on the dose and drug.

For instance, Topamax has pretty diverse pharmacologic actions, because of that, it **has** been linked with impaired concentration, cognitive dulling, psychomotor retardation, language and comprehension difficulties, rather extreme effects on short-term memory and working memory, poor verbal fluency and word-finding, reduced IQ scores, abnormal thinking and delayed cognitive speed. Because of this dark cloud of side effects, Topamax is sometimes referred to as 'Dope-A-Max'.

However, a more selective medication within the drug class such as Phenytoin or Tegretol are more specific to blocking sodium channels. Overall, they seem to have less impact on memory and cognitive function.

Many of these drugs listed above have an impact on GABA, and long term exposure to GABA agents can alter the functionality of GABA permanently, which means there are potentially permanent consequences to cognition, behaviors, and memory.

Phenobarbital has been linked to lower IQ, and worse effects than Depakote and Tegretol, however it is actually a barbituate. It’s effects are similar to benzodiazepines which you can read more about above.

Gabapentin, used for seizures and often mood disorders, belongs to it's own drug class. Still, it **has** been linked to memory impairment. Hence, the name, it also impacts GABA, which as mentioned several times now, certainly plays a hand in our ability to remember. At this point there isn’t enough research to say it’s linked to dementia though.

As far as drugs for epilepsy, Gabapentin is tolerated much better than many others. It’s also worth mentioning that this drug seems to have more *short term* effects on memory. Some will experience a disorienting feeling or short term memory loss while taking Gabapentin, but the reports of long term memory being impacted are reported less often.

[Long Term Effects of Gabapentin](https://deserthopetreatment.com/sedatives/gabapentin-addiction/long-term-side-effects/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

## Antipsychotics

**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics; risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**

Drug Class

Commonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome & Huntington's disease

What Do They Do?

Most drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.

Did You Know?

Oddly enough, memory seems to actually be improved when using an antipsychotic for a person with psychotic symptoms, though there are many that take medications within this class that are not psychotic. So let's talk about that more.

Why It Impacts Memory

First, let's skip back to the purpose of these drugs. Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it's to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.

This class is broken up into two categories;

**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which do impact the complex way in which we store memories. \*More movement disorders come with the old ones.

**Second Generation: (new, atypical):** Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors**.** Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.

What do they all have in common? **They impact Dopamine.** Long story short; A delicate balance of Dopamine is needed for memory to function. Since this class targets Dopamine, it's fair to say it has the potential to alter our memory. Whether that's a good or bad thing is specific to the patient, but it's typically an unwelcome effect.

## Antihistamines

**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom,  hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan,  triprolidine, triafed**

Drug Class

Commonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different 'generations' & target different histamine receptors in our body.

* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body
* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion
* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System
* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched

What Do They Do?

We're actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that **anti-**histamines are usually anticholinergic; **blocking** receptors for choline. The problem is that we need choline to be readily available to have the ability to learn, understand and remember.

### Why it Impacts Memory?

Being that antihistamines are often anticholinergic, they do impair our ability to think, learn and remember. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain. We already naturally produce less acetylcholine overtime. This is partly why as we age our ability to remember, think, and learn diminishes. It's widely known that anticholinergics impact memory, thinking, learning, and muscle function. It is also suggested that these drugs increase the risk of developing dementia.

Did you know?

The only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways in addition to the reason why it's administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much less specific in their effects, they are affiliated with greater memory impairment. Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings.

### Summary

Overall, the effects range. Regarding mental health specifically; Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax are commonly prescribed for anxiety. While your risks are much less severe than benzodiazepines, these are FIRST generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this is also means they do impair our ability to remember.

An example of second generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won't do you much good.

Hope this helps clarify some of the impacts of memory and mental health medications. Leave a comment if there is a drug you're still wondering about.

"Hi, was hoping to get some perspective and personal experiences living with a mental illness. Specifically, I am struggling to understand how to come to terms with having a mental illness and how to ever decide if my thought process is sane. I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis at the age of 16, and am currently 24 years old. When I was initially diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis, I was in a physically dangerous state; I have always been a thin male but during my first flare I had to try different medicines to get my colon under control when I was bordering on needing hospitalization because of aggressive weight loss. I am 5'7"" and the heaviest I have ever been is \~135lb (I was only ever able to achieve this weight by forceful eating; e.g. 4 raw eggs immediately waking up to try and get free calories, 1500 calorie weight gain protein shakes, gulping down shot glasses of olive oil, 5 minute ice cream binge sessions housing a third of a cartoon if I ever got a burst of hunger). My natural maintenance weight is between 120-125lbs with my colitis in remission state when I am not consciously forcing myself to over eat. During my initial flare I was flying close to 100lbs, partially because I was a belligerent teenager and just said had a fuck it mentality and elected to starve myself so I could actually make it through a day of school, attend parties, or socialize. I strictly didn't eat during school hours because I'd be liable to need my mom to take me home within the hour and wouldn't be able to endure the rest of the day of school with my stomach in so much pain and the diminished ability to control my bathroom needs. So long story short, was prescribed an aggressive schedule of steroids (prednisone) if memory serves me correctly it was a good 3 months I was taking 60mg a day because it was pretty much stop the colitis flair or try other medicines like biologic where a lot had studies showing an increased, but infrequent risk of cancer in young males. Don't blame my parents at all for adamantly not wanting me to touch those. I unfortunately, was in the group where prednisone caused psychological effects. Best way I can explain is it, I got all the symptoms associated with roid rage in addition to insomnia. I genuinely slept 2-3 hours a night, and while I've never taken coke or meth the side effects would be what I imagine a person using meth experiences; paranoia, grandiose ideas, god complex, explosive mood swings, and full blown suicidal ideation. I DO NOT have suicidal thoughts any longer, and got help at an in-patient facility which i stayed at for 2-3weeks on three different occasions. Fast forward and was able to get my colitis under control and after about a year finally felt like the steroid related side effects subsided but was diagnosed with bipolarity which conveniently aligned with the steroid therapy catalyzing. No one ever explicitly said the steroids caused my mental illness but most medical professionals agreed it was very possible the steroids triggered the mental illness's appearance. Okay now that back story is explained. My main question and appeal for advice is how does one ever trust their conscience and thought process anymore. I feel like I spend 20-30% of my brain power a day, having to manually vet every thought I have to try and prove it is a logical, sane thought. I take Lamotrigine 200mg, which I do like and have no side effects from aside from the benefit of it helping me to bounce between a -50 to 50 sanity scale versus -100 to 100 without it. For some odd reason, I am terrified to try any other psych medicines aside from benzos. I ran through all the top medicines prior to Lamotrigine and had varying side effects so I'm petrified to ever take a pill that alter my brain chemistry. I lost like a month of memory on seroquel, don't even remember who I was on cymbalta, clomipramine worked mildly but at the max doses it didn't help much. I am against a wall and a hard place, because I am so stressed over being insane and questioning every internal thought I have. I wake up limping because stress dreams are causing me to curl my toes so hard I'm ripping my calves muscles. I want to try and get Valium to just calm down my head and relax my muscles, but I imagine no one is ever going to prescribe it. I currently have a psychiatrist who I check in with to get my Lamotrigine refills, but will be trying to do some televisits with some new ones to get their vibes and see what they think and what could help, but I just can't do this bullshit with exercise to release stress yada yada. I work out multiple times a week, go for runs, drink a gallon+ of water a day but all those activities still afford me too much time between push up or running stride to think. Sorry if im all over the place, just really fucking discouraged that after 6 years of having shit under control it feels like my psychological health is digressing again.",1
"Please don't judge me by the title. I have my dearest friends struggle with depression and I understand it all. I am always there for them as their support system. In fact, I talked a friend out of suicide numerous times and got him professional help.

I always believed that I was mentally strong enough to not get depressed. I now realize how ignorant I was and a hypocrite at the same time. I have also had a friend who always claimed she was depressed but it was more of an attention seeking behavior than anything else.

I am a 34 M and when I had my heart broken for the first time (I truly loved her) when I was at uni, I list my appetite and I lost interest in everything and became extremely introvert. My friend forced me to go to her mom's for dinner. I didn't realize that I was actually being counseled as her mom is a psychiatrist (best in Auckland).

She told me that I was sad because of the break up, heartbroken and down. All natural and normal tendencies that make us empathetic humans. However, she did mention that I am way weaker than I believe and I could get depression and it will hit me without even realizing. She just said that she hopes I have a good support system if and when that happens.

Years have passed since. I have been through a divorce, career change, lost all my life savings but never got depressed. 

Every time I feel down I self meditate and I believe in facing challenges head on rather than dwelling in the past.

But, now here comes the part where I am questioning my mental health, for the past couple of months, I have been lacking motivation. I am a General Manager and work goes in chaos mode of I am not there. I am a workaholic. But these days I dread going to work. I feel like I have no energy. Nothing gives me true pleasure. I used to find happiness and joy in littlest things in life but now I just keep thinking about how insignificant I am, we all are compared to the vastness of this universe. 

My sister, who I met after years due to covid (she lives in Canada) literally cried last night over the phone and said that she feels like I have changed a lot. She said she has not heard my laughter in a long time. She said that she can feel something is not right. She described everything I am actually going through and more. I know we are pretty close but I never shared my negativity with her.

I find myself day dreaming a lot. And I don't even want the strangers here on Reddit to know what is going on in my head but I am trying my best to bare as much as I can. This morning when I was in the shower I started to cry, like really cry. Tears and snot, the whole works. The worst part is I didn't know why was I crying. After I was done I felt good for a little while then this feeling of dread came all over again. I am also dealing with insomnia. I went to see a doc and he prescribed me Valium for the insomnia. I don't trust medications but is they will help me feel better I night give them a try.

I don't know why but I am very hesitant to go to a psychiatrist. I don't want to see a shrink.

Is there any way I can find out myself if I am facing depression? If it turns out I indeed am, I might think about getting professional help.

I don't know why but I never thought it would be this hard. I don't anybody to know how I feel these days. I try to laugh as much as I can when around people so they don't see what I am struggling with. You know the feeling of you ever had a fear that the entire world is going to find out your search history? That's the kind of feeling I get but only it's not my browser search history, it's my thoughts. I feel like I no longer have any purpose to go on. No, I am not suicidal or anything but I am struggling to find motivation to be happy. It truly hit me like a ton of bricks in the shower that I might have issues. I feel like I am lost.

Sorry for the long post. But any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: I apologize for all the typos. I started to cry again for no reason and am shaking a lot while typing this",1
"okay, a bit of backstory. i’m a 17 year old boy who suffers with some mental health (runs in the family blood and i’ve shown symptoms since around age 3. i am currently diagnosed with anxiety and depression, being retested for adhd and autism because when i was younger i was told “there’s nothing wrong with me because i could sit in a chair still” me and my family think i am bipolar too because it also runs in the family and i show a lot of symptoms to it. i used to take drugs like;  mdma, cocaine and valium but i quit those a while back due to knowing they wasn’t helping with my mental health. i now mainly only smoke cannabis daily which i know can help/not help with anxiety  and depression. and now my heads stuck in the same shit different day cycle, everyday is the exact same. i wake up smoke bongs eat food smoke more bongs sometimes go over my mates house to smoke more bongs then go home to smoke bongs and go to sleep. unhealthy routine i know, but i’ve been trying to get out of it for the past year and i end up just getting to the point where i’m doing pretty good and then it all just goes back to smoking loads and my head goes back worse. but the thing is even when i have them little bits of good in my head it’s still not good. i’m not in college as my college didn’t accept me, and i’m also deemed unfit to work. all i have to live off is £240 a month and i have to pay borden lodge to my parents too. just genuinely don’t know what to do atm. my antidepressants don’t seem to be working at all and i just have no motivation for anything other than smoking weed. and i hate it.",1
"  Hi There,

I don’t want to write a long drawn out post so will try to be as succinct as possible.

My girlfriend left me 2 weeks ago because I am depressed. It’s heart-breaking but I understand. I am a professional athlete, financially secure, good job, everything all good on that end, I’m 30 years old and I know 18 year old me would be in absolute shock at the man I have become.  


However I have been dealing with depression for the last 3 years of my life. Around 3 years ago I split up with my first girlfriend, who I was madly in love with, I developed a vicious cocaine habit, having never done any drugs in my life. I was on around £200 a day habit, I lost around 15 – 20 kg, totally emancipated, I have quite a well-muscled physique and so the weight loss was very striking to my friends. Eventually this drove my friends to start an intervention, they forced me to go on holiday for 6 months to get clean and they would run my business. 3 years later I am clean and sober on the hard stuff but have developed another addiction as a form of self-medication.  
 

I take around 100 – 150 mg of Valium a day, often mixed with codeine and tramadol etc just to “quiet down” my hyperactive mind. Almost every second of my waking life is me pondering about deep philosophical questions or ruminating about past mistakes which leads to insomnia at night and depression through the day.  
 

My question is, how can you rationalize with a depressive if fundamentally they of are certain philosophical view. Lets say for example an alcoholic you can quite easily rationalize with the alcoholic, you cam explain to him the damage he is causing himself and his family and lay it out that way. Or take a gambler, you can literally show him that the casino always wins, by presenting him with simple mathematical equations that show why gambling is not a good idea long term regardless of the rush you get or the short term winnings you may of received, inevitably the house always wins and this is why bookies and casinos are open.  
 

But what if fundamentally at your core you are a nihilist, you believe everyone is selfish and you are extremely cynical. You believe life has no subjective meaning and there is no such thing as objective reality. You may say to read Nietzsche or other philosophers works, which I have done but they all draw me to the same conclusion, without a god, which I believe to be the case, then we must “MAKE UP” or own subjective meaning which is fine, I can do that, but deep down I know it to be an illusion and therefore do not take any satisfaction or happiness out of working towards my goals and aspirations in life. It's like knowing how a magic trick is performed.  
 

Surely this is a personality “curse” that cannot be cured, was this set in stone when I was born? While I do not believe it was predetermined I do believe I was positively predisposed to this kind of existential nihilism due to my neurotic personality.  
 

What are people’s views and suggestions on this? I feel like I know a lot about “shit you shouldn’t worry about” while my girlfriends wondering who’s gonna win strictly come dancing, I’m thinking about Schrodinger’s cat and string theory.  


Can CBT therapy help depressives who fundamentally have certain philosophical views they have drawn using reason and logic.  


Kind Regards",1
" hi all, i wanted to ask if this is a problem anyone else has had, and i suspect it has one of two causes. i've been in constant misery for the past few days: i've felt so anxious that my body is wired like someone who drank 7 energy drinks, i'm drinking a ton of water and peeing so often, i can't sleep (at all which is unusual), i am constantly dizzy and have a pretty bad headache, and i can't concentrate. several times i've broken down or had a panic attack, i start crying and hyperventilating and it's so hard to calm myself down. even when i do, i havent had a single moment in 2 days where i feel like my normal neutral self.

i even took a valium for the first time about 4 hours ago, zero effect. my usual PMS symptoms are insomnia, breast pain, appetite change, irritability. my period tracker says it should start tomorrow (thursday) so this is why i think its due to PMS, but it's so severe and different from usual.  maybe this is just me having a covid/PMS double whammy since i have both right now (covid for the past 6 days).

 i seriously feel like this anxiety will never end. i've gotten myself into a loop of thinking this stress will last the entire month since this is such a busy month for me. please please tell me if it is possible to:  
A. have new, severe PMS symptoms out of nowhere

B. have crippling anxiety simply due to being sick with covid",1
"Lemme just go over how my journeys before I get to where I am now (agh this sounds like melodrama but seriously)
So back I think around 5 years ago although my memories hazy could be 4 years I had a complete mental breakdown from a lot of intensely stressful situations along with a lot of stress and feeling trapped at home (if I start talking about the details I might flashback so I'm not gonna) as well as smoking 3gs of high strength weed to cope (the weed was only the start of my substance abuse though) that actually just increased my paranoia anxiety and restlessness to the point I was convinced my lungs would collapse or I'd have a heart attack and that just scratches the surface of the paranoia as well as being intensely scared of some rl problems I don't want to write about I will say somebody in my house was dealing a large amount of drugs and I was scared for everybody's safety and of the police but the rest is too kuch. I was slowly declining academically from all the stress as well, I went to a grammar that I got myself into by myself by working hard and they ended up putting an incredible amount of stress on me academically despite the fact I've always pushed myself as hard as I can with my studies as well as pretty much abusing me for having autism they just completely ruined my life there not believing a word I said constantly belittling me excluding me sometimes for no reason, completely disqualifying and devaluing my every word and issue and assigning a learning support dude to follow me round everyday everywhere which I immediately knew first day would fuck any chance of social connection and it did (I might be autistic but I'm extremely socially aware never struggled with that apart from because of this) and I didn't even need learning support or any support anyway but they never gave me a chance without it. The place was also filled with drugs and knives hence why I got into weed anyway I ended up going less and less and just felt trapped and alone at home around this time my best friend of 10 now 15 years stole over 360 quid from my mother leaving me distraught and alone (yeah I eventually forgave him he's put a lot of effort into bettering himself and gave back all the money he stole he felt he needed it at the time bcos his family wasnt doing too well) anyway all of this compounded along with the things I can't write about and one day just broke me I had the most intense panic attack I've ever had only ot didn't end I was left in a constant state of what I now now is called hypervigilance so Ithought my lungs had collapsed I went to the hospital and the dickheads didn't help me at all what they should have done was give me benzodiazipines first of all to stabilise my mental state but what they actually did is well nothing I was just sent home where I suddenly started having horrific nightmares 24/7 hypervigilance jumping at any slight noise and all the other things you get from ptsd so there I was alone with no idea how to function at all with fuck all support from the UK mental health system and nobody to talk to. After a while I found out how to buy valium on the Internet and thought that would help me but I only used it sparingly in an attempt to avoid addiction it was just like my little break from hell, then on the other days I would drink like a fish and use opiates to get some feelgood chemicals back in my system sometimes I would combine them too ugh polyaddiction while unsuccessfully trying to get my life on track while it wasn't even possible to think about what I wanted to do or anything my only goal was to get better but it never worked I also started smoking weed again and just went deeper and deeper into my hell alone unloved and suicidal while the drugs changed everything about who I was as a person at least I never had to steal but Jesus christ it was bad at my worst I was taking something like 14-16mg of xanax a day some opiates mostly dihydrocodeine of like 90mgs a day and drinking around 120 units a week god knows how I survived lol but as I say how fucked my life had become and how much pain my family were in watching this happen I decided to quit everything it was my only goal for 1 whole year of my life. First went the alcohol with 2 weeks of absolute hell I won't go into, then went the dhc that wasn't quite as hard but still awful and then finally after all the stress of quitting those 2 the xanax knolopin and valium had to go oh btw did I mention this quitting process coincided with the start of covid lol I know a lot of people had an extremely terrible time feeling lonely unconnected and depressed imagine that plus constant drug withdrawal at least I wasn't missing out on much in the world though so yeah I then had to start a 9 month long taper of benzodiazipines and Jesus christ the other withdrawal had nothing on this taper (you have to taper benzos instead of quitting straight up cos I would have died lool) at first it wasn't so bad but as it went on I got worse and worse and worse and worse it brought up everything all the emotions a bunch of aggression I was holding onto with gritted teeth making sure I didn't snap terrifying depression and just exacerbated all the ptsd stuff to the max words do not exist for the pain and paranoia and depression I was in it was traumatising me again and it destroyed me over and over and it was endless time flies when your having fun but time crawled to an absolute standstill during the taper I couldn't even watch movies or read or focus on games all I had was a vape I'd puff all day blowing smoke rings. It takes 9 months to make a bloody human in a way I guess I was born again and I never relapsed not even once I had the willpower to do absolutely anything and I held onto that through everything although I did start using codeine again at one point to deal with the anhedonia which I quit again 3 weeks later and I started smoking weed again like an idiot but eventually it all ended I'm 3 or months past the whole thing now I've learnt how to treat my ptsd a lot better (strong cbd, shrooms and a drug called venlaflaxine if ur wondering) and 2 weeks ago I finally quit smoking weed finally I'm free from all the shit I've wrote about here and all the worse stuff I can't write about here but I'm addressing it all going to college now exercising a bit enjoying things a tiny bit now and I can finally see a way to be free I'll eventually overcome it all but I just feel so empty now finding a way to overcome my mind has been my only goal for so long that this semi normality the thing I wanted it just feels empty I almost miss all the adrenaline and I don't know how I'm going to live my life without weed I don't even know what the hell to do now I don't have a future recovery was my only goal I don't have any idea what to do now why the hell is everything so empty I still feel lonely never been in relationship still got my insecurities I'm just some 20 year old idiot who missed out on having a normal teenage hood tbh all I want is the herb right now I just can't get absorbed in life sober and with manageable struggles anyone got any advice?",1
"\*\*trigger warning, mentions of self-harm, s\*\*\*\*de, and abuse\*\*\*  

I started having OCD tendencies in elementary school. I was self-harming by middle school before I even knew it was a thing other people did. My teachers wanted me checked for ADHD. I was always feeling stressed out, depressed, and often suicidal, despite having a pretty good home life. I think my first boyfriend targeted me because I was so fragile, and I ended up dating an abuser for 3 years and have since been diagnosed with PTSD on top of everything else.

My parents took me to a psychologist who provided therapy to me. After a few sessions she denied the need for me to be tested for ADHD. She was adamant that I didn't have it. She also told my parents that lots of teenagers experiment with cutting, and that it was just a phase. Otherwise I was a normal healthy kid. I got some help with managing my OCD tendencies, since they were getting in the way of school (I was writing and re-writing all of my school assignments. Homework took hours. It was miserable). Eventually I told my parents I didn't want to see her again, since I was obviously fine, and the therapist and my parents agreed.

I dropped out of the degree program I wanted. It was the only job I ever wanted, since 4th grade when I found out the job existed, but it requires all the way through a doctorate. I just couldn't keep up with the demands, and I went with an easier college track. I made my first suicide attempt about a year into my first post graduate job. I dropped out of work completely for a couple years after another hospital stay and attempt, and then trying to figure out medication management, which basically had me comatose for the better part of a year.

All this time. ALL THIS FUCKING TIME I have struggled with bipolar disorder, OCD, and ADHD, all very common comorbidities. I was diagnosed bipolar about 5 years ago, but only now, at 34, I found out for sure that I'm ADHD. I'm on new medication. I can think. Oh my God I can follow directions! Oh my God my hands don't shake when I'm on the ADHD medication. My shaky hands were one reason I dropped out of the science program, since it required lots of dissecting things, and I physically couldn't do it. I stopped doing anything artistic because of it. 

My mom feels a lot of guilt over this. She says ""I had no idea, I wish I had done something differently."" But my parents *did* consult with a professional and they went by what the professional said. I don't blame them at all, I just wish I had been more open with them about my feelings, because before they found out I was self-harming, they never suspected that I was unhappy. I continued to lie and pretend I was happy. My grades were great once I got the OCD stuff under control, and I even graduated salutatorian of my class so I looked like the perfect kid, but school was really a struggle, and I felt like I had to study 10x what my competitors did to stay on top of my class.

Now I feel a lot of ""if only."" If I had gotten my bipolar symptoms and ADHD under control before college, maybe I'd now have that dream job I wanted my whole life. Maybe I'd have a lot more money. Maybe I wouldn't have been so manipulatable by an abusive asshole, and I wouldn't wake up with panic attacks because I dreamt about him again. Or jump at the slightest noise or shake so much at the dentist's office that they have to give me valium to be able to perform the smallest of procedures. Maybe I wouldn't have broken out in tears when I realized my dog's new vet is a man and I thought I might end up alone in a room with him. Maybe I wouldn't have ended up putting my husband through two suicide attempts, and then having him bear the burden of the bills for a couple years. If only...",1
Recently I’ve been having these panic attacks where I start losing feeling in my face. It starts in my lips and they kinda curl in and I can’t speak and it spreads out to my whole face and then I curl up in a ball and I’m almost paralyzed. Its really scary and I know why I’m having the attacks they aren’t random or anything. I’ve had panic attacks before but mostly I’d black out and kinda just fall down and hyperventilate and then I’d be ok but this numbness is relatively new. Does this happen to anyone else? How do you deal with it? Also I do plan to tell my doctor I am just in a transition between doctors. I recently retired from the Air Force so I had to leave my old psychiatrist and I will be seeing the VA and I would also like to see a new psychiatrist as well. ,1

It's been two days since I've taken any of the following (or slept), so please forgive any errs.

Lexapro, Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Clonidine, Trazadone, Wellbutrin, Namenda, Nuvigil, Mydayis and Suboxone.

Short version: 2 months ago my long time psyche doc decided to focus entirely on coronavirus related (psychiatric) symptoms. He said, here's a month's supply of your 10 medications, go find a new doc. I recently changed jobs with downgraded insurance, and so began to make calls to the narrower field of folks in my new network. As you may have guessed, with the terrifying uptick of pandemic / election related mental illness, psychiatrists taking on new patients are few and far between, especially in my heavily infected state.

As my supplies dwindled, I grew desperate and rang my old PCP to see if she could help. She didn't even have time to see me, but got me in with her PA who saw me face to face, and bless his heart, prescribed the Lexapro cause he's a good fucking guy. I've been in touch with my old doc throughout, and his last text from this afternoon in response to my asking what to do reads - ""I don't know. I think people go to an urgent care center"". Not wanting to risk my life or that of my wife without merit, I replied ""I can be at one in 10 minutes. To confirm, they'll be able to contact you to confirm the history, and write these prescriptions?"". Then nada.

I'm totally up for advice as my entire body is tensing like one gargantuan monkey's fist. My withdrawal experience includes valium, synthetic cannabinoids (yea it was a thing), methamphetamine and heroin. But I was never expected to hold down a corp job while doing so, nor endure all at once. There's no end in sight, and forgive the dramatic bravado but I'm scared shitless. Like, it's leaking out of me (where my subs at?). Also, I do not have the funds to purchase , most or all of these from dark web vendors, or pay ER prices (repeatedly).

Thanks in advance for words of wisdom. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. And if you hear about an MA state resident ramming his Impala into the side of a CVS pharmacy before bounding over the wreckage to walk away with just one month's supply of each aforementioned medication, well, I might know a guy.

It’s worse now. 
Now that I’m not crying every day or even every week it gets so much worse when I do. I’ve had 2 pretty major panic episodes over the last week. One day it was like 5 straight hrs of feeling like I was some sort of electrical conduit. It felt like my skin was almost fluttering on my wrists and forearms then up to my shoulders, like it had wings and was going to just lift off of my body at any moment. That was a new experience... and when I finally figured out what the trigger was which was so so stupid btw, it was 3 am and I felt like an idiot. A tired idiot. I mean I could’ve taken a Valium but I’ve needed to take them more than before because the panic gets really bad. I mean to the point that it’s 2 am and I’m still pacing and I just took 20 mgs to make me sit down.





It’s fucked up dude, I get so stuck in my head I can’t leave the house. All my clocks are set 20 mins fast just so I can make it somewhere on time.





I am and am not okay both at the same time. It makes no fucking sense.





It feels like a war inside again. It hasn’t been this bad in a really long time.






I’m sensitive, always have been but this is weird. Some days I’m fucking concrete, other days I’m lost at sea... I have my fuckin dumb broad moments as any female does but I do try to rein it in and after I see I’ve been an ass I’m gonna apologize. Even with D****, and I flat told him I don’t wanna even talk about getting back together but I said some shitty things to him when we were fighting so when I cooled down I apologized. He apologized too, and I’m sure he has some idea that he’ll win me back or whatever the fuck when he gets back from T*** in a couple of weeks but tbh that ship has sailed. Fool me twice ya know. And over something as trivial as a damn video game. Fuck your PlayStation and get out of my face then.





I almost had my sleep schedule switched back to days and then D**** and I had our bs and broke up again and Idk between that and the dreams about Alecia and just... life before, ya know, life - dude I haven’t been to some of the places on my family’s property that I’ve seen in my recent dreams in 20 or more years. Some of the structures aren’t even standing anymore. Like B****’s place is completely different now, there was a shed right on his side of the property that we’d sit in and smoke cigs and bullshit in back in high school.

[The shed] it’s gone now. I looked for it the day of her funeral.





And the panic is like it’s own little monster inside my stomach and chest. It sits mostly, sometimes it moves a little. But when I’m in that panic/fight or flight mode it takes twice as much whiskey or meds whichever way I go. Daytime meds don’t change unless I taper down, I don’t have any days that I take more than 10 and for at least a solid week this month I tapered down from 10mg a day to 2.5 just to give myself a break. It sucks balls because when I don’t take the full dose it’s very apparent and my symptoms get really hard to manage. That’s when I get stuck really hard and end up pacing all night. If I take the 10mgs a day like I’m supposed to it mostly levels everything out with the occasional hypersensitivity that comes anytime I’m reminded of her. 





But the restlessness is the hardest thing... it feels like I have to keep moving but have nowhere to go. 





I don’t like violence.
Like you have to make me furious and hurt my heart at the same time for me to want to actually hit someone and I’m guarded enough that most people don’t ever get close enough to even touch the emotions required for all that. When we were kids, when people asked me why I never hit back I never could explain it but looking back it’s easy. Every time I actually got that synergistic combination of just the right amount of angry and sad, my fear of hurting someone would kick in and then I wasn’t mad anymore, just hurt. So then it was like I almost couldn’t hit them. Like my gut wouldn’t let me do it. Even further, I felt really bad afterwards for two polar opposite reasons: 1. I felt guilty for being mean or in my perception “causing “ the fight even if I had tried to avoid it at all costs. (I didn’t always, once I talked some shit back pretty hard so that one I knew I had coming, I was just already in too deep to shut my mouth - probably protecting someone that was usually a prime reason for me to talk shit 🤷🏼‍♀️) This would lead to more self-doubt because I couldn’t identify what I was doing to make myself a target. And 2: I felt guilty because I knew when I got home I would have to explain to my bio Mom why I didn’t hit the girl back. I also felt weak for not being able to bring myself to defend myself physically when I probably should have. Sometimes I wonder if that’s even normal. If not, what happened to me to make me that way? 

Am I defective? 😂






It’s the mental/emotional ties that get me the most, I think. I don’t connect like other people do. I don’t know why. I just know, somehow, I don’t fit. 

Maybe there just isn’t room for me. 

I used to be more social and wanted to be friendlier, now I’m just friendly enough to be polite enough to make my exit. Like I think I want to connect for a hot minute but then I start to see the bs like with D****. He didn’t really do anything that bad, not like betrayal level. No cheating, never put hands on me, but the second the video games became an issue - as in I’m calling your name enough times - I was just getting out of the shower and needed a towel - from a wall away with an open door after you just told me to enjoy my shower and call you when I need a towel, that I finally get pissed off and go get it my damn self - 
I realized I was settling and cold feet doesn’t even begin to cover it, that shit was frost bitten.





And this time I don’t even feel guilty about it [leaving him]. That’s what always made me go back to abusive ass people. That and abandonment, I’m pretty sure I have this deep rooted subconscious belief that I’m incapable of being loved by another person because I’m such a dickbag. A lovable dickbag, but a bag of dicks nonetheless. I annoy the fuck out of myself. I can’t imagine I’m very much more tolerable for other people. 🤷🏼‍♀️
I think as I get older I’m starting to notice a little bit more of my Grandpa in me. Like don’t hate the player, hate the game. If y’all didn’t be fucking around with my emotions my soft ass wouldn’t be like this and now I’m just a tiny bit more comfortable with just being the asshole when it’s called for instead of holding it all back and cowering like I’m scared to speak up until it’s pent up and blows like a damn volcano. No fucking chill dude. None. But hey, if a little slip of brutal honesty in the moment is what it takes to keep me in the moment and out of my head it’s better than a few alternatives I can think of.





Almost 3:30 again, still can’t quite sleep. Tired. Exhausted. But still so many thoughts. So many things to figure out. Is it like this for everyone or just me? 





The spacing on my notes bothers me if it isn’t exact. I feel like I have to go back and check every so often just to make sure it’s right or it doesn’t “feel right”. 




Finally feel like I can fall asleep. 3:38 AM

*2nd dose of Adderall @ 12:30 PM* No Valium in 2 days.",1
"Hello everyone, this is my first post on here and I hope it’s relevant.

I was stalked and raped violently 6 years ago causing obvious trauma and a diagnosis of ptsd. After a couple years of partying the pain away I started having bad anxiety attacks. I was prescribed Zoloft and saw a therapist steadily which really helped for a couple more years until very recently some other terrible things involving family happened and I can only assume triggered my anxiety to a whole other level. My GP prescribed me trazodone for my nightmares.

Fast forward a couple months and anxiety attacks here and there, I went to the ER one night thinking I was having a seizure but was simply given a Valium (which worked amazingly) and was told I had an anxiety attack. This one was just bigger and more horrible than before, maybe because it was so bad it outdid my years of Zoloft use? Idk, Anyway... I had since been having vicious panic attacks at least 4 days a week and it is ruining my work and social life.

I went to my GP and told her what happened in the ER and my daily debilitation and straight up asked for something “as needed” while me and my therapist worked out some more knots in my head and heart. She prescribed me Buspirone and upped my Zoloft.

It’s been a couple days and I had a terrible anxiety attack that i took the Buspirone for but had no relief. Which obviously made things worse for the attack and am now here on reddit 4 am in the west coast pretty desperate for advice.

I never wanted to be on any daily medication in the first place. I’m a very attracted to nature and things of authenticity but with ptsd things aren’t the way I wish, which I accept. My therapist (who I adore and owe my life, honestly) thinks I don’t need medication and has always thought so but is only a psychologist so can’t really weigh in too much on that.

All my GP seems to do is put me on more and more medication that makes me feel concerned for my actual healing; how am I supposed to heal my soul and heal naturally through therapy while I’m doped up the whole time? I know she means no harm but I believe we have different ideas of my mental health journey. So I want to ween off everything I’m on and simply have a TRUE as needed medication that can kill the attacks while I work things out authentically with my therapist... like instead of trimming my issues slightly everyday by taking chemical reactors, I want to remove the skin altogether that keeps me so jailed. 

I want to get a second opinion with another doctor and have a few questions:

1) should I see another GP or go straight to a psychiatrist?

2) what as needed medication is best for massive anxiety attacks?

3) am I totally out of touch and should just trust my current GP?

4) is it appropriate to straight up ask for a benzo or should I just tell my story and wishes without specific demands? Will i sound like a druggie???

I know this is a lot and bless your soul for reading it all. I’m so desperate I sometimes feel my life is on the line when really I just want to LIVE. 
Thank you!

"Found out today that Valium medication is an opioid. That's one reason my doctor can't prescribe it. I told my doctor, my great grandmother took it & didn't die from it. So I doubt if I will. She still wouldn't give it to me.🤦 And the government wonders why the US has a mental health crisis.🤦 #anxietysucks",1
I have been out of Zoloft for a few days and I can’t get a refill for a few more. I’m home alone and starting to get really bad anxiety that’s making me cry and be paranoid. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to help w this? ,1
"I've gone to two walk in doctors to try to get some anti anxiety meds. I've mentioned Ativan, because I hear it's the easiest one to get since it apparently doesn't have the same history of abuse like Valium and Xanax, and apparently it's not quite as strong as those either. 

The first doctor I saw just laughed at me for even asking, but before sending me on my way he suggested I take some antidepressants, and gave me a list of ones to consider, and told me to come back once I've decided on one that I felt the most comfortable with. Of course I left and didn't come back...

The second doctor I saw seemed more sympathetic, and asked me more questions. I didn't mention Ativan, because I was laughed at the previous time, and I didn't want to just come off looking like I just wanted drugs, cuz I didn't want them to think I just want to abuse them. Instead I just used the term ""anxiety meds"". He ended up referring me to a mental health clinic, and gave me a prescription for Escitalopram (aka Lexapro, Cipralex). I threw the prescription out, because I don't want to be on antidepressants. 

I was under the impression I was going to be sent to a psychiatrist, but apparently I just ended up seeing a counselor at the mental health clinic. I've seen him several times now, and it basically has just felt like a waste of time. The only reason I've continued to see him is because he set me up to see a psychiatrist through the clinic. I saw that psychiatrist today finally, and talked about a whole lot of stuff, first focusing on my anxiety, then delving into my personal life and upbringing. Although I feel like I was very clear about my anxiety, I feel like I kinda hit a wall with him, because he seemed to think that drugs weren't the best thing for me, at least not benzos. He seemed like the kind of psychiatrist who is very careful with prescribing drugs, but he still thought it wasn't that bad of an idea to represcribe me Escitalopram. I feel like he was concerned that I was going to be using Ativan too much, even though I made it clear that I don't get anxiety attacks that often, like once or twice a month, maybe even less; however, they are horrible and can go on for hours, so I wanted something so that I don't have to experience and anxiety attack anymore. I made it clear that most of my anxiety is social anxiety, and I made it clear that I can deal with most of it, even though I don't like it, but there are situations like making important phone calls, or job interviews etc. where my anxiety it too strong, that I usually just avoid those situations, thus don't get ahead in life. So seeing as I'm not in those situations on a daily basis, and often not even on a weekly basis, there shouldn't be concern for me overusing them and getting addicted. I feel like he somehow thought that I have more General Anxiety that's quite constant, but I don't. For the most part I'm quite relaxed on my own or with friends, and even though I feel a little anxious going shopping or working, I can tolerate that anxiety, and wouldn't consider popping an Ativan in those situations. I was super clear about the frequency of my anxiety, and what situations I feel like I could benefit from a benzo, and how I feel like many situations I could manage the anxiety without anything.

Anyways, that psychiatrist was apparently just a one and done type thing. Apparently I most likely won't seem him again, and quite frankly, I don't really want to. Felt like a waste of time. He got to know very personal things about me, things even my family doesn't know, and although he seemed sympathetic, I don't think he actually understood my anxiety in that short session. Apparently he and my counselor seem to think I'm doing great just because I'm currently working; however, it's just a seasonal job that I've been working for the past 3 years, and my anxiety prevents my from finding work in the off season, thus I'm not moving forward in my life. I don't think this is acceptable for a 25 year old male, and it blows my mind they think I should be proud of that. Sure it beats not working at all, but it's hardly something to be proud of.

Another thing I gathered from the meeting was that girls tend to acquire benzos more easily than men. They didn't admit to being sexist or anything, but when I mentioned that I know numerous girls who take Ativan, and one who takes Klonopin, and all they did was see a random doctor, and yet I've gone through all these hoops and still can't get Ativan. I also mentioned that I've read on this subreddit about how people have gotten benzos quite easily. They admitted that men tend to have a harder time, because it is assumed they're more likely to abuse a drug. I  couldn't believe it when they said it. It was so damn sexist, but being my quiet anxious self, I didn't speak up about how ridiculous that sounded.

Anyways, I feel like I'm back at square one... Apparently the psychiatrist will send records of my visit with him to my family doctor. He said I could see him and ask about Ativan. He did say he wasn't going to recommend it in the letter; however, he wasn't going to discourage it either. He figured it should be totally up to my family doctor... I don't know if it's even worth it, because I feel like it's gonna be the same bullshit all over again, and I'll probably leave with another prescription for antidepressants. 

Now that you know my story, and I thank all of you who read it all, or at least read enough to understand my situation, do any of you have tips on how to get a benzo prescribed to you. Also are there any other young men out there who have struggled to get a benzo like me? Has anyone else noticed the sexism? or is this just my own personal experience? 

My counselor claims that you can't just anticipate an anxious situation and pop an ativan, and that it's only to stop an attack once it starts... that doesn't really make sense to me, and the people I know who have Ativan say that they've taken it before job interviews before and it takes most if not all the edge off. They also told me that it's bullshit when a doctor tells you that you can't function properly on them, because many people can apparently get away with a pretty low dose that gets rid of the anxiety without making you feel super sleepy and useless. I understand you're not supposed to use a motorized vehicle even if you feel like you could do it, the people I know who use Ativan from time to time have taken it at work before, and have been able to do their job just fine. Do any of you feel like you can take a benzo ahead of time when you know you're going into a situation that causes anxiety attacks, and it works for you? 

I don't get random anxiety attacks much anymore, and even when they were frequent, it was only like several times a month, but now it's like once or twice a month at the most, but i can often go months without them. if i'm put into certain situations that cause strong anxiety i can still have an attack though, but most of my daily anxiety is manageable, and i don't need pills for it. i just want pills as a back up for those times i have attacks, cuz they're fucking awful, and i don't want to experience them anymore.

"Sorry in advance the long post.

For 17 years I have had, alongside anxiety and depression, a condition where I feel/will be sick at night. There is nothing gastric that triggers it as far as we can tell, I've been to the GP many times and had lots of tests plus it strikes when it gets dark regardless of what I've eaten or drunk that day. Even if I haven't eaten. It doesn't strike every night but when it does it hits hard and the fear of it coming back makes it come back. The length of time the fear keeps it going is getting longer and longer. The feeling is like having a sickness virus, the kind that keeps you feeling like you need to be sick and/or being sick even if there's nothing left in you including bile. It's completely mental and my mind does all of this to itself but I don't know how to stop it. The best analogy I have is that it's like years ago there was a fire and while the fire was put out years ago the fire alarm is still ringing. It used to be that I could take a couple of valium (or diazepam) and that would get me through the attack and the night but now even 15ml of valium will make me sleepy but every time I drop off the sickness and panic will jolt me awake, it used to stop as soon as the sun rose now it bleeds into the day (especially this time of year) and keeps me feeling sick all day.

Distractions that used to help can't punch through the panic anymore and an attack now means that I can't sleep or eat properly if at all for as long as it keeps up. It has been getting steadily worse and I am now in a place where one attack of the sickness will keep it coming back for weeks. I am awake all night feeling like I want to be sick (by the way being sick provides no relief), trying not to be and wanting to die. I had an attack before Christmas, spent weeks sleeping on the sofa so I can distract myself with films all night and was just getting back to a point where I thought I could sleep in my own bed again. Then I had another attack two days ago and I'm back to feeling sick all the time and now, because of how much of a state I get in, needing someone to be with me all night. I honestly don't know how much longer I can do this and I am desperate. I know it must sound melodramatic but I don't want to be alive anymore. Sleeping tablets don't keep me asleep, anti-sickness tablets do nothing, none of the antidepressants I have tried have helped. The only thing that helps is smoking weed which isn't legal where I live so all I can get is whatever my dealer has in... and she only ever seems to have the stuff that peps you up, not great for anxiety and certainly not good for trying to sleep. I currently only have the awful stuff that was all my dealer had (we think it was harvested too early as all it really does is make you cough like hell which isn't too handy when you're trying not to retch) and I'm nearly out of even that.

I'm looking for any advice. Have any of you had or know someone who has had something similar? How do/did they deal with it and if they got over it then please tell me how. Please help if you can. Thank you.",1
"I hope that it’s ok to post this here. If not I’d be really grateful if you could direct me somewhere else.

I have a friend* Laura (not really Laura) who was ‘involuntarily admitted’ to a psychiatric ward sometime towards the end of last week during/after what I can only assume was a psychotic episode. I don’t know what the immediate trigger was (if there is such a thing), or what events took place to end up with her in there.

Nevertheless I have been in touch with her, and for the first time today she sounded more herself on text, so I offered to pop in and see her, which I did. It was great to see her, and I have to say she’s looking as well as can be expected. There was a certain amount of weariness in her eyes, and she certainly doesn’t seem to be massively stimulated by the activities in there, but on the other hand I gather she’s on fairly industrial quantities of Valium, so I guess that she won’t be too active.

What I’d like to ask is for any tips that you might have for me to be a good friend to her for the (as yet undefined) period she’s in hospital, and for once she is released. I took her in some snacks, chocolate and a magazine, but anything outside of that that you can think of that I can get would be wonderful.

Likewise, if there is anything I can do to ‘help’ with her care - I don’t mean in the clinical sense, but just in the sense of helping her to know that she is cared for, and that she has friends who are and will be rooting for her.

(Forgive me if the next bit comes off too strong - I know what I mean to say but I’m having trouble wording it!) Please note that I’m not really interested in a ‘diagnosis’ - I don’t really care if she’s suffering from psychosis or raging pink elephant syndrome. Unless it’s relevant that I know, I’m happy enough for her to tell me or not tell me at her leisure. For that reason I’d appreciate it if you could refrain from speculating on a diagnosis in your replies.

So, that’s it really. Any top tips?

(*) I left this bit to the end coz I’m trying not to make it about me, but this might be relevant. Laura isn’t ‘just’ a friend, but my ex. We split on good terms about 6 months ago, but have been in regular contact ever since, and I consider her a great friend. Where that might be a concern is that, from what I can piece together from texts, our relationship (both past and present) featured somehow in her episode. There was a particular text that she seemed to be reaching out for us to get back together. But, at the same time, I think that she feels part of a ‘conspiracy’ of some sort, whereby someone (maybe a group?) is trying to manipulate her, particularly through the Internet, computers and tv. I believe she also feels I might be a part of the conspiracy, and might in some way be trying to manipulate her myself. She said something today to the effect that she’s ‘not sure what my (as in me, not her) part in all this is’ and that I’m ‘difficult to read’. Please believe me when I say I’m not part of a conspiracy! Please also believe that, whilst I will admit that I have feelings for her and would be happy to get back together, I do understand that now is not the time to be thinking of that - indeed the time may never be right. Nevertheless, I do want to be a good friend, if that’s possible.

So, having said that, does the advice change at all? Should I engage with the idea of the conspiracy? Honestly, I think I’d find it very hard to provide any evidence that would help to PROVE I’m not trying to manipulate her, but if I can give her reassurance I would love to. Or, equally, should I try not to engage?

Many thanks in anticipation of any replies. Take care.",1
"I don't know how to live with myself, i just expect y'all to drill me as a terrible shit person and that is okay, i am not a good man and i should probably be hung for being born with such a difficult disability (Mild intellectual disability) that makes no one understand the motives behind my coping mechanisms.

After missing about 3 appointments in the past (few years ago), i finally felt motivated to get myself back into the system through a doctor's referral, what motivated me to get back in was that i was in a mental crisis at that time. I over a month ago had 2 appointments which i attended and the 3rd which was over the phone as the Covid crisis grew, i had my 4th scheduled which was really my (7th) if you include the missed appointments from a few years ago. I missed that one last week and my therapist has called me 2 times and i have not answered the phone. I slipped into another mood where i just go ghost for no reason, merely because i felt misunderstood and because i feel shame, i also feel like no one will be able to treat me and so these things just make me ghost or push people away.

Over a week ago i called the emergency as i was thinking of killing myself after a horrific 7-day OCD episode, a specialist talked to me for an hour and i felt fine again.

It is very crucial that i commit to therapy to make sure i learn to cope with my OCD, i'm on meds for my OCD which have been lifesaving for the past 3 years but over the course of  the last few months i feel they are pooping out and i am slipping into bad obsessive episodes more frequently as opposed to rarely. It's also very difficult to treat me because i also have BPD with NPD traits.

I again feel as if i let others down, as if i mess everything up, it does not help when my doctor shakes his head in a joking but smug way and is a upper class posh narcissist., i feel like a burden talking to him, because i have visited him so frequently, he has become so sick of me and my shit. He contributes to my shame as well. I feel because of my disability no one will ever understand me and i feel i have been failed by the healtcare system, i feel failed that no one takes my disability into account for my communication issues and commitment. What do i do? continue suffering or own up to my therapist and pity myself again? something is not right here and it is clear that nothing is working for me besides meds. Last night i took like 2 pills of Valium which helped ease my obsession for an hour before flaring up again",1
"My dad is single, 75 years old and lives alone. He has been single since he and my mom divorced when I was in 4th grade. He has struggled with social anxiety his whole adult life. My mom has told me he used to take valium back in the 70's. In the late 80's, he discovered Xanax which he said helped him function in the workplace better than he ever had. (He says it helped him get quality sleep and helped his brain work better during the day.) Consequently he excelled in his trust investments job at a bank in Memphis. 

He is an introvert. He likes to talk to people about serious topics. He's not a fan of small talk or parties. He also has a preoccupation with race topics. He says this world will be a 3rd world country in a few years because of political correctness and the US's policies on racial equality. (He thinks we'd all be better off if the Nazis had won. My sister and I don't share his views, by the way.)  

Over the years, my dad has dated off and on but never remarried. He has had friends over the years, but almost always finds faults with people that make him decide to put distance between himself and them. Some of it is because he likes to be alone more than average people do and part of it is because he finds out his friends don't share his radical views. He's been on a quest all of his life for that ""perfect"" friend or ""perfect girlfriend"" and never finds them. He has thought for years that his identification with white separatist movements would help him find people that think like he does but that hasn't happened.  Now he says he's ""disappointed"" with society to the point where he sees no reason to keep living.

For years, he has been telling me and my sister things like, ""Society has brainwashed everyone into thinking it's a good idea for everyone to live as long a life as possible, but all that happens is families spend their life savings keeping someone alive and the older person has no quality of life"" or ""I don't plan to live past 80. I wish I could just call Dr. Kavorkian when I'm ready."" I kind of thought he was all talk, but not he's informed me that he has made all the arrangements and he plans to shoot himself in early June!!!!

He's never been diagnosed with depression and says he's not depressed right now. My sister and I aren't so sure. About 3 weeks ago, he informed me and my husband that he plans to ""take himself out"" this summer. He's 75 and has no major health problems. He told us if he had a wife depending on him or friends he enjoyed, he'd stick around, but that he's grown bored with his life and doesn't want to wait around to get sick or have a stoke. (I know this is a control issue. He knows he wouldn't be in control of when he lives or dies if he had to depend on care givers.) 

Of course we were shocked, even though he says he doesn't know why, since he's been preparing us for years. We have offered to help him. We suggested he move near us, that we visit more, that he visit us more, that we talk more, that he go to the doctor and try an antidepressant....on and on. He wants to hear none of it. He's been getting his affairs in order and keeps reminding me of things like where certain things are or what to do with certain accounts. He also has a list of instructions for me to follow after he's gone. I feel guilty when I listen to his plans and told him that.  He said he understands, but has to tell me because I will need to take care of things when he's gone. I know this is so messed up. I told him that.  He just goes back to the ""society (including me) is brainwashed to think this (suicide) is a bad thing.""

I wish he had never told me. My sister and I wonder if there is anything medically we can force him to do (i.e. see a doctor, take medicine, or see a therapist). I've already called the police in the town where he lives.  They referred me to a minister.  I talked to the minister who said he would be happy to talk with me dad.  I told him that it might (?) not be safe to go to his house but that I would try to find a way to tell my dad I've found someone who would like to talk to him. (My dad is not a Christian... I brought up the ""idea"" of talking to a minister and he said, ""No, I'm not doing that."")

I'd appreciate your opinion on this.  (Also, I have an appt with a therapist on Monday.)  Ugh... I know this is so messed up!",1
"I’m just venting here and anyone else who would like to vent about this feel free to. 

I was born in a very rural little forest town in Australia. My mum was really naïve and young when she had me, and my dad was older and incredibly abusive. He was a drug dealer and a bully, he openly used drugs, beat and raped my mum in front of me when I was a baby. She left him when I was 3. I don’t remember any of it honestly, but I feel like I have always been affected by it. I had night terrors constantly as a baby. My very first memories consisted of me being stressed out and worried, I was an extremely anxious kid. Like, I was so scared of asking the teacher to go to the toilet, I would hold it until I physically couldn’t and wet myself. I was terrified of ever speaking up or talking to people. 

After my mum left my dad, we moved to the city, and life kind of got worse. My mum didn’t know how to cope with the trauma of all the abuse, so she became a heavy drug addict and alcoholic. She was emotionally unavailable and really neglected me. I was always the weird poor kid in school, too frightened to talk much, and wore shitty old clothes. It wasn’t long until I started being sexually abused by an older relative as well. My mum used to send me to be looked after while she went on benders, and that relative would take advantage of me. Not long after this, when I was about 8, I started self harming for the first time. I used to try and cut my wrists with scissors and pieces of broken glass. When I was 11 I tried to commit suicide for the first time, I found a stash of valium and took it all. I got scared and told my mum, and she sent me to my room to sleep it off. 

I had a lot on my plate when I was a child. I took responsibility for a lot of the things that went on in my life, I don’t know why, but I felt like a lot of it was my fault. I never really got to experience being carefree, having a whole family, or having nothing to worry about. I can’t look at pictures of myself as a child without becoming overwhelmed and saddened. I feel a sense of grief for that little kid I was, who was always on edge and never really got to be a kid. 

I don’t really dwell on it or resent anyone anymore, I know there’s nothing I can do to change the past. I have made a decent life for myself now as an adult. But there are things in my life right now that are missing because of my upbringing. I’m incapable of building friendships, I don’t have much trust for anyone, I’m not a very fun person honestly. I don’t enjoy partying or going out, I always begin to worry and stress out. But I’m managing through it. I just wish I could have experienced being a kid. 

Thanks for reading this far and I hope anyone who has similar experiences to mine can heal and lead a happy and healthy life from now on.",1
"Hey mental health community,

posting today looking for some advice from those who suffer from anxiety and/or panic disorders. I have had anxiety, depression, and panic attacks since childhood due to neglect as a child and was untreated until I went to college. Now a senior in college, I have seen 3 therapists and finally found one I like and have had great results with that. Therapy alone is not enough to help my anxiety and panic attacks, although it does help, the panic attacks are back in full effect. Almost everyday I practice journaling, meditation, exercise, and other activities to help my mental help this is also not enough to relieve all my symptoms, especially the panic attacks. For awhile my general practitioner prescribed me Prozac and that did help take the edge off the intrusive, negative thoughts, and the depression, but had no effect on the panic attacks. After about a year and 6 months and a few dose increases, the Prozac seemed to no longer be working at all. He referred me to psychiatrist, who prescribed me Mirtazapine and Venlafaxine. I used both as prescribed for 6 months consistently, but hated the way Venlafaxine changed my personality into a mean, angry person. I decided to stop taking it and I have no regrets. Recently I injured my shoulder very badly and had to go to the ER, and part of the treatment I was given was 3 pills of 5mg of Valium to take home. My parents are both addicts so I have never, ever wanted to take opioids or anything that makes me ""whoozy"". I have only being taking them when necessary for pain and even then I split the 5mg pill in half because I am afraid of addiction. But I have to say... my anxiety has not felt more under control in years. I took only half that pill when the pain was unbearable and while simultaneously having a panic attack(as a result of the pain), and within 20 mins all my symptoms stopped. I don't want to grow up to be a drug addict like my parents, but I wonder if benzos could be the right medication for me to take when I am having a panic attack. The pill allowed me to go about my day, stop crying, go to work, have no intrusive thoughts. It made what would have been a horrible day into a day where I could enjoy my life. Should I talk to my psychiatrist about trying benzos for my panic attacks and anxiety? Or is the risk of addiction too much? I would love to know anyone's thoughts/experiences:)",1
"* Age: 26
* Sex: M
* Height: 175cm
* Weight: 70kg
* Race: White
* Duration of complaint: Complicated, see below
* Location (Geographic and on body): Europe
* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): Vague symptoms (derealization, feeling like there's something stuck in my head, dissociative symptoms. These issues started about 2 years ago and doctors still have no idea what the issue could be. All kind of medical tests (MRI, CT, SPECT, normal EEG, long (24h) EEG) do not show anything abnormal.
* Current medications (if any): Clonazepam (0.5-1mg per day)
* Include a photo if relevant (skin condition for example): Irrelevant

A little background: as explained above, I've been having vague mental issues for about 2 years. I've done many tests, tried all sorts of medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti-epileptics,..) and seen many doctors (mainly neurologists), but so far a diagnosis could not be made. The doctors have no idea what's wrong with me and we arrived at a point where they tell me ""you'll have to learn to live with it"".

When the systoms started, I had been taking alprazolam sporadically (about 3-4 times per week) as I had these prescribed for a severe depression I had years before. I was still taking this medicine to calm down myself at times I felt it was needed.

At a certain point (around 2 years ago when the problems started), I found out alprazolam relieves my symptoms temporarily. I started taking it daily. Until this day, I have been taking 0.5mg-1mg alprazolam (xanax) on a daily basis. The doctors I've seen are not really in favor of it, but generally tell me they don't mind if this is the only thing that helps me getting through the day, as long as I don't start taking more because of tolerance. Although I have some tolerance against alprazolam, I can still feel it and it still gives me some relief. Because the psychiatrist suspected it might be a neurological problem, he switched me to clonazepam (0.5-1mg per day) a few months ago. Honestly, I feel no difference between clonazepam and alprazolam, so I've continued taking this.

I would like to stop taking benzo's. I have been thinking (parts of) my symptoms are actually withdrawal symtoms and I managed to live without benzo's on a daily basis before. I've discussed this with my psychiatrist and he told me it's up to me. I discussed a tapering method, but he said it's complete nonsense to taper off if all I'm taking is 0.5-1mg alprazolam/clonazepam per day.

So I've tried what he said and stopped cold turkey. He's what happened:

* Day 1: hard to concentrate, symptoms getting worse through the day. No relief from clonazepam this time. Falling asleep was hard, but I managed.
* Day 2: Symptoms much more severe, craving for clonazepam. I managed, but falling asleep wasn't possible anymore. I literally didn't sleep for a single minute.
* Day 3: Very tired, but still not possible to fall asleep even though I've been awake for over 24 hours. Symptoms less severe, but likely because of the tiredness. Muscle spasms starting to appear which only got worse over the day, flu-like symptoms appear. Again not being able to sleep: second night with no sleep.
* Day 4: I've been awake for 48 hours now without sleep. Very very tired, but no matter how much I try, falling asleep isn't possible. My body feels tired, but my brains feels like it's still active. I feel very ill now, needed to puke as well. I see things moving, even though I know it's not real. I think I'm starting to hallucinate, never before I experienced something like this.

At this point, I gave up. I took 1mg clonazepam and 30 minutes later I fell asleep for a long time. After I woke up, the flu-like symtoms were gone. Everything was back to normal.

Well, that's it for ""tapering isn't needed"". Honestly, I don't feel very comfortable with this psychiatrist, but I'm not able to find another one. I've done a lot of calls for an appointment outside business hours and the first available slot is Q4 2020 (not a typo). When I dropped my ""outside business hours"" demand, the first possible appointment became Q1 2020. I've actually waited this long to see a psychiatrist for a second opinion a few months ago and this second psychiatrist didn't even let me explain why I was there: he told me I belong in a mental institution (right at the start of the conversation, without ever seeing me) and shouldn't be seeking other therapists. He told me to return to the other psychiatrist and when I explained I waited half a year for this appointment to get another opinion, he literally said ""I just told you my opinion: Get yourself hospitalised inside a psychiatrist ward. I refuse to discuss this any further with you. Now get out."" The guy was a real douchebag. The reason I can get faster appointments with the my regular psychiatrist is because he limits his appointments to 20 minutes (constantly looking at the clock) and charges about 4 times the normal rate.

I feel stuck and I want to taper off benzo's, but the only psychiatrist I can see tells me tapering isn't needed and I'm overreacting when I explain the withrawal. I've seen some neurologists as well, but that was only for the medical tests, so these were 1-time appointments. The normal family doctor I see here (like a GP in the UK) tries to help me as much as she can, but also honestly tells me she doens't have any knowledge about benzo's and withdrawal and I need to see a psychiatrist for that. I asked if I could switch to diazepam (valium) and taper off slowly as this is recommended everywhere, but she doesn't really feel comfortable doing this just because I ""read it on the internet"".

Wherever I go, the Ashton manual is recommended, which basically says switching to diazepam and taper off 1mg every 1-2 weeks. However, I cannot find the reliability of this manual. I'd like to discuss this manual with my family doctor to convince her giving me a tapering plan, but before I do, I want to make sure this manual is actually a reliable source of info. Also, I'd like to know if such severe withdrawal is normal.

**TL;DR**: Taking 0.5-1mg clonazepam daily for vague mental issue complaints. Tapering off is bullshit according to my therapist because I take a low amount. Extreme withdrawal starts when I quit cold turkey. I'm unable to see another therapist for now. I wonder if the Ashton manual is really a reliable source of info and would like to know is it's normal that I go into withdrawal for quiting clonazepam when taking such a low amount.",1
"I posted this in the depression subreddit, but it appears I was marked as spam. By the time they confirm otherwise (if they even do), it will be buried... so I’m trying this here -_-
I hate posting on an alt account, but my main account has too much tied to my real identity (location, pictures, name, past jobs and so on)

I’m not really sure why I’m posting here. Advice? Support? Catharsis in writing this out for anyone else to see? I have an opportunity to help my situation, but I’m not sure if the actual cost is worth it. First let me share something with you. I write these notes to myself weekly, monthly, depends on what’s happening in my life. I write them in the notes on my phone. I write them in word on my computer and hide the files. I write them on bits of paper and throw them away. But one thing is consistent, no matter what... I write these. So please let me share this first, and then I’ll explain my situation. My story is complex, and long, and maybe relatable. 

“Go for a walk and never stop until you find a cliff and walk yourself off it. You're so fucking worthless. A waste of this air you breathe. A waste of this space you take up. A waste of money. A waste of time. You're a fucking waste. A waste of talent. A waste of emotion. You suck up everything anyone has to give and you waste it. Kill yourself. I'm fucking serious. Kill yourself. You fucking waste of fucking energy. You're a fat piece of shit and everyone who told you so was right. A mother? No. A fucking failure at the most natural thing you're supposed to accomplish. A wife? Hardly. You spend all the money. You're fucking lazy. Kill yourself. Why do you keep wasting everyone's time? You're the most worthless soul to inhabit this planet and you don't deserve anything that you have. Not your baby. Not your husband. Not your job. You're just a waste. Fucking end it. “

It’s disturbing to read these when I’m not necessarily feeling what I felt to the extent I felt it when I wrote it. I’ve had depression since I was a teenager. Was hospitalized a few times. Medication never worked the way I was told it should. I tried therapy but it always felt odd and forced. I’ve had multiple traumatic events in my life that therapists said contribute to the way I feel (including being a first responder once upon a time), but I don’t agree with that. They focus on things that are in the past and I don’t care to think about or speak about. So eventually, I stopped trying medications, I stopped talking to therapists. I stopped. A year ago a physician put me on the lowest strength of Valium and a 20 pill prescription to help take the edge off my anxiety. I went through it in about 40 days. When I called to have it refilled, I was treated like a drug seeker and was questioned - like anxiety has some sort of schedule and you’re only allowed so may awful feelings in a certain time period. I did this dance for a few months and then gave up. I refuse to go back and I refuse to ask for help again. What’s just as bad as depression is to be made to feel like you’re less than. 

A few years ago, I stumbled across mushrooms. I’ll admit, the first time I did them was recreationally. I had no idea what I was about to find. After doing 1.5 grams, several weeks passed and my husband made an observation. I wasn’t angry all the time anymore. I was driven. I laughed. I wasn’t yelling at our son over the smallest things. Most importantly, I realized my brain was no longer telling me to kill myself every single day. It was life changing. We thought it was the mushrooms that did this, but we had no way to be sure. Eventually though, in 5-6 months, I started to go back to “normal”. My usual awful self. We decided to try the mushrooms again, this time to reapply pay attention to how I was in the weeks following. Again, same results. My brain quieted down. I felt what I imagine normal feels like. Don’t get me wrong, this was not a miracle. If something bad happened, I still felt sad. I had bad days just like anyone else. But they were not amplified to the degree depression makes them. I only did this one more time... but after that I became scared. What if I get caught? What if the shady friend of a friend of a friend gives me something laced? What if I go to jail and my son is taken from me? What would I do then? So I stopped looking for them. I gave up. 

In September of last year, I left my job. It was leave or be fired honestly. I worked in healthcare. The effects from the shrooms were long gone. Life was becoming exceptionally stressful. I started crying everyday at work. I was short with patients. Most of all, I was angry. Angry at everyone for everything. And so I left with no plan - I just needed to get out. Over the past several months, I didn’t realize what was happening. My husband was supportive at first (he will still say he is, but that underlying stress is there... I know it’s not ok), and I was hopeful to find a new job. I put out my resume to multiple places, but for the first time in my life I never even received a call back from a single one. This was a big blow. From that point on, I sat here. Sometimes I’d have an idea to make money, but usually it would fall through. I stopped seeing friends. I stopped talking to people. Just driving my son to and from school has become and ordeal. I go into Walmart and I’m just angry at everyone and everything, for absolutely no reason. I’ll loudly say “I HATE PEOPLE” when someone just walks past me without saying excuse me. While I may have thought that in my head before, I’ve never been so confrontational or just overwhelmingly angry. I’ve effectively removed myself from the world around me and pushed everything and everyone away. I didn’t even realize it until recently. 

A few weeks ago, I cried for an entire week. I didn’t stop unless I was asleep, so I just slept as much as I could. If I was awake, I was crying. There was no reason other than an intense sadness. I’ve always had this problem, but never for so long. Never so much. My husband almost took me to the hospital - it was concerning. 

Here’s the “I need advice” part:
A few days ago, my husband sent me a link to a ketamine clinic. I’d read about ketamine infusions before. I knew they have effectively treated depression. I sent them a message and a brief description of my situation. They replied, and in their reply they included the cost. $3000 USD. They have no financial assistance. Insurance does not cover the treatment. Payment is due upfront. I told my husband and he laughed and said there’s no way. I messaged them back and asked if fewer infusions were an option (this cost was for 6 treatments) and they said they couldn’t recommend that. The effects may be too short lived to be worth it. 

I am in a hole that I’m not sure how to climb out of. I’m disillusioned with the healthcare system, and I’m broke and miserable in my current state. No matter what, I know my mind is irrational. Even when I’m at my worst, I know my brain is my enemy. If and when I ever consider suicide, it’s not because I feel like there’s no hope, it’s because I feel like my brain is constantly attacking me and I don’t know how else to stop it anymore. Now... remember when I said I’m not working? Yea. We’re super broke. If I could scrape up the 3k for the treatment, I’m not sure how we’d ever manage to pay it back. If it works, I could return to normal, start working again, feel human again, make money so we could pay back the 3k. But what if it doesn’t work. My already strained marriage can’t take a 3k hit and then me still be in the same position I am now as I write this. I’m not sure what to do. I’m not sure how to fix this or change this or make any of this better. If I do nothing, I’m afraid things will just continue to get worse. If I do something, things can get exponentially better, or worse, quickly. 


If you’ve read this far - thank you. I know this was long. I’m a stranger. I doubt anyone on here actually gives a shit - we all have our battles. But I appreciate you regardless if you read this entirely. I’m hopeful someone has insight, advice, or just kind words. I need it right now.",1
"at about 2:00 AM after having taken a few valiums at 9:00 pm. and other at 12:00 Am. 1:00 AM, and seeing no relive from my dissociative severe flashbacks/OCD, i also take/took amitryptline for insomnia and risperidone for the flashback, as well as valium which is fine (btw) as it mostly does work just not on severe episodes. I took 2 extra Risperidone's so i upped from 1 to 3 mg mercilessly a couple hours ago as i was engulfed in anger from these disssociative flashbacks and mental anxiety, i also took one above of my amitryptline dosage. Is this an overdose, did i just wanna send my brain a message or get rapid relief? what now? it is 5:30 AM, i feel a bit groggy, drowsy, still a little obsessive but better as i tend to only have these flashabacks after dusk till 2-3 hours before dawn. I wanna tell my doctor but he won't prescribe Diazepam anymore if i do, it's the only thing that works mostly, tonight was just a really bad episode, Risperidone also used to help when i was on 3mg, but we stopped it as my weight gain was heading into type 2 fatty mcfattty obese mcdonalds range",1
"Hello I have the last couple of weeks started to have some very weird things going on. In late august I started to have very vivid dreams. Strange dreams which entailed anything from me killing someone to being kidnapped by small chinese girls. These dreams are extremely realistic and I remember them 100% percent after I wake up. The dreams are either very uncomfortable or very amusing, but mostly uncomfortable. This is affecting me emotionally as I have had very disturbing dreams that I can't get out of my head and the memory gets triggered by seemingly common things. I had this bizzare dream where a guy had fungus growing out of his body triggered by a parasite. For some reason whenever I smell plastic or new electronics I get the disgusting image of the guy laying there with fungi growing out his back and yellow pus seeping out of them. The dreams are not the only thing. About 2 weeks ago I started to get auditory and visual hallucinations. The visual hallucinations last less a second. They are hard to describe, but they typically go something like this. I am sitting occupied with something typically my telephone or computer, something in my side view like a plant which I have on my desk will suddenly morph into something, but they only last like 1-2 seconds. An example can be at my school when I was reading a book preparing for a test. I sit at the front row and the teachers desk there is a metal basket with ballpoint pens, calculators and other stuff which we can take as we wish. As I was reading my book the basket in my side view suddenly had little small guys grabing onto the basket like It was a jail cell. When it comes to auditorial hallucinations it is usally my parents calling out my name or subtle whispering where I can't make out what is being said. I also sometimes hear jackhammers and power tools when i shouldn't be hearing it. 

&#x200B;

These vivid dreams and hallucinations are extremly frightening. The dreams which are so weird make me feel ashamed of myself. I don't know what would cause this. I don't do any recreational drugs except weed and valium. I don't drink alcohol or any caffeine. I have taken performance enchancing drugs. I did take 200mg of testosterone a week for 12 weeks in late march. From the same date to present day I have taken 300mcg a day of GHRP-2. And from late june i did a 12 week cycle of epistane 20mg and 300mg of testosterone. I also have aspergers and OCD, but never been treated for it. I was prescribed zoloft for a couple of weeks when I was 16 for my OCD, but the side effects were unbearable and it made my OCD worse so quit that. I just want to know if I am developing some bad mental disorder or schizoprenia.

"ill preface this by saying im 18, im a female, i just took a non prescription xanax to help with the anxiety im having right now (i dont abuse them anymore) and im feeling very depressed

&#x200B;

im really sorry. i dont know exactly what im sorry for, but im sorry im me.

i want to change and do better but i dont know how. for as long as i can remember its been this way.

i hated school so much. i felt like an outsider. i remember in 1st grade we had free time to draw whatever we wanted. i drew myself crying and i took it home with me. my mum questioning me on it and made the assumption i was getting bullied.

she transferred me to a different school. i was teased by the other girls there. i used to hide under my bed every day before school, mum would call dad over and they would physically force me to attend. i pretended to be sick every day, i would try and force myself to vomit. sometimes i could.

my mum transferred me again but the bullying just got worst and my lying to evade school did too. i developed insomnia and mum couldn't handle it. she'd lock her door at night so i couldn't get in. i used to sleep next to her door and cry myself to sleep.

i cant really blame her for being so distant and cold to me. her dad was murdered when i was 7 weeks old. i dont think she was able to develop a connection with me.

my main bully lived with us, because his mum was my mums bestfriend needed help so he came to live with us for awhile. he sexually and physically abused me.

my school counselor told my mum that he couldn't see anything happening to me or any real problem with my mental health.

so much happened to me that you guys don't know, but i know im sorry i need to stop making excuses. i fucking know im just searching for attention. i think it might be because no one validated my feelings as a kid.

high school was a fresh start, i wasn't bullied there. i was actually pretty popular, but my hate for school never left. this made my mum resent me because we always argued about it. thats when i started abusing valium.

i overdosed multiple times but no one knew, they just thought i was sick. as a vomited everywhere at school. but mum wouldn't let me come home, because i was ""lying"" just like i did when i was a kid. passing out on my desk but i was just ""tired"" from staying up too late.

she made me stay with dad sometimes, who was even more depressed than i was. i watched him cut himself. i watched him abuse drugs. i was so sad. i wanted to make him better.

mum laughed at me when i told her i was suicidal.

when i was 15 years old i overdosed. i didnt want to die, i wanted everyone to understand the pain i was in. it was 5 days before christmas. everyone was angry that i had ruined christmas. i spent 3 days in hospital when i was let out on christmas eve. dad didnt even get out of his car to come see me and wish me merry christmas, he drove back to his house with my brothers because i wasnt stable enough to leave home yet.

i stopped using valium after that.

i was raped that year too. but thats one thing i dont like to describe in detail.

i dropped out of school. i couldn't do it, i couldn't face the world.

i tried to study, i tried to work. but i couldnt do it. i barely completed my two certificates with a less than 50% attendance rate and dropped out of my third. i quit 2 jobs. i just couldn't do it and im sorry. i know you all want me to be better but i just don't know how.

then 2 years after that when i was 17 my step dad who i thought the world of admitted to having sexual feelings for me. it ruined me, more than anything previously to that.

i guess thats when all the drug taking really kicked in, it makes you feel the best for the few hours you're high, but when you come down its just so sad realising how shitty life really is. watching everyone around you who is also using come down too, remembering things arent really as good as they seem when you're high.

im really sorry to everyone, to my boyfriend who told me that i need to stop making excuses. thats all im doing right now isn't it? im just making excuses. because i just don't want to live, i dont want to work, i don't want to study, but i dont want to hide in my bedroom anymore either. i don't really want to die either, im just existing. and its painful.

mum keeps telling me im a burden. she says ill end up like dad.

i know other people have it worse than me, i know that. im just weak and i can admit that. i want sympathy, i want someone who will tell me that my feelings are justified. but what would that even achieve?

so im just fucking sorry. i feel like an inconvenience on everyone. how am i supposed to break out of that? ive seen 5 psychologists now. 2 psychiatrists. im going to get a referral for my 3rd psychiatrist on tuesday.

im just fucking sorry. im sorry for feeling bad for myself. sorry for self-loathing. sorry i couldn't give my life to someone more deserving.

&#x200B;

im so so sorry. i just cant see myself living in this world. maybe its not for me?

i really wanted to do something great with me life, but i cant handle life so i dont think thats going to happen.",1
"Long story short my mum and I fall out a lot, (mostly from her opinion) but it takes two to tango. I express myself with tattoos and music and weapons to relax and release. And even though my mother has used all three of these things to help her, she insists on shaking her head at me and staring at me as if I’d just took everything out of her purse. My dad always says leave it and he is right but my mum still thinks that and believes it. Makes me feel less human, less of a part of the family, less loved, less cared for and the list can go in and in. And of course my coping mechanism is drugs, always cannabis, and Valium, when I haven’t run out. (which is always) I punch walls I cry I get angry at myself, just because my parent doesn’t approve of my expression techniques. I don’t know what I’m asking for here, whether it’s advice on how to cope or avoid it or find someone in the uk that can supply me with 10mg Valium because I’m sick of feeling like nothing ",1
"I'll try to keep it short, and I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but my fiance had a terrible grad school experience towards the end. It brought on an anxiety disorder (or worsened an underlying one), some depression, which combined to bring on terrible insomnia and eventually culminated in a stress-induced seizure.

I eventually talked him into seeing the doctor (he was reluctant) and he walked away with an anti-depressant, a few valium, and ambien prescriptions.

This is where it gets a little hairy. We also take some drugs recreationally. Weed and some technically legal drugs (benzos and tianeptine) which you can order online and they ship to your house. We don't/didn’t do them too often (~1x a week), but sometimes it’s nice to switch it up instead of alcohol, which gives an awful hangover the next day.

Well, after the seizure, he told me that he had been taking these online order drugs daily to self-medicate his stress levels. So when I thought he was just tired after a sleepless night half the time it turned out he was high on benzos or tianeptine. I was mad but I tried to be understanding, I helped him taper off these things, and occasionally we still took them recreationally after he had tapered down. Or so I thought.

Fast forward a year later, we have both graduated, I have a job and he is still searching, and he has had several relapses. He orders them online, has them delivered when I’m not home, hides them bizarre places, tells me elaborate and conflicting lies about them, and frankly we have had an on-going fight on-and-off over the last 11 months.

Today I found out that his “feeling sick and under the weather” for the last 3 days was actually him going through withdrawal. I can't find all the hiding places or see when the mail is delivered when I'm at work, and it’s still hard to tell if he's just tired or is fucked up. And I only found out about the withdrawal because I asked him if he was sick or if it was something else (he rarely comes forth to tell the truth unless I ask directly, which is a “fun” guessing game…). I come home to have this discussion (he told me via text then phone call), and find out that he has drunk a fifth of whiskey to deal with his feelings.

It has gotten to the point where our relationship needs fixing, and trust needs to be rebuilt, and I essentially said I can't handle it anymore, and he either has to get help, or I'm not going to stick around. I'm not going to keep paying his credit cards when he uses them to fund this habit!

My issue is, I'm not quite sure where to seek help. I don’t really want to have him labelled as a drug user for the rest of his life in his medical records, but I know he needs help. But do I start with a mental health facility because this is a symptom of anxiety, depression, self-confidence, etc and has spiraled out of control? Or do I start with a substance abuse facility, even though when I called a helpline they had no idea what the drugs were?

TD;LR: Fiance has been self-medicating with technically legal drugs to help anxiety, self-confidence, insomnia and potentially some depression. He has agreed to get help because I said I can’t handle it anymore, and I’m not sure whether to seek out help from a mental health facility or a substance abuse facility.",1
Iv been on anti depressants for 14 years diagnosed with depression anxiety and panic disorder. Currently on 200mg of sertraline (zoloft) i cannot cope with people and conversations people talk to me and i become extremely irratable and just answer yes or no or with a giggle i dont think i even hear what people are saying as im trying so hard to control myself so i dnt loose control it seems. I dont visit family i dont go out i dont socialise i do nothing. I have no energy what so ever no motivation at all. When i have or do go out on the odd occasion i cant wait to get back indoors as my eyes feel really weird like i dont no where too look or what im ment to be looking at.

I feel like i auto pilot through life ,1
"In a bit of a FML moment last night I began writing bits and pieces of my life story trying to piece together what made me the way I am. I still don't know but I've never shared this kind of stuff with anyone, anywhere. It's compressed pieces of my life's story. Maybe someone can offer a unique perspective... or not.

&nbsp;

I seriously can't cope any longer with my anxiety/stress/depression and my reactions to triggers are becoming predictably unpredictable. Here's my background, not that it really matters but I guess I just want to share my story. Scroll WAAAY down for the TL;DR

&nbsp;

I've suffered from anxiety and panic attacks since about the age of 14-15 and over the last 20 years I've gotten progressively worse. I'm a bi-racial guy and as a child I was raised by a teenage single white mother in impoverished majority black neighborhoods most of my life. My mother's parents kicked her out of their home during her senior year of high school because of her pregnancy. I don't think that my father's ethnicity had anything to do with it, I think it was the more the whole sex/pregnancy before marriage religious, ""you want to act like an adult"" thing. We lived with my grandmother (father's mother) for the first 2 years of my life which I have no recollection of. My father got increasingly abusive, both physically and verbally to my mother and insisted on controlling every single thing she did. After an accumulation of abuse my mother left. We had no where to go even though we had dozens of relatives in the area including both sets of grandparents, 3 of my fathers older siblings and their spouses, 3 of my mom's older siblings and their spouses, and countless other extended family members. Even with so many family members in the area (some of which were well off financially), we ended up in a homeless shelter. I have no clue how long we were in the shelter. My mom worked at a fast food restaurant and survived mostly off of government assistance. My father was a high-school drop out auto mechanic who lived with his parents until his late 20s rent free without any responsibilities. I don't understand how and why no one took me in, at least until my mother was semi-stable, rather than letting an innocent child who is a family member live in a homeless shelter. It's not like they didn't know where we were.

&nbsp;

The women's shelter matched single mothers together to become roommates and after about a year my mother and her first roommate got a roach and rat infested apartment in one of the worst areas of the city (a major east coast metropolitan area during the crack epidemic). After a couple of months my mom's roommate met a man and left us high and dry. The shelter matched my mother with a new roommate, this lasted a bit longer. Maybe a year and a half or so. During this time my mother and I weren't in contact with my father or any of his family. Eventually my father's oldest sister who was stationed in Germany tracked us down from overseas and after months of negotiation convinced my mother that she should allow me to spend time with their family, regardless of her relationship with my father. My mother obliged. During this time I spent time mainly with my grandparents (father's parents). Everyone else I knew by name and face but didn't have a relationship with. I did however have a solid relationship with my mother's family, who were all financially stable and established. They would include me in family functions and looking back they definitely treated me a bit different. More along the lines of special treatment. Pity perhaps?

&nbsp;

Fast-forward - I started slowly being introduced to different family members on my father's side. One particular aunt and uncle took a special interest in me and offered to keep me on weekends and babysit whenever my mother wanted. They had a baby that was born the same year that I was that died around 6-8 months old. They were super religious freaks who had a church of their own. They were also the most abusive people I've ever encountered. I was beaten, badly, numerous occasions and for no good reason. Just one of the many incidents I still remember was being forced to eat my aunt's horrible cooking, it was liver. I couldn't stomach it, so I didn't want to eat it but because there were starving kids in Africa somewhere who would love to eat their shitty food my aunt and uncle felt it necessary to stand over me with a belt and force me to eat it while beating me. My uncle stood over me at the dining room table with a leather belt and beat the hell out of me. The beating would not stop until my plate was clean. Every bite I took I gagged, each time I gagged I was hit with a belt. My aunt joined in and would slap me in addition to my uncle hitting me with a belt. I was crying bloody murder. The food was so horrible and the beating was so brutal that I vomited all over my plate and the table. Next on the menu? My own vomit. I was forced to eat the rest of their shitty food, as well as my vomit. Then I was sent into the room to watch one of those religious TV shows, the Kenneth Copeland variety for hours and hours. Another time my uncle took me out into his back yard to play catch. The bastard couldn’t throw a football to save his live, unfortunately it was my life that needed saving. I didn’t catch any one of the pass that he threw. Frustrated by me not catching his way off the mark passes, he yelled out “if you drop this next pass I’m sicking Lightening on you!” Lightening was his vicious white German Shepard. That dog had just as many mental problems as these two assholes did. I kept telling my uncle that I didn’t want to play catch any more. What I wanted didn’t matter. Needless to say, I didn’t catch the ball and then got mauled by his German Shepard. 

&nbsp;

For some reason I was afraid to tell my mother the extent that I was beaten and abused but it’s hard to hide being mauled by a dog. After that day I was never welcomed back to their home, which was a relief! Years later I found out the reason why was that my father beat the hell out of my uncle... one of the few times he ever did anything for me. The next year they adopted my great-aunt’s children who’s mother was strung out on crack. Those kids were severely abused as well. They all had random broken bones, bruises, cuts, and other injuries. The 8 year old girl was routinely beaten with 2x4s and molested. All of this abuse went on in between the times that my aunt and uncle paraded these poor abused children around their church while their congregation praised Jesus because the pastor and his wife rescued these children from a drug attic and gave them a stable Christian home. The 3 kids were eventually taken away (by the state I think?) but there were never any criminal charges or jail time involved. As an adult, I really wonder if their 6-8 month baby really did die in her sleep. 

&nbsp;

Moving on - I spent less time with that side of the family and more time with my mother’s family. I was coming from a shoebox apartment with roaches, rats, drug dealers and addicts in the hallways at all times and going to suburban single family homes with guest rooms. What a drastic contrast. I remember always thinking WTF is a guest room? I seriously didn’t understand the concept of a guest room. My bedroom was a walk-in closet with a foam chair that folded out into a single mattress. I ate school cafeteria breakfasts and lunches then peanut butter and jelly for dinner. My mother relied heavily on the school to feed me and provide a form of childcare.

&nbsp;

I spent the next few years in before school and after school programs, not because it was beneficial to my education but because it was free child care while my mother worked. In the 2nd grade I was selected to attend a magnet school because according to guidance counselors, teachers, and school administrators I was exceptionally gifted academically and needed to be placed into an advanced curriculum. In this school/classes there were absolutely no kids from my neighborhood in any of them. I easily excelled making the honor roll, principal’s list, and received numerous academic achievements. By now my mother had stable employment and purchased a crappy row house in another rough neighborhood. Unfortunately in this neighborhood, excelling in school was frowned upon. After attending the Young Astronauts, 4H, Chess, or Book clubs after school I would have to walk home. I became a target for what felt like was the entire neighborhood to attack. Afraid to fight even if it were to defend myself, I was beaten up regularly. Looking back, it honestly didn’t hurt much physically but the wounds were psychological. I felt powerless. I was very vulnerable and had no one to protect me and no adult supervision being that I was a latch key kid. My mother was at work from sun up to sun down. This was way before the anti-bullying campaigns of today. She would come home see me crying about how afraid I was to walk home after school. Her answer was just to avoid the kids that were beating me up. Yeah, that really works in a small neighborhood. I spent the next few months trying everything I could to avoid being seen in the neighborhood. It never worked. I didn’t understand why I was being beaten up by neighborhood kids, many of who I played with regularly during the summer before the school year started. I didn’t understand the aggression towards me. My mother enrolled me into Taekwondo thinking that after a few classes I would be Bruce Lee. Now I was the smart kid in the neighborhood that knew karate... and got his ass kicked regularly. It’s kind of funny now that I look back. They would call me “karate kid” while beating my ass. My hope was that by not fighting back they would lose interest in beating me up. How naive of me. 

&nbsp;

By junior high I refused to participate in my advanced classes. I would sit in class dressed like a hoodlum, disinterested in school work. My main concern was to devise ways to not be bullied or picked on. There were numerous meetings with principals, guidance counselors, and my mother. I remember saying that I didn’t wanted to take algebra and biology in 6th grade, I wanted to be in regular math and science classes with the regular kids. Probably one of the biggest mistakes I made as a child but I didn’t know any better. I ended up back in regular classes with the below average students. In the regular classes where I also refused to do any school work and spent most of the year in in-school suspension, detention, and in and out of principal’s offices. No one could figure out how I went from one of the brightest kids in the city to a complete failure. I was then placed in the classes for the kids that rode the short bus. The class was for the “emotionally disturbed.” That couldn’t have been a more accurate description of what I was at the time. The worse I did in school the more popular I became, the more “cool” I was. The neighborhood kids along with the same type of kids from other neighborhoods finally accepted me as one of them.

&nbsp;

Around this time I started smoking cigarettes and skipping school for weeks at a time. All the girls in school were in love with me, all the “street dudes” wanted to be friends with me. I was finally cool! I finally started standing up for myself and fighting back because now I have the reputation of being a bad ass. I also became a bully in a sense. 

&nbsp;

After missing school for a month and a half, hanging out with the drug dealers in the neighborhood until well after midnight at 12-13 years old. I essentially dropped out of school in the 8th grade. I was full of rage at this time. It was an uncontrollable anger that I would only take out on authority figures including my mother. I felt that no one could tell me what to do, I can do what I want and no one can stop me. My mother eventually had enough of her out of control and verbally abusive son and filed a petition with the city. There were also the many times she called me derogatory names in describing to me how I was just like my father when I was acting this way. I was often reminded about how I ruined her life and because of me she never had any meaningful relationships with anyone. I was that much of an embarrassment I suppose. She reminded me how much of a worthless piece of shit I was. These days I think the reason that she never had any meaningful relationships is that she is also mentally ill. To this day, 20 years later, she lives alone and still has no friends. She hasn’t been with a man since my father while they were in high-school and she’s in her mid-50s. She also has never stood up for herself and knowing lets people take advantage of her, especially financially. These days she’s making a 6 figure salary. 

&nbsp;

Anyways this only fueled my anger towards her back then and I continued to lash out taking it further and further each time. One day a police officer showed up to the house and asked me to get dressed then put my hands behind my back. I was arrested and taken to the juvenile detention center because I was considered a child in need of court ordered supervision. I was mortified, until I got there and saw that I knew majority of the juvenile inmates from the neighborhood/school. By this time I was no longer being bullied or beaten up and I was accepted as a “street dude.” I became a follower and rarely had an opinion when it came to hanging out with these “street dudes.” 

&nbsp;

2 years in juvenile detention then in and out of group homes I was so far removed from being the most likely to succeed and closer to the most likely to die due to gang violence. I became an alcoholic at around 15 years old. Still had very little contact with my father and his family at this time. I struggled with alcohol until my early 20s. My first panic attack I had was after smoking weed for the first time at 13 years old. I tried weed a few more times and each time I would have a major panic attack but at the time I didn’t know that it was a panic attack, I thought that’s what being high felt like. Needless to say I wasn’t much of a weed smoker. I dropped out of school again completely in 9th grade and pursued a career in selling street level narcotics. Luckily I was never busted because every last one of my friends at the time were. By now my mother and I had a hate-hate relationship. Looking back it’s sad. She picked up and moved over 1200 miles away because of a job transfer, leaving me homeless which I admit at the time I probably deserved. I had no where to go. Because of my new lifestyle I now had hardcore gang members that wanted to kill me. I had people in my neighborhood who I ran the streets for years with become adversaries. I think that the more popular I became the more the very same people that I was desperate to be accepted by hated me. 

&nbsp;

While being homeless I became well acquainted with my father’s family but not my father. I lived with a few family members for short periods here and there and ultimately moved in with my father’s oldest sister (the one who tracked my mother and I down from Germany) and she recognized the signs of mental illness that I displayed. She gave me my family’s history as far as mental illnesses and told me which drugs that each family member was taking and which drugs they’ve tried that didn’t work. Apparently severe anxiety and depression was genetic. My grandmother took Valium, my father took Prozac and Valium (later the Valium was replaced with 1mg Xanax), my father’s middle sister took Zoloft, Xanax, and Ambien. My aunt that divulged all of this information told me that she took Ambien, and Zoloft while alternating between Xanax and Valium then later Seroquel. I didn’t believe that I had a mental illness and no one could convince me that I did, not even my aunt that was familiar with my entire family’s history. Literally everyone on that side of the family was on a cocktail of anti-depressants and benzos. I refused to acknowledge her observations of my behavior. I wasn’t crazy like them. At least that’s what I told myself. 

&nbsp;

I will always hold a special place in my heart for this aunt. She tried to get me help but I refused. It was living here with my aunt that I met my girlfriend (and current fiancé.) My fiance was very educated, completely sheltered her entire life, she was the exact opposite of who I was. She is a black woman that grew up in an all white neighborhood, and feared most black people. I found it funny that she had no idea who the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was in the 90s, that show was considered too raunchy in her household. She was completely oblivious to everything that wasn’t school related. She was easy to take advantage of, by everyone because of her innate desire to fit in, much like me. She felt that she wasn’t accepted by anyone. She would go to great lengths to feel accepted by her peers as well, to the point that no one hung out with her because she was awkward. We met through my aunt who asked her to show me around town. She was intrigued by my story and my lifestyle and the same could be said for me. 

&nbsp;

I ended up moving out of my aunt’s house because I still had a problem with authority. My uncle and aunt were a military family, authority and discipline was a major part of their household. By now the only meaningful job I had as a high-school drop-out was at a fast food restaurant as a store manager. I eventually got fired for... you guessed it... problems with authority. 

&nbsp;

After not speaking to my mother for 2 years we finally made our peace. It was a long road to recovery because of how strained our relationship was and because we both are mentally ill, which incidentally runs in her family too anxiety and depression. We’re actually the best of friends now. By now I was still drinking everyday and excessively. The 1 friend that I had along with my family were all concerned about how much I was drinking. I was shit-faced everyday.

&nbsp;

I ended up joining a boxing gym in attempt to get over my fear of people. Much like academics years before, I excelled at boxing. Boxing helped conquer the many years of rage and added the much needed discipline I lacked my entire life. Boxing became my life. My trainers decided it was time to start my amateur career with the hopes of turning pro shortly after. I stopped drinking completely while preparing to become an amateur prize fighter, and haven’t had a drink since, still to this day. Injury after injury derailed what most of us thought would be a promising boxing career. 

&nbsp;

Welcome to opiates. Injuries = vicodin, percocet, morphine etc... Who would’ve thought that these little pills would cure my anxiety and make me feel like a million bucks? Luckily I didn’t fall deep into an uncontrollable addiction but for a few years in my mid to late 20s I would use opiates as a crutch to overcome my anxiety issues. I was super comfortable trying new things and being around new people. They worked great, until they didn’t work. Still being somewhat of an athlete, nothing could ever touch the feeling of lacing up a pair of boxing gloves and getting in the ring, even if it were only to spar at this point. I continued training and even began training other people. I accidentally started and led a free exercise group that met at a public park 3 times per week. I realized that while I was working out (I’m sure something to do with the endorphins) that I could tolerate being around people and I was social for the first time in my life. My fiance and I were living together and this was the most comfortable I’ve ever been in my life. The exercise group kept growing and growing. People told other people who told other people, etc. Even though this was the best I’ve ever felt I was still battling depression and anxiety behind closed doors. The group eventually disbanded as my anxiety started rearing it’s ugly head again. I would cancel workouts, purposely reschedule, and did everything else I could think of to sabotage the only thing that made me happy. 

&nbsp;

Somewhere along the way of this story I became an IT administrator with a handful of meaningless certifications at a job I despise. I’ve been here for 13 years now. I hate it. My anxiety and fear of people won’t let me as much apply for a new job, let alone interview or dare I say accept a new job. I feel like I’m too unreliable even though I haven’t had a vacation in over 2 years and seldom call off of work.

&nbsp;

2 years ago I proposed to fiancé (then girlfriend). Last year we were expecting our first child and she had a miscarriage at 8 weeks. Weirdly it didn’t affect me much. Life went on. I feel kind of bad that I was indifferent. Later in the year we tried again, we made it 5 months until she went into premature labor from an incompetent cervix. She gave birth to our son who died during birth. He wouldn’t have survived at 5 months, but that was one of the hardest things I’ve witnessed. I couldn’t bring myself to cut the umbilical cord or hold him when they brought him over to us. I haven’t cried in decades and this was the first time I broke down, I felt powerless again. Sure I’m a hell of a boxer still to this day, the last time I felt powerless it was because I couldn’t defend myself, I couldn’t stand up for myself. I can more than adequately defend myself now and I swore I’d never feel powerless again. Joke’s on me. So as we’re struggling to get through the loss of our child we decide to buy a house. Why? I don’t know. I guess it was still part of the family planning routine that we devised. We haphazardly rushed into the house buying process while grieving and ended up in a POS. Our inspector missed a few high dollar problems that we can’t afford to fix, and I’m extremely handy.... just not this handy. I want out. I’ve been 1.5 hours late to work every day for the past 8 months. I’m surprised I still have a job. I’d really prefer to work at home since in IT there’s nothing I do at the office, which is modeled after a bullpen, that I can’t do at home and more efficiently. Telecommuting is completely unacceptable at my company. My panic attacks have gone from my normal 1-2 every other month to 4-5 per week. The vicious cycle of anxiety leading to depression and vice versa has worn me down. I can’t take life anymore. I hate my life. I hate my anxiety. I hate everything. I’m beginning to hate my fiancé who has been nothing but supportive and patient with me. I associate everything bad that has happened to me over the last year with her, even though she’s not responsible for most of it. I’ve tried seeing doctors and none of them actually listen to me. I went 30 years without taking any medication for depression/anxiety and finally gave in a few years back. I feel like the doctors I’ve seen don’t bother to diagnose the patient, they attempt to treat the symptoms, and poorly in my case. I don’t have the money to go to CBT of any other type of talk based therapy. My job cut our health care since they’re not required to offer health benefits since we are a company of under 50 technically (though we hire hundreds of contract workers). 

&nbsp;

Last August after losing my son I had a physical and my kidney function is impaired according to my GFR results. My GFR was 68 and then 74 90 days later. I don’t know what that’s about because I’m generally a healthy person. 

&nbsp;

I can’t deal with any more stress, but everything stresses me out which causes me to have frequent panic attacks. I just can’t deal with life any more and my anxiety has strained my relationship with my fiancé. I’m beginning to hate her, for no reason it all especially when all she does is try to help me cope. I currently have no friends to talk to, no one to hangout with, I moved away from my hometown 16 years ago and have yet to make 1 friend.

&nbsp;

On the outside it’s easy for people that know me who don’t know my past to think I have everything a person could possible want and shouldn’t have any worries. Rumination, panic attacks, lack of sleep and intrusive thoughts are my biggest problems these days.

&nbsp;

That’s my compressed life story leading me up to the TL;DR
Over the past few years I’ve been to many doctors and no one has been able to help with my anxiety that has ultimately led to depression, my depression in turn leads to anxiety. I’ve been suffering more frequent panic attacks and my doctors have given me the following and none of which helped:

&nbsp;

Celexa 15mg

Wellbutrin 150/300mb

Zoloft 25/50/100mg

Elavil - I think 20mg

Buspar(sp?) 15mg

Hydroxizine 25mg

Trazadone 50/100mg

Ambien 10mg - actually works but my current insurance doesn’t cover it.

Lunesta 2mg

Klonipin .25mg - .5mg

Seroquel 25mg (for sleep)

Some kind of Beta Blocker to lower my already normal blood pressure which is supposed to help with panic attacks

I’ve bummed Valium and Xanax off of family members and Valium seems to be the most effective but I haven’t met a doc or psychiatrist willing to write me a prescription for it because it’s a “dated drug” and there are better alternatives (none of which help). I don’t sleep, I haven’t been eating lately.

"two weeks ago, I was laid up in the resuscitation unit, tubes hanging out my arms, a machine beeping, mum begging me to keep my eyes open. I'd taken 96 tablets, over the counter co-codamol, in an attempt to end my life.  And fucking hell I came close to death.

For the past eight years I had never confronted my mental health issues; taking a staunchly British stiff upper lip, keep calm and carry on attitude despite a multitude of suicide attempts.  It finally came to a head when I fell head over heels for someone I had never met; I fought my own war in my mind daily and talking to her was almost akin to sitting down in the aftermath of battle and exchanging love letters with the girl back home.  I felt at home, I felt safe.  We agreed to meet, I booked the train tickets and hotel room for Saturday, I was to leave Saturday after work, arrive in the evening, spend time with her and go back to the hotel room by myself, then see her the next day before departing to be back Sunday evening.  Only that never happened.  She dropped contact on the Thursday, I figured she might have lost her phone or something, nothing seemed abnormal until that point so I held out hope.  Saturday came and I couldn't function; I went to work for a four hour shift and spent most my time crying my eyes out.  Bear in mind I'm a 23 year old, 16 stone, warehouse job, bearded, I guess quite ""manly"" on the surface.  That afternoon I stayed in my home town and drank like I was 18 again, I took a valium before going out to drink, I had another pill when I returned home for dinner, went back out to carry on drinking, came home and took another valium before heading to bed, hoping the concoction would put me in a deep sleep.  I was rapidly approaching rock bottom, a place I thought I'd hit when I was drinking and taking coke frequently.  By Wednesday she returned, apologised and we tried to return to how we were, and it worked for a while.  I look back and what I felt was close to love, as close as it can get in that situation anyway.  Then one night she dropped contact again, so suddenly because we were happily chatting as if nothing had happened.  I lost my mind and took ten tramadol, again in the hope for a deep sleep, praying for it to be permanent.  This is when I realised I was spiralling downward.

I spoke to my doctor about how I was feeling, the constant pressure from the back of my head wanting to force myself into the path of incoming vehicles, looking and knifes wondering how deep I could cut.  I also suffer with chronic neck and shoulder pain from a car accident roughly 18 months ago, but more on that later.  I was given a prescription for citalopram, and that forced me into a further downward trajectory.  Counselling helped me come to terms with the car accident I was involved in and was told by several mental health specialists that I was suffering with a form of post traumatic stress disorder.  I gave the citalopram the required six weeks trial, and began counselling.  During those six weeks I got worse and worse with each day, culminating in the most recent overdose.  Most nights I would sit on a bridge overlooking a railway line, contemplating ending my life.   Nearing the end of the seventh week I finally lost control.  I was being made to feel guilty at work for using paid time off for counselling sessions I had prebooked six weeks in advance rather than keep taking sick time.  The aforementioned girl in my life told me she never wants to be together and wasn't willing to try, she wanted to stay friends but after everything we shared she just dropped all of that and expecting me to do the same.  I recall leaving the gym on that Friday night with one thought in my mind: kill yourself and you can be free.

I arrived home that night and retrieved my multi tool, a Swiss Army Knife-type with a short blade, and went to work on my bicep, teasing the vein until I'd draw blood, then relaxing.  Teasing the part of me that wanted to die.  I lived, and the next morning, a Saturday with no responsibilities whatsoever, I drove to three separate pharmacies and purchased my works; three packets of 32 tablets each.  I went to my favourite coffee shop for a peppermint tea and nothing felt the same.  I was in a familiar environment and couldn't relax.  I took myself home, got a pint of water and went to work, shovelling down handfuls of sixteen pills at a time, washing them down with water.  I still remember the full buzz in my head, I was finally doing it, after all this time living with the guilt and remorse, I was making motions to end my life.

I then woke up Sunday morning in a hospital bed, thinking it was Saturday morning and I was in my own bed, until I moved and felt the pull of an IV tube.  What had I done?  It was 7am but I checked my texts and there was a flood of support from immediate family, I've never felt so ashamed than I did that morning.  I spent under two days recovering, discharged Monday afternoon feeling as if I had squashed that evil part of me.  But it still lurks in the shadows of my mind.  Addiction.  Pain.  Grief.  Guilt.  Four factors that lead me into a dark place, but I've found the light.

I've cut off contact with she who I would love to name and shame, but won't out of respect.  I'm currently signed off work and I'm using that time to bring myself to a better place.  I've enrolled in an adult education class in screenwriting, hoping one day to hone my writing skills and do something; I'm not sure what, but I've been given a second chance at life and it is for the living.  I don't believe in religion but if there is something controlling the program; be it a god, the illuminati or some bored kid playing a real life version of The Sims; I lived.  When the chips were down, when I was staring death in the face, I told him to go fuck himself.

And anyone else can too.  If there's one thing I've learned, and I hope to pass it on to anyone who needs just a speckle of guidance; it's that true strength comes from within, it comes from a place so deep in your soul that sometimes you need to be in such an evil and dark place to feel that strength drag you away, with all your might and soul.  I'm not cured, but I'm getting better.  The accident has affected me more than I like to admit, but that's something I'm working on.

Small steps.",1
"not sure if throwaway or start of an alternate.  i'm a 33 year old guy from australia.  i experienced my first bouts of depression, anxiety and self harm about 12 years ago.  back then as i got better i learned a bunch of rules for not fucking up my life while i was depressed.  don't spend any money.  don't express negative emotion towards anyone.  don't make any major decisions.  etc etc, you know the drill.  i get better.  i move on with my life.  it's 2003 and i'm finished uni.  everything is good.

fast forward to 2008.  the occasional depressive episode starts to creep in.  it's rare and not the end of the world, so i accept it as a 'thing' leftover from before and move on with my life.

2011 .. my mental health starts going downhill.  i deal with it, because i can.

2012 .. it's getting worse.

2013 .. it's unbearable.  i realise that although i can handle it and keep on with my life, i don't have to.  i can get help.  i get help.  i try a few different medications and treatment regimes.  i start to accept that i probably have cyclothymia, which is basically bipolar lite, with some anxiety on the side.  i get some valium into me to relieve the anxiety and can identify both depressive and manic episodes.  various things interrupt these treatments and many things go wrong in the strictly chemical treatment of these conditions.  after digging into my family history i realise the family i thought were alcoholics were probably all dealing with this but self-medicating with booze.

2014 .. major relationship ends.  new one starts.  new girlfriend is .. actually amazing.  but i realise i have developed a habit of switching all my emotions off when they get too much.  i realise this is all related to the risk-reduction of my coping strategies, and try to disband them in an effort to better get to the root cause of my problems and try to understand what im experiencing.

this is not a pleasant decision.  thus began possibly the worst four days of my life.  worse than my fiancee leaving.  worse than my best friend dying.  everything i'd been putting into bypass for years, all coming out at once.  four days of absolute extreme mental torture.  by day 2 i was losing my mind.  by day 3 i'd lost the motivation to feed myself or go to work.  at this stage i'd have rathered be on fire than continue existing, and i don't know if any of you have been on fire but it is unpleasant.  by the end of day 4 i was sleeping at 8pm and crawled to bed from the couch.

it's the end of day 5.  i woke up this morning and it had broken.  i saw my psychiatrist this morning and got a new medication regime, and got a new psychologist who actually seems to know what the fuck he's doing.  i can see some hope for the first time in .. i don't know.  a long time.  i realise now i'd kind of resigned myself to having to push through it and be stronger than it but i realise that was flawed from the beginning.

i don't know what i hoped to achieve by posting this here but despite having good, loving friends who i can talk to, who helped me through this, i feel as if there's something about writing this on an internet place that is necessary and cathartic.

don't give up.  there's hope for all of us.  even you.  even me.",1
"Hi, everyone! Before I start I want to say English is not my native language, so if I make any mistakes, sorry about that!

Anyways, I'm in need of advice because lately I've been very worried about my best friend! She's always been quite hot-headed and snappish but in the past few months she has been treating her boyfriend in a downright mean way. They've been together for about a year and they've always had lots of fights but now more so than ever. She will literally get mad at him for nothing. For example, recently the three of us were watching Breaking Bad which he says he has seen 3 times and this is the fourth time he'll be watching it. At one point he asked something along the lines of ""When did this happen?"" and my best friend got mad and told him that he must be lying about having seen the show three times already because ""if [she] had watched it that many times [she] would have memorised the whole script already!"". He then asked why she was getting mad at him for no reason (in a neutral tone, btw) and she started yelling that she was getting mad at his lies and then she got up and said she was leaving. He started apologizing immediately and trying to make her stay and she finally did it but was still obviously angry. And I wouldn't describe her as a person who values honesty all that much. Actually, the three of us are kinda sorta pathological liars. I can't think of anymore examples right now but it's always ridiculous stuff like that that she gets mad about. She never does this with me but I guess I should mention that I'm somewhat of a doormat and I hate conflict so I always try to avoid it at any cost by agreeing with her about everything. He's very similar to me, personality-wise but he still at least tries to stand up for himself every once in a while. Most of the time she starts yelling at him about such stupid things that I'm convinced she's just entertaining herself by watching him suffer (she's literally sadistic but that is a quality of hers that both me and him usually find charming). Sometimes when she's having a fight with him she'll smile at me when he's not looking. But other times she'll roll her eyes, as if telling me that she thinks he's an idiot. It could be that she wants him to try to apologize to her by hugging her since he does that a lot but most of the time she'll yell at him for that, too, screaming ""Don't touch me!"". So I just don't know.

Another thing is that she has ZERO social anxiety and she's been singing on stage since she was three years old and has never had stage fright. For the past several months, though, or maybe the whole year, I'm not sure, she's been having some issues with her whole body and her voice shaking when she goes on stage and she keeps saying she's not nervous but she has started taking valerian (or is it called valium in English?), even in her everyday life, not just when she's about to perform. She's had low blood pressure problems since she was 12, I think, but it might have been getting worse lately. She also says her heart sometimes beats faster and that the valerian is going to help but in her boyfriend's opinion this (the low blood pressure and faster heart rate) has been been happening BECAUSE of the valerian. She's also been smoking weed roughly three times a week, although she stopped at one point for a month and a half, for the past two years since she was 14. Both her mother and her grandma from her dad's side of the family have schizophrenia and I've read that weed might trigger this for you if you're under risk.

Also, about a month ago she told me that her whole life she's been ""on autopilot"". She said she never thinks, she just does thinks impulsively. This is very evident in my opinion, both in the way she acts and especially in the way she talks. When we first met I legitemately thought she had some sort of mental disorder. She has the wackiest (and funniest) sense of humour I've ever seen and she constantly says things that don't make sense or don't even form a coherent sentence. She has been like this way, way before she started smoking weed. She can sometimes speak in a relatively normal way when she knows I want us to have a serious conversation but it doesn't come naturally to her. I'll just give one example of a nonsensical thing she said yesterday. Her boyfriend hugged her and she just stood there and he asked ""Aren't you gonna hug me back?"" and she said, in a surprised tone ""And a shipwreck, yes."". He usually ignores her, I laugh my butt off and that's that. But maybe it's a sign she might have some problem? I really don't know what to think at this point. About a year and a half ago she was diagnosed with a hormone imbalance - she had too much estrogen - but as far as I'm aware they took care of that. 

So she could have a physical problem, she might have a mental problem, I don't know. I'm just worried about her and I don't know what to do. I don't think she'd agree to seeing a therapist or something like that because she says she doesn't like how they put labels on everybody. How could I help her? What questions should I ask her to maybe get more information about her mental state? I'm just worried and I want to help if I can.",1
"I've recovered from psychosis, with no hallucinations and only very peripheral delusions that don't interfere with my functioning. My last hospitalization was 2010, and I'm 25 now in 2014. Since recovering, my biggest problem has always been anxiety, which my psychiatrist prescribes me xanax or valium for. I have had insomnia since I was 6. I'm about to receive my Associate's in Liberal Arts from a very shitty school so I can transfer and get my Bachelor's in history from a less shitty school. All of a sudden, in my last semester here, I think I'm having one of those young adult college breakdowns.

It might be hormonal (I used to be medicated for PMDD [pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder - pms on steroids], but we ended up thinking my pre-menstrual rage was because of BPD [borderline personality disorder - quick bursts of unmanageable moods]), but if it is, I still need help. In the last couple months, I've had increasingly infrequent respites from three main states: anxious, depressed, and asleep. I'm sleeping, as always when I'm sick, without trouble. I go down easily and wake up early. But then my days feel like dreams and I can't remember what I did 2 hours prior. I feel jagged, broken, fragile. Every noise, every movement, every memory feels like a violent assault. I cry for as much as 6 hours straight, and that's what happens on a good day... On a bad day, I can barely move because my heart hurts so much.

My mother, a veteran sort of mom having navigated The System for me, is dying to help me but her manner is... brusque? I think is the word? And overly practical and she tries to make every little thing so palatable when it's just not. It's so totally not what I need, and beyond what I can handle hearing. My stepdad cannot be bothered to listen, talk, or even sit in the same room with with us because he gigs as a violinist nonstop, teaches during breaks, and is most likely developing early onset alzheimer's. My dad is... well, he could help me, but his absence is the reason I can only sleep with 50 year old men. My therapist, I've recently realized, is not good at her job. My psychiatrist is great for 30 minutes a month, but I'm scared of taking anything beyond my 120mg Geodon because I've spent the last 15 months losing 70 lbs and, well, you know how it goes.

Fuck all of this. I felt genuinely hopeless today, recognizing that with my best friend not speaking to me because of a stupid drunken night, I might have fucked up the best relationship I've managed to cobble together since I first got sick when I was 14 and lost all of my friends. I don't think I'll meet someone like him again and if I've got no one... How am I supposed to do this... Any of this?",1
"Hi. 36 y/o male. Just going to throw a block of text at you from a throwaway account, hope you don't mind. 

I’m a functional drunk, occasional drug addict. Just weed, but still. I’m mentally ill. Depression, ADD. Some other stuff in there too, I guess. Full of anger, nought to sixty in half a second flat. When it gets so bad I think I could hurt someone, or want to hurt myself, I punch myself in the head. I used to box; I punch pretty hard. Damn near laid myself out, tonight, second time this month. 

This had been a good day, my daughter’s first at school. We had a fun evening, just her and me. Earlier on she was grinning, looking up at me, saying “dance with me, daddy.” The kind of memory you want to keep. 

My wife is pregnant with our second, she had a scan today, all is good. Should have been a solid good day, but it was too good to last. Our health insurance is getting changed, at short notice, and the meds that have just started working for me are probably not going to be covered. So I was stressing about that, by the time my wife got home, and I guess that spoilt her showing me the scan pics. She got pissed off, she was tired, had been at work and then the doctor’s all day. Said I was acting like an asshole, which I probably was. I can be rude when I’m stressed. I said I was freaking out at the prospect of losing the insurance, and she said I freak out about everything. 

That was it. That was enough. I got mad. She went to bed. I came downstairs, and suddenly I was punching and punching, trying to… Fuck knows what I was trying to do. Direct the anger away from her, at least. Punish myself for being such a fuckup. Beat myself numb. Show what really freaking out looks like. Not that there was anyone to see. It’s not that she doesn’t give a shit, it’s just too much for her to deal with. Not what she signed up for, as she’s told me more than once. I get that. I don’t want to snap at her, but I do. She doesn’t deserve it, she’s one of the nicest, calmest people I know, and it’s not easy, being around me. 

I wanted us to last, but I don’t know if we will. We live abroad, and breaking up would mean leaving my daughter, who I love more than life itself. I just can’t. I should have killed myself before she was conceived. Now she’s here, I have to be too. I’m not going to burden her with the lifetime of issues that would come from her father’s suicide. And God, I’m terrified of infecting her with this madness. I’ve got to show her a better way of dealing with whatever problems do eventually come her way. I don’t want her to see this part of me. There are better ways of dealing, and intellectually I know a lot of them. I just don’t always manage to put them in to practice.

Anyway. It’s late and I’m out of beer. I’m going to pop a valium and pass out. Tomorrow’s another day. Another chance. Maybe I’ll manage to get it right.

"Last year, after a really inspiring LSD trip, I got into a manic state you could say. I was super inspired to just make something, instead of receiving, to give and make. It was like I moved from child- to adulthood, from learning to doing.

To you who has not had an manic incident, well, it feels amazing. It is like being on amphetamine and MDMA at the same time. I really just had a lot of energy and felt so in touch with my feelings. Things like fear and anxiety where non-existent . So I basically just started doing a lot of stuff I wanted to do. Like taking lots of pictures and hanging out with folks. I had kind of decided on the LSD trip to just go for it, just be an artist (being an artist is the ultimate, you can rationalize everything you do as art).

So I had maybe my ultimate 10 days of my life. I had no job at this moment, and it was summer and good weather, so I was really just had a blast. I hanged a lot with a kind of friend I have, who is a man made of confidence. Like a cool guy you could say, but also a guy people tend to think is a bit crazy. 

I also met the ""girl of my life"" (who of course had been in front of my eyes the last 18 months). I think she actually became pretty into me, because I was just pure expression of emotions. So yeah, everything was super duper. 


I was acting quite crazy you could say, and did some things that some people did not like that much. F ex trying to sell my things in the city center without having permission from the city council (police came), or buying stuff to a festival I was working as a volunteer at (got sacked as volunteer after that).

Then I decided to leave the city, to go after ""my girl"" who had gone on a 3 month long vacation to her sister in another country. And since my mother was coming home from here working trip, the time had come to leave the city.

I so went to another town where I recently had been living for two years. I there went to visit my old supervisor, who I had a good relationship with, to ask if I could sleep over. Which I could, until some 3 minutes later, when he did not want me there no more. He thought I was on some kind of drugs.

The night I used on roaming the city, and sleeping a few hours in a boat in the marina. It is a bit funny I actually went into a old, closed down psychiatric ward this night. The next day I met up at my old job, I'm not 100% sure why, but it was still early in the morning and I planned on travelling further the same day.

People at my old workplace where kind of freaked out of me, I think. At least one guy got me to his doctor, I thought it was because he wanted his doctor to learn from me or something. At the doctors office I was just sitting and being observed first. But the thing is, I actually feel they in a way made me more crazy than I was. It was as I behaved to their expectations. The doctor was talking with some on the phone and said something like ""he is having grandiose thought"", which in turn led me to express even more grandiose thoughts.

Then I was moved to another room where two females (at least one was a doctor) observed me. It was in this weird room with a lots of things in it, like a piano, pencils, and things you could be creative with. I actually thought I was there to help them solve problems with the craziness in the town (I actually still think there is more craziness in this town than usual *1)

At the doctors office they decided to drive me back to my hometown (4 hour drive) in a taxi. Since I had let go of the rudder, and let the boat sail on it's own (a metaphor), I just thought it was meant to be that I was going back to my hometown and not go visit ""my girl"". There where three guys sitting in the taxi I was in, but I don't know their roles. When we got back to my hometown they drove me straight to the psychiatric hospital. When I saw where we where heading, I actually protested a bit, but I still got in at the emergency entrance. 

After a few minutes a female nurse came and then we went to the ward. At this moment I actually thought this whole thing was a big joke or something, I could not believe, not even a little bit, that they thought I was mentally sick.

I got a room at the psychiatric ward, and I was just waiting for someone to pop up and say ""surprise"". But it of course did not happen. 

I think I at this moment talked to some doctor, and they said to me that I should be here and rest, and I said okay I'll rest here for now. I then got some medications from what the doctor had set me on. I remember this one pill being bright yellow, like just super yellow (it was a melting-pill which works instantaneously). The medications got me sleeping right away. And I slept to the next day. When I woke up I was really groggy and did not feel good. My skin also got worse I thought (not sure if it actually got, but I have atopic dermatitis at a few spots on my body, and I suspected the medications made me itch myself more).

The next day I really wanted out, but they said I should still rest, and that it was a bad idea. I got more desperate and then tried to escape by throwing a chair into the window in my room, which of course did not break (the windows are quite strong). After a few minutes I was strapped to a bed. Then they wanted me to take medications, which I refused, then I said yes to half a Diazepam/Valium pill. Since I did not become calm, and refused to take any more pills. A nurse eventually came with a syringe with some mixture of medicines. From there I don't remember so much more, but looking in my journal I was strapped to a bed four times in five days (because I did not take the pills and acted crazy). Then in some kind of magical way, I found out I needed pills (read from my journal), more likely just found out resisting was not the thing to do.

The few first weeks of my hospitalization I don't remember so much. But I remember I had problems sleeping, because I had lots of nightmares (nightmares of being locked in and of not having food to eat). I got transferred to another ward, because I had not become any better. On this ward I remember I got a pink melting-pill besides the yellow one (plus some more). I was playing some board-game at this moment, and the medications made me forget which way the sun goes around the world, quite instantaneously.

After maybe a week or three (difficult to remember), I got transferred back to the first ward again. And then I came to the genius idea of pretending to take my pills, but instead of swallowing them, just store them in my mouth until I could spit them out again. The melting-pill I melted in my mouth, because I thought this would prevent the medication to be so strong (not sure if this actually is true).

When I quit my medication I could actually not be a zombie, but I still tried to pretend I was under influence. I also did not sleep almost anything at all, but I could for 8 hours pretend I was sleeping (or at least I think I pretended that for 8 hours). I also thought I could sleep while being aware, and that by having really short powernaps (a few seconds), but really often, eliminate the need for a nights sleep. I'm not sure if I did not sleep for long periods in this time, it could be that I did it.

While being home at my mother, she said I sounded so good and that I was really becoming better (this was when I had skipped drugs for a few days). I told here it was because I had started skipping the drugs, which she did not like at all (she really believes in ""the system""). I think she actually told the psychiatric ward that I had skipped the drugs. I think this was on a Friday, so there were no doctors at work in the weekend (except the one that is on guard). So I actually did not have to take any drugs at all the whole weekend (the nurses on the ward did not call the one doctor and did not strap me to a bed to get them injected). Well, I took the Valiums. I remember I actually won 2-0 when playing FIFA with one of the employees there, I was playing with a 1,5 star team against his Real Madrid (Valium is great for FIFA skills). When the Sunday came I was trying to get all the other patients with me to revolt lol. Did not go so good. And when the evening came, they called the doctor, who basically said; take these drugs or we will have to strap you to the bed and inject them. Well, I took the pills.

At this moment I ""found"" out I just had to be 100% cooperative, which was pretty effective at getting me out, because on month later I was a free man again. This was 2,5 months after I first got locked in.

When I got out I stopped taking the medications, I pretty soon felt quite miserable. The crazy thing is, that first time I smoked weed again (alone, not so good), I just wanted to go back to the ward. I think I felt quite miserable for something like 4-5 months afterwards, but I feel quite good today. Still, to be locked in, without breaking any laws, or being suicidal or a threat to others is really frightening. Maybe more is forced medication.

I am a lucky guy comparing myself to many of the others patients I met at the ward, one of them had been there for like 20 years.

If the hospitalization was good for me I'm not sure about yet, because I could have done some more bad to my economy for example (I was using money as a drunken sailor while being maniac). So that's noted down for my next manic state (which I quite hope comes).

If you ever get hospitalized at a psychiatric ward. Here is some tips to get out fast:

- Don't talk so much. Talk only about generic everyday stuff.
- Give the impression that you are super positive to the hospitalization. This is just what you need.
- Take the medications.
- Don't in any way argue with anyone, especially not the doctors, they are always right.
- Don't walk around or act crazy in any way. Try to watch TV or read a book.

And being said, the nurses who worked on the psychiatric ward I was on, really were emphatic people, who have been through a lot of the same problems. There was this old lady from Dresden, and there was this refugee from Balkan, not everyone want to work on psychiatric ward.

The problem is the doctors, that almost not are there at all, just write down what medications you are gonna get, based on the symptoms you have. I really don't believe mental illness drugs are that good for you. 

And there was a total lack of psychotherapy, it was not possible to talk to psychologist for example. The closes thing to that was this group-meeting once a week.",1
"Psychedelic mushrooms are showing overwhelming potential to mitigate anxiety and depression long term. Just from using them once.  This information is based on trials in clinical settings, not doing mushrooms clandestinely at home (as much as that may work out, it can also be dangerous if you don’t know what you’re doing).  In some cases, specific anxieties and compulsions are cured indefinitely.  There has been at least one case where 1 mushroom trip in a clinical setting permanently removed all symptoms of OCD in someone with a pretty serious case, effectively curing his OCD.  Mushrooms have also been shown to remove the fear of death in cancer patients.

https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/mushrooms-for-anxiety

If this is not an option for you, a decent (at least temporary) solution is SSRIs.  They tend to actually work better for anxiety than for depression, and are first line treatment for anxiety disorders like OCD",1

"# urgent. 

# Been using two bars over last week and a valium few days ago and yesterday, today I felt confused and began experecing concerning health issues, dizziness, anxiety etc. in congruence with the rebound syndrome. I used to have a mild problem with these so naturally im terrified of them, but also liked breifly how they made me feel.

# Concerning.

#  Would short usage like this be a cause for concern? I mean short use you wouldn't have to wean off benzos with (less) benzos, right? The only thing I have left is like 2mg of valium, I was feeling anxious earlier so I am dissolving it under my tounge, but no more.

# Surely all I am experiencing is godawful rebound anxiety without panic, correct? 1-4 days? Would strongly appreciate some advice, help.

In the morning should I also potentially ask my doc for a single sleeping tablet or benzo if I really need it.

"Hi…. Does everyone experience withdrawal symptoms from 5mg Valium to 0mg? When I am going through something particularly traumatic I use 5mg Valium to sleep at night but I don’t ever remember having severe withdrawals when I stop, just a few sleepless nights until my body readjusts.

I’m currently two weeks in to a 5mg a night run and im reading some pretty scary stuff on here about how difficult people find it even dropping 5mg to 4mg! Suddenly feeling like I should switch to melatonin tomorrow …. I was just wondering if people could share their experiences coming off of Valium from low doses? Good and bad? Thanks ",1
I already have delusions from my schizophrenia has any one ever had delusions on Valium?,1
"I just prescribed on valium and im up to read abt any good or bad experience, including any tips if u have ! this ain't my first time on benzos but never heard of valium",1
"I am anxious usually and experienced panic attacks and such but i also have adhd, what am askin is if i can take valium to ease my comedown, i dont want to feel high just at peace but since its a half life pill i am afraid my adhd meds will mix with the valium since one is a downer and the other is a upper",1
Currently one month clean for weed and on a weaning plan for Valium. Already had anxiety problems but stopping made it so much worse as people would know. Have to do a colonoscopy and the wait time will do my head in. 99.9% sure there’s nothing wrong. It was just my hemerrhoid blood made test positive. Would CBD help with the other meds for anxiety? especially if I’m weaning of Valium,1
"A pill that takes away all of your anxiety, keeps you sober, makes you feel like before you ever had anxiety, works almost instantly, lasts all day and doesn’t bother you that there’s something different about yourself. It’s a nice thought, but not a reality for most americans under 30. Medicine like that exists though. It’s in a special class of anti-anxeity drugs called benzodiazepines. They’re controlled substances and haven’t been widely prescribed since before a lot my generation reached adolescence. Say what you want about them or the long term effects but I’d rather be addicted to a drug then gamble with allergic reactions and crippling side effects of the antidepressants that keep getting thrown at me like they’re candy. 

Some background: I have OCD, not TikTok OCD, think Sheila from the TV show Shameless type of OCD. And naturally I went to a psychiatrist to get help. I was given countless drugs since then. SSRI’s, SNRI’s, Antipsychotics, antihistamines, blood-thinners, and even a fucking seizure medication. But never a benzodiazepine. I also got therapy, did CBT, TMS, and even Exposure Therapy, nothing fucking worked. Last night I had a panic attack so bad comparable to the one that cost me my job just before I started getting help and went to the ER. I tried breathing techniques, grounding myself, and even took a blood thinner to stop all of this before I embarrassed myself at the ER again. Everything failed. The doctors saw me monitored my heart rate but when my mom told him that I had OCD he did something different. He gave me Valium. I didn’t want to take it at first because drugs scare me. But after I took it about 30 minutes later, I felt like a human being. I kept flinching at things expecting anxiety, but no anxiety ever came. It took everything I feared away, left me conscious, and made me able to enjoy things like TV and warmth. Before I went to bed I almost cried knowing that this will be over tomorrow and eventually I’ll be back to my old self. Because I was given Valium I have an actual chance to get a prescription for it now, not a good chance, but a chance and that brings me some peace. Because I always knew that if they gave me the “good stuff” I’d be free from the hell that is my life, and I was right. 12 hours of peace feels amazing, not like I’m on drugs but like a sunset. It’s so sad that because a few people in the past abused these drugs, the hundreds of thousands that could benefit from the have to suffer.",1
"Hi! I've been taking valium for less than a week, im on 5mg twice a day. The first 2 days were so great, i never felt so ""normal"" in my life, i was calm and i could finally deal with everything. I was so happy something was finally working, but here we are , exactly 5 days after my initial dose and i feel unwell, i have sweaty palms, feels like my heart is racing and i feel incredibly hyper and panicky. I took all doses as instructed and i haven't taken anything else besides my prescription. Has anyone else felt like this? Have i done something? I feel so crushed, it felt so good to be able to function and now this.",1
Ive been switched from ativan to valium and since then ive been having full blown panic attacks. Its so weird i feel like valium are causing me stress more than anything,1
"So if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, I’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I’ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:

At this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down, lay on your back. If you’re sitting, sit up straight.

Once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long, so I don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you’re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. 

**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.

There really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.

Then finally…

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there’s anything you want me to expand upon. I’ll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don’t log into this account all that much, so I’m sorry if I don’t get to your comment as quickly as you’d like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Edit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues.

Edit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources.",1
"Hey guys I was wondering if this interaction is safe
I'm currently on 30mg Propranolol at night",1
So im weening off ativan and transitioning into valium and when i took it last night it gave me alot of anxiety. I took 2.5 mg thats not even alot right. I will also say i did not sleep the night before and i have been having severe anxiety for the past two weeks so i am highly sensitized. Any thoughts?,1
"I am seeing a Psych and have been diagnosed with ADHD. The diagnosis came off the back of a tough time last year where I was struggling with working from home and I used Alcohol to self medicate for too many days in a row. I needed some valium in order to counter withdrawals and stop drinking, I was able to do this in a couple of days. I have been on Vyvanse since which has been amazing at keeping me motivated and not looking to drink to counter understimulation and restlessness. I have been able to limit drinking to weekends only and mostly not binge.

Last week I had a (now uncommon) big night out and was awful the next day. The Vyvanse helped with focus, but the anxiety, restlessness and sleeplessness were back. I managed to hold out until a reasonable hour to have a few hair of the dog beers, and drank a bottle of wine before bed. The next day things were far worse and the cravings for Alcohol were back. The last thing I wanted was a drink but I was craving instant relief, and the cravings were enough to sip wine before noon. 

I have managed to get back on the straight and narrow, but did need a few drinks for a couple of days. Obviously the best thing to do would be to stop drinking or avoid binges altogether. I do have poor self control in social situations and despite best intentions, I get carried away. I don't have a constant dependence and can go days without drinking. I feel like if I had some valium on hand, I could easily get over the next day withdrawls and 1 big night wouldn't turn into 3-5 days of drinking.

I understand my Psych may be reluctant to prescribe me Valium as they can lead to addiction. I do not have a history of substance abuse outside that small period of boozing last year. I don't believe I am a risk as the anxiety is gone a day or 2 after not drinking. The initial alcohol consumption isn't to self medicate anxiety, but the subsequent consumption is. I found Valium in 5mg doses to be calming without having an over the top effect, again not something I think I would crave.

I also understand there is a risk that removing some of the consequence of drinking may lead to drinking more. I don't drink mid-week by choice and on weekends unless I am at a party etc.. I don't feel the need to drink anymore than 2-3 drinks (at which point I am fine the next day). I don't think this would lead to more drinking.

Do you think there is any chance my Psych would prescribe these for me to have in the cupboard for a rainy day? Not ideal, but they could break the potentially vicious cycle.

"My anxiety is at an all time high, and I've been prescribed beta blockers and Valium/diazepam as PRNs until I can get antidepressants.

"I have psychosis and paranoid anxiety. I found ativan worked tremendously so much so that I'm able to go back to work. I take it once every 2 days and it gives me the relaxation to work. my issue is that they won't prescribe me it for longer than 3 weeks which means I will fall back into depression. I haven't worked longer than 3 weeks in 2 years. this medication has literally changed my life and I'm not finding it addicting like they are saying. what do i do?

"i know all y'all ain't doctors or pros, ain't axing for diagnoses or what drugs should i do (although you can write) i just wanna know if you think like me. i have multiple severe anxiety disorders and trihexyphenidyl-induced pure o ocd which's hell on earth and no anxiety disorder can come close to it.

there's only ""100% certain"" diagnoses, which is confirmed by them doctors too, not by me:

* pure o ocd
* generalized anxiety disorder
* social anxiety disorder
* body dysmorphic disorder
* 4 different phobias i can't talk about

i've visited lots of different doctors for years, and ok, when it comes to ocd they do prescribe ssri's and it's obvious although ocd be relabeled years ago and be considered as anxiety disorder, but i get why they wouldn't prescribe them benzos but rather ssri's, but when it comes to them numerous anxiety disorders they never prescribe benzos. although i know long-term use of them is bad idea and its withdrawal harsher and longer than 10 other wds combined. but they always say benzos don't work for anxiety, benzos be sleep aids. i too know that they be sleep aids too but how on earth do you say that benzos ain't anxiolytics in non-abusive doses? just tell me something like ""wds hurt or tolerance builds too quick"", why on earth should you claim, even in short-term, benzos have nothing to do with anxiety cease?

they fuckin prescribe me antipsychotics and when i read shit about them they have nothing to do with anxiety but schizophrenia and psychosis. damn, got prescribed zyprexa, tried my best to find an article where author claims it has to do with anxiety but only fuckin things they treat is schizophrenia and bipolar. damn. what's wrong with benzos? how can you claim benzos ain't anxiolytics whatsoever?

"Hi all,

I am prescribed Valium for my anxiety (2.5mg) but I haven’t taken it yet because I am really scared too, but I want to be able to take it, so I can do the things I want to do still. I have fairly bad medication anxiety, I even get anxious sometimes taking Panadol.
When I was little my mum gave me a Valium tablet that was probably a high dosage when she shouldn’t have. I don’t remember it feeling bad per say but I remember it made me feel sleepy and it just felt different and strange to how my body normally felt which as an adult, it scares me to feel anything different to how I normally feel. I don’t like to feel dopey or sleepy if it’s forced by medication if that makes sense. I am hoping if some people can explain what Valium feels like and how it helped them, it might help me to work up the courage to take it when I really need it. I’d mostly be taking it when I travel, because that’s when I get the worst anxiety. So I still want to be able to be alert enough to do activities and navigate myself around. Thanks all! ",1

My dr just gave me a subscription of 50 5mg tablets. He didn't really tell me how often to take it. How long should take many last? 3 months? Do dr often re-prescribe it if it's working? ,1
"I have had GAD (diagnosed in 2000), and was prescribed an SSRI and xanax as needed 2mg/day). Well the SSRI changed several times over the years, but I never thought I had a reason to complain about alprazolam (xanax). It certainly worked as it was supposed to. But I have seen the light. Xanax is horrible (for me).

Last week I was at my pdoc, and I needed an additional script. I had gone through the 2mg/day alprazolam, and still had ten days before a refill.

For purposes of a short backstory: I am going through some extremely anxiety-inducing/exacerbating circumstances at the moment and I have never asked any of my 3 pdocs since 2000 to write an additional alprazolam prescription (or one for increased dosage), but I needed it now, and the previous 14 years of consistent and low (relatively) alprazolam dosage of 2mg/day gave me the resolve to request it (I always feel guilty for some reason). 

I think he saw the despair in my eyes and agreed without hesitation.  He wrote a script for alprazolam 3mg/day to be filled immediately, and.... just in case...for backup, he wrote another for diazepam 20mg/day—to be used only if I had some unforeseen problem filling the first (since I was already in the middle of my current, normal alprazolam prescription).

I did not want to get the diazepam filled...I knew valium was less potent, it didn't bind as tightly to the receptors, and the onset was very slow. But, unfortunately, while the pharmacist didn't have a problem, it wouldn't go through with my coverage without a prior auth.

Because cash flow right now is one of the anxiety-inducing factors in my life, I didn't want to pay cash for the xanax.  Reluctantly, I gave the pharmacist the diazepam script (which went through).

I was very worried about taking valium coming from xanax. Even at the low 2mg/day, I knew after 14 years I had a dependence already, and I did not want to add any withdrawal issues to my current high anxiety.

For the first few days, no amount of valium really reduced my stress/anxiety. I could feel the ""rebound-anxiety"" on top of it too. Even though the diazepam prescription was for 20mg/day, I was taking 40 or 50mg. Even with that high dosage of diazepam, I felt really horrible.

But by day 4 or 5, suddenly everything seemed right. Not just right—as in ""ok, this is working in lieu of xanax""—but *incredibly better*. I was down to taking a more reasonable15-20mg diazepam per day (which on a bio-equivalency scale, as most of you probably know, is a lot less than 2mg/day of alprazolam).

I was rarely feeling anxiety at any point in the day.  And at night, when I would typically think ""I should take .5-1mg xanax or I'll never sleep"", I would think, ""do I really need to take 5 mg diazepam now to sleep??""  In the past 4 nights, I have not felt I needed to (preemptively anyway)...so I get in bed...  Twenty minutes later, like (pharmaceutical) magic, I fall asleep like a (quasi-) normal person. 

Again, many here may be familiar with the insanely short half-life of xanax. I knew it too, but I didn't really ever have anything to compare it to. But I am convinced that for the past 4 or 5 years (as my anxiety has worsened) this increased anxiety wasn't simply because I was tolerant to the alprazolam...I mean, I'm sure that was part of it, but a much bigger factor was it's rapid elimination.

I feel so much better with diazepam.  I know valium isn't a panacea, and beneath it all, I still have a mild dependence on benzodiazepines, but my QOL has just gone up ten points since stopping xanax and taking valium.

So what is with the completely unnecessary stigma associated with Valium?? It does it's job far better (or with much less a nightmare rollercoaster adventure) than xanax.

This post is mostly informational... **BUT**  if anyone knows why—in the past—when I have on rare occasion suggested to my shrink that perhaps a switch to valium instead of xanax might be prudent, my pdocs would look at me like I just asked for a prescription for Dilaudid??",1
I was prescribed Valium to help with panic attacks. 5mg does absolutely nothing for me. My doc said not to drive but I don't even feel the slightest bit affected by it. Is this normal? ,1
"Has anyone had an adverse reaction to taking valium/diazepam for anxiety or a panic attack? Took half of a tablet for the first time the other day while hungover after not getting much sleep, then about 2 hours later had one of the most severe panic attacks of my life.

I want to be able to use the Valium again in future for flying etc. if needed, but now I'm even more nervous to take it again. Not finding much online and can't get into doc for another month. ",1

There are things I already discussed with her (addiction, alcohol, use when needed, etc.), but I want to know if someone with a similar experience took the chance to try benzos and if they helped with proper use

My thoughts are nonstop but I rarely experience panic attacks. I'll get stuck thinking about a certain thing for too long so I end up wasting time or doing nothing at all. Sometimes I end up changing my mind on plans because I start thinking about it too much",1
"I have had anxiety and mild depression for awhile. It’s gotten so bad to where I don’t do anything all day, all I can do is sit around, my house is a mess, every day when I wake up I have goals and inspiration on how I want my home to look and tasks I want to complete. But I just cannot do it. I got desperate recently, and I had a medication in my cabinet I got from an ER visit a year ago. It was one single pill of 10mg Valium. I decided to cut it into quarters so I took 2.5 mg. Whenever I took this I felt so NORMAL. And the effects from that small dose lasted 2 days. And I completed so many tasks around my home. It didn’t get me “high” or “elated” but I felt normal and it was all I could ever ask for….. I only have one quarter left. And I’m saving it because I know I will probably never get this medication again. I’ve tried medication doctors recommended in the past (SSRI) and they made me feel horrible and made me very afraid to take medication ever again. But the Valium on a very low dose makes me very comfortable. the problem with this is it’s a Benzo and I know that no doctor will probably ever give it to me. I don’t even want to seek help even though I desperately want it because I don’t want to go thru the horrible side effects that SSRIs give me. ",1

"I made a post a few months back on when I got Advagen Pharma 1mg Clonazepam and it tore my life apart for weeks. They didn't feel like ""sugar pills"" but the certainly weren't as effective. If I took a second, or even a third one - then it ""sorta"" felt like how Teva 1mg felt. I've been working on my doctor with this because hes had a few patients himself with the same scenario, but also some that are not. For anyone that said to you ""Its all in your head"" is full of it - because I ended up in the hospital on week 2 from what I think was a seizure. At that point my doctor said ""Thats it, I am throwing you on Ativan until we can figure this out!"" And I said ""No, I don't want that. Let's figure something else out here."" 

Firstly, Advagen Pharma is NOT the manufacturer of this medication. I received an email after sending my FDA complaint AND a phone call from someone in India??? Asking about my symptoms and I thought ""thats weird, isnt the company in NJ? Maybe they have a call center in India."" So I called their NJ offices. I have them on a recorded phone call saying to me that they in fact do make them in NJ. I even asked (and one day soon I am going to make this phone call public) ""Are they made right there in New Jersey?"" and the first woman I spoke to said ""yes it is."" With such confidence too. The second person I spoke to said their ""sister company"" is who manufactures them over in India. I said ""a \*sister\* company? Sounds more like \*a lab we contract out\*, I work in manufacturing - I wasn't born yesterday."" She continued to lie to me and say ""No, we own the company out in India making the medications."" Again, all lies. Found out (it's even written on the bottle the pharmacies get) that it's made by ""Rubicon Research LTD."" which is in where.......India! They have zero affiliation in ""ownership"" to Advagen and admitted to me that Advagen has ""contracts"" with them to make medications for them. This is not shady business by any stretch, again I work in manufacturing - but the zero transparency is whats NOT normal. I called the FDA and probably spent 2 hours on the phone with this lovely woman (made me feel different on how I look at the FDA now, she was great) and when I brought up ""Rubicon Research"" she paused and said ""oh dear..."" and im like ""That sounds pretty concerning....whats wrong?"" She went on to tell me they're one of the MANY Indian companies that have entered the US Market in pharmaceuticals after COVID that have been submitting false data for FDA approval. She was SO honest with me on how the approval process works. They'll either ask for data and formula to make sure it's on the same level as Brand Klonopin, or they will ask for the medication itself and test it themself. Which to save money, the latter isn't as often done. Alot of the times, especially from India - the data is falsified. Thus here we are. I was going to send out the pills to get them tested myself because something was clearly wrong, but according to Advagens Google Reviews, it looks like someone beat me to it. You can find the review yourself and essentially someones daughter is prescribed Clonazepam, she got the Advagen made ones, she also experienced symptoms, and this person actually worked in a testing laboratory, tested her daughters medicine and found impurities in the tablets and has been working with the FDA on a full investigation. Not just a Med-Watch thing (which is what I hope you've all been doing having a bad experience on this). So hopefully, something will change with this, but the FDA was honest - they take time. So my research was done and I had to figure out something else to do.

I was on Valium (Diazepam) in the past and decided maybe I should go back on it. It actually worked better for me, but it felt weak if I went from anxiety, to panic. I took nearly 60 mgs just to get on an airplane and still had a full blown panic attack. It just wasn't enough. So I asked my doctor lets 1) Go back on Diazepam, same dose as last time, but I want a 90 day supply. Not 30. I've been your patient for 5 years, you know I don't do drugs, drink (in excess), you know I see this as my ""medicine"" and im not prone to abuse - give me at least that so I can keep up with pharmacies to make sure way before I need a refill and a problem occurs, I can work it out before I run out. He agreed to it. and I said 2) For the panic, it wont cut it. Its not often my anxiety turns to panic but when I am in LARGE public crowds, somewhere with alot of loud noises, or going on an airplane...I need something with a kick. So he suggested a VERY small supply of Xanax. Keep a little keychain pill bottle on hand and ""break glass incase of panic"" and said to show my faith in trust, do not give it refills. I will call when I need a refill. He agreed to that aswell. Diazepam luckily is made by Teva, the Xanax is not, its made by some Indian company aswell - but apparently got FDA approval a LONG time ago so if there was any issues with them, its rectified. I have had my small Xanax supply for a month now and have yet to touch a single one, so I don't know how effective they are but I guess I will find out my next panic attack. 

Don't take my change in medication protocol to your doctor saying you want to do the same thing to avoid the Advagen issue. This is what works for ME and you need to talk to your doctor but this is what I DID that fixed my problem (if anything, it actually made it better). So if you are stuck in this Advagen rut right now, talk to your doctor to figure something else out. This problem will not go away for a while. Hopefully Teva will have orders going out soon. I know they had to push back the date to November (from the original August date), but let's see how that goes. ",1

Speaking from a person who was dumped and is depressed from it,1
"Hello 

I’m wondering if anyone has ever used both a benzo and stimulant to taper of antidepressants.

Basically, I am having the worst withdrawals ever from Pristiq. I’d favor my withdrawal off daily klonopin after 10 years over this any day. 

Anyways, I took adderall two days ago to combat the fatigue because I had a hundred phone calls to make (I have chronic illness and I have twelve specialists so yeah).

I realized I felt 100% better and I only took 20mg that day, 10 in the morning and 10 in the evening.

The next day, I had to take a .025 klonopin for an MRI. I failed the MRI and had to re-do it, but for the rest of the day my SNRI withdrawals were gone.

Yesterday I had to fuck myself up on Valium pretty bad to try the MRI the second time. I was very slow, but my brain zaps and general disorientation from the SNRI withdrawal were gone until the Valium wore off.

I can’t get ahold of my doctor until Monday, and I probably cannot ask them this because I’m not prescribed Adderall, only Klonopin… but I would like to continue 20mg Adderall one day, .025 Klonopin the next, for about 5 more days to help with my withdrawals. 

Last night, I fucking writhed around from 5am until 11am with sleep paralysis on and off, night sweating like no other, and grinding my teeth with HORRIBLE nightmares that continued each time I convinced myself to go back to sleep during the paralysis.

I’ve experienced SP my whole life randomly and have always deduced it to stress, and the most frequent it was, I was actually convinced was some glitch in the matrix because it happened at the same minute every day and went away when I moved from that bedroom to another home. But I’ve never experienced it for 6 hours straight… it was horrifying.

Sorry for venting a bit, but I’m really hoping someone can chime in on this being a possibly beneficial plan because I’m not up to date on the receptors at play because I haven’t been on psychotropic medication regularly in a very long time, and I’ve been off benzos for over a year. I’m on gabapentin 100mg 2x a day to combat anxiety, nerve pain and help taper off the Pristiq, but it’s not doing jack shit for the latter and only adding to my fatigue. It does help the anxiety tremendously, and I feel that I will never need benzos again except severe situations (like the brain MRI).

But for the taper I truly think that one day of a long-lasting benzo like Klonopin, and one day of a short-acting stimulant like Adderall should be a good taper method? I’m wondering if this is actually a safer way to taper patients with medication experience under their belt, because the risk of getting physically addicted to either substance during the taper could essentially be lower. I’m definitely not into daily drug use and have even been sober for alcohol for a while now, so I’m not worried about the addiction potential personally - but couldn’t the Adderall help boost the serotonin levels temporarily and the benzo help with any anxiety / sleep issues?

Thanks for anyone who read all of this and any input would be great!! I hate messing around with medications but the Pristiq withdrawals are the most insane thing I’ve experienced… 😭 I was an avid psychedelic user when I was younger and the trauma from a bad trip is barely worse than this!!!",1
"ive just started a two week prescription of klonopin while im adjusting to lexapro and i’ve noticed it makes me extremely forgetful and clumsy. it’s basically like my body is drunk but my mind is just kinda stupid. i have chunks of “lost time” where i have absolutely no memory of what i was doing or where i went, even though i know i did. it definitely helps with my anxiety but my body feels so heavy",1
"I've spent a lot of time on this sub and thought that I would finally make a post to ask for some advice. Sorry in advance for the long read. 

I am just about to turn 20 and have been struggling with my mental health for the past 12 years of my life. Most of this was due to bullying at school which lead to me attempting suicide twice at the age of 8. This led to me being hospitalised twice, once for a mental breakdown which resulted in me getting sedated which was done by having about 6 people holding me down and injecting me with what I now know was diazepam. The other hospitalisation was due to me trying to jump out my window and so I was kept in hospital for 3 days. The other attempt was a few days after leaving hospital and I had a breakdown which resulted me laying down in flood water in December and just giving up until my dad found me. This lead me to suffer from severe social anxiety and an attachment disorder with my parents where I got incredibly anxious about leaving them. This lead to me moving schools and having severe anxiety going into school every day until high school which often resulted in me crying and breaking down. I then suffered from lots of bullying as well from the ages of 11-16 which has left a lot of deep insecurities on me regarding basically everything about me. I was called names and picked on for almost every feature about me including height, weight, name, personality, being weird and probably anything else you can think of. 

Edit: I also began losing weight at 16 due to bullying about my weight which lead me to develop issues with food though I am not sure if it would be a clinical eating disorder. I still suffer from anxiety and stress about food and especially my weight. I have a lot of issues with my body image despite being in objectively good shape and have received compliments about my appearance. I get really in my head about food and have absolutely no structure when it comes to eating except that I try to eat a fairly low processed food and carb diet. 

Another bit of information is that I have suspected for a while that I may be autistic since I have lots of sensory issues as well as struggles feeling emotions such as empathy and picking up on social cues and understanding people. I have also experienced autistic meltdowns fairly often where I get overwhelmed and often result in head banging to stop myself from thinking. I also have always been very obsessive and get new hyper fixations which generally last for a few months until I begin to lose the level of interest in them though it never fully goes. 

Due to all of this I have been borderline suicidal for most of my life and the last year and a half has been particularly bad since leaving home to go to university and at one point was self medicating with alcohol. In the last few months my mental health has taken a turn for the worst and had a bad mental breakdown/autistic meltdown at Christmas and tried to wrap and elastic cord round my neck. After that I began looking at options for therapy, which I have now started, mostly pushed by my parents and girlfriend but also got really hyper focused on psychiatry. I have also been referred for a diagnosis for Autism. 

In my research I came across OCD and I believe that I have that specifically pure-O as I have always had a lot of trouble with disturbing intrusive thoughts, rumination for hours and hours about things that caused me anxiety. Reading in the r/OCD sub made so much of my life make sense to me and why I act the way that I do. I have also obsessively researched into antidepressants to try and find out all the information that I could on it in. 

At the end of March I started the SSRI Citalopram (Celexa) at 10mg which took a about a week to start causing side effects which were: sharp increase in anxiety, apathy to food, fatigue, insomnia, hyperactivity, trouble focusing, increased sensory problems, jitteryness/restless leg syndrome, increased suicidal ideation and mental breakdowns/autistic meltdown. After a month of this medication during a mental breakdown I attempted to kill myself by strangling myself with dressing gown cord. 

Due to this I then went back to my GP the next day and got my medication swapped to the SSRI Sertraline (Zoloft) at 50mg which I have now been on for 10 days. I was also given 6 Diazepam (Valium) at 5mg for when I get really overwhelmed. 

Since being on Sertraline I have been struggling exceptionally with focus and sitting and in research as to why I found that ADHD can be exacerbated by SSRIs which would explain the uptick in my symptoms from starting when I began taking them. When reading up on ADHD I realised that I have been suffering from symptoms of this for years where I always struggled with concentration on tasks that did not interest me, did poorly in exams, engaged in risky behaviours, only could work when stressed and deadlines approaching, always fiddling with something, feeling the urge to climb and do pull ups on scaffolding, issues with impulsively speaking, had to be walked like a dog when a young child due to endless energy and chronic procrastination.

I was never considered for ADHD as I always performed well in school in maths and science but much worse in the subjects that did not interest me. I was also fairly well behaved due to my social anxiety being quite debilitating at times. 

So that is my backstory up to the present and here is where I am at the moment. My plan is to come off the Sertraline basically cold turkey as I have only been on it for a short amount of time and am on a very low dose. Then I am trying to get diagnosed for ADHD and then try some medication for that to see how that helps me with my inattention and hyperactivity. After that I will then antidepressants again to help me with my depression, anxiety and OCD. I plan to try the SSRI Fluvoxamine (Luvox) as it seems to be better for OCD and has a nicer side effect profile without any major drug-drug interactions with ADHD medication. 

If anyone reads this I would really appreciate any advice you could give me on my plan and any tips to help.",1
"I‘m 23 now, suffering from severe and treatment resistant depression since I was 15. When I was 17 I first called a professional cause I knew there wasn‘t something right with me and this suffering isn‘t normal. It mainly all started being surely problematic with 17 but the symptoms probably even started with 10 or earlier, at least I can think of similar symptoms back in these times.

So I called the doc at 17 alone first time, letting no one else know, and I got treatment. Now, 23, I‘m over 14 different medications and 3 talk therapies (psychotherapeutical depth psychological as well as CBT) all without NO success. I‘m now 23 and just got off Mirtazapine and Wellbutrin 1 week ago. Also I got off Kratom at the same time (started using he Kratom cause no treatment worked).

I now lay in bed since Saturday, doing nothing, can‘t eat, can‘t drink, can‘t move. I even quit my job on Friday. Still studying my master (have a bachelor at least already). But I just feel hell as shit now and don‘t know anything to do, I dont see any hope or any future. My cognition is also very bad, I feel like the dumbest and most worthless human. I lay way behind everyone else in my age regarding knowledge or skills, let‘say any professional knowledge but also about any sports (like following professional soccer, basketball or even playing it), I dont have any knowledge about anything, sports, cars, professions, sciences, literature, anything.

My doc just prescribed me Lithium now as next trial for medication. She told me to start taking it on Tuesday. I still didnt‘t start taking it cause I only can read it using for bipolar, never ever any studies or such for depression itself (without mania) or social anxiety and rn I just survived the day by drinking 3 beers, not eating anything or drinking more than a glass of water. I feel retarded, sad, socially incapable and dumb and no clue how to go on. Life has nothing to offer for me, it‘s such a big draining unsurvivable feeling of sadness and being imcapable.

Thinking about suicide and hosted psychiatry many times but also just looking for a quick fix as other people my age and „friends“ just live so happily and have their way rn so I dont wanna be the crazy guy being in a psychaitric wardness, especially as Id how it would help me after these many faile treatments.

Any ideas? I really tried everything you could think off.

"Is it normal to be prescribed latuda for anxiety/depression? I read that it’s mainly used for schizophrenia and bipolar but I don’t have either one of those. I have anxiety/panic disorder, depression and PTSD but I was recently just diagnosed with ptsd bc of my dad’s unexpected death. My doctor also THINKS but isn’t positive yet that I may have border personality disorder. But he said he is giving me latuda for my anxiety and depression so is it normal for it to be prescribed for those? And is anyone else on latuda for anxiety and depression as well? Oh and also I’m currently on 300 mg of Effexor and 10mg Valium at night",1
"Hi, so my psychiatrist just changed my meds and prescribed me paroxil cr 25 mg, a tablet each night. Firstly, I’m scared because all the “common” side effects are the same, or pretty similar to what serotonin syndrome is. I’m scared to go to sleep. I’m scared to see myself in the mirror and see my pupils dilated. I know this medicine is supposed to help me but *I’m scared* . My doctor also prescribed me with Ativan, but my disordered brain is tricking me into thinking that if I take it now, I won’t know for sure if the Paroxil is bad for me. So I want to take it by itself and see its effects before I take anything else. It’s late at night so obviously I can’t message my psychiatrist, but each minute that passes my anxiety is only going up. I don’t want to obsess with the side effects and trick my mind into thinking I have them. But it’s *so goddamed difficult*",1
"And like Im losing my mind. On trintellix 5 mg for the past 4 weeks, from lexapro .  Also on wellbutrin 150. Im going out of my mind with all these mood swings , up and down down and up . Today is a paritcularly BAD day. Woke up and was hyper and manic, now Im so flat that I cant even get through my day without struggling. IM not bipolar,  I have MDD and GAD . Not sure if this is the withdrawal still from lexapro, or just my body trying to adjust to trintellix or what, but I feel like leaving work and lying in bed and not having to deal wiht anyone or anything-yet at the same time im extremely lonely. This sucks",1
"I suffer from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old (symptoms occured even before but with 15 I started noticing it very clearly, with 17 I first started going to a psychiatrist and therapist). Now I'm 23 and tried 3 different forms of therapies as well as over 14 different types of meds. Nothing helped so far, nothing reduced my symptoms. It's now called treatment resistant depression and even my doc says normal therapy is not effective for my type of depression, it definitely is caused biochemically/neurologically/biologically.

Except for my very last one: Lyrica. Lyrica helps at least a bit and makes my anxiety and depression a bit better. But I know Lyrica can cause dependance and horrible withdrawal as well as tolerance, so best would be to not use it daily but only as rarely as possible. I don't want to use any substance daily at all anyways, cause I've been through many horrible withdrawals. Hence my plan of cycling substances, meds, supplements, whatver to finally have a painless life.

My doc wanted to try every possible med left with me, so she's very open for new meds, which I'm too. She mentioned Tianeptine to try on me soon as - as said - Im trying my 15th med now without success or symptom reduction, for years, 2 depth psychological (analytical) and 1 cognitive behavioral therapy failed to help. I also do sports weekly (tennis and/or gym, skiing sometimes).

I might just take it if needed then, even if she prescribes it for daily. I mean, if it‘s an opioid and one says even harder to get off than oxy… Maybe if needed same as my Lyrica so one can switch them to reduce risk of tolerance/dependance/withdrawal of each. A 3rd med of different class would still be better to have a good cycle and get maybe at least 3, maybe even 5, worthful to live days and free of suffering days a week. 2 days completely off then.

Any idea? Lyrica is gabapentinoid = calcium channels, a teeny bit of GABA receptors itself too. Tianeptine is opioid = opioid receptors. What else could be added but not using the same receptor or system? What about Buspirone, Hydroxyzine, Clonazepam? So far I only have found Lyrica & Kratom to be helpful (even if it's not ""curing"" me, just making my day and symptoms by maybe 20-50% better, but only if not taken daily - hence the need for a cycle and not taking any similar chemical daily)

As I don't want to use any similar chemical daily or many days in a row or a week at all and in the best case only one neurotransmitter/CNS system once a week max, I thought about cycling following, each one only once a week to reduce any risk of possible dependance, withdrawal or tolerance:

**Voltage gated calcium channels (Gabapentionoid):**

* **Lyrica (Pregabalin)** => said to don't have much GABAergic affinity on its own, rather acts indirectly and weakly on GABA, hence hess less risk of cross tolerance with GABAergics (if I should add any GABAergic as a benzo to my cycle, too)

**Opioidergic:**

* **Tianeptine** (opiodergic antidepressant)
* **Kratom** (legal opioidergic plant) => question is, how strong would the cross-tolerance with Tianeptine be if used with a break of many days in between as both are opiodergic afaik?

**GABA:**

* Benzodiazepine => Valium/Diazepam didn't work so I told my doc to quit my script for it as I don't find any use for it => a friend of mine with very similar symptoms had great experience with Clonazepam instead

**Dopamine and/or Norepinephrine:**

* **Ritalin**
* **Adderall**
* **Modafinil**
* or similar AD(H)D stimulant medication
* => big issue: I guess I only have a 10% chance of getting any of these stimulant AD(H)D meds cause even if I strongly suffer from symptoms very similar to ADD (without the H for hyperactivity) no doc ever wanted to test me for ADD as long as my depression and anxiety weren't cured, that's why I never got a diagnosis until now and now docs tell me, you can mainly only get a diagnosis for ADD if it has been diagnosed in the childhood or when one has been very young, also one had to have very bad grades in school for one of the diagnosis checks => so my school grades have only been medium bad, not very bad + I'm now 23 and maybe a bit too late for school medicine to hop on the ADD train even if I always had the thought of suffering from ADD cause of my very bad cognitive symptoms (focus, memory etc.) + ADD goes hand in hand with depression and anxiety and might be a cause of these symptoms afaik (so why the hell no doc ever tested me for it before trying to always continue treating me with typical depression therapy and meds instead of giving the ADD train a go???)

**Other psychiatric medication** (with need of a prescription by my doc) I thought of to add to cycle for the other left days in my week full of suffering that may be helpful for finally making my life painless and livable:

* **Hydroxyzine**
* **Buspirone**
* **Lamictal**
* **Abilify**
* **Amisulpride**
* **Selegiline**
* any other ideas? as said my doc is really open to try new meds with me cause she knows how desperate and treatment-resistant I am and have been for years now

**OTC meds/supplements/herbs** I thought of to add to cycle for the other left days in my week full of suffering that may be helpful for finally making my life painless and livable:

* **Kava:** legal anxiolytic plant, had some good experiences with it reducing my symptoms strenghts, being anxiolytic and antidepressant BUT it's a big hit and miss, causing skin issues for me (when taken some days daily in a row) and very expensive, hence surely also nothing to take daily => ALSO: there's not much science about rather it's **GABAergic** or also rather a **voltage gated calcium channel blocker (VGCC blocker)** as Lyrica, or how it really works, but it's said to not have any physical dependance or withdrawal issues or risk => question again, is there any cross tolerance with Lyrica or Benzodiazepines?
* **DXM (Dextromethorphane): dissociative antitussive** => originally a cough medicine, now officially used for depression and I already read years ago many times about people using it to self medicate their depression and anxiety in non-trip-doses (cause some people abuse it in mega-doses to get a psychedelic trip from it, which I never planned or wanted to)
* **Kanna (Sceletium tortuosum): natural SSRI** => sadly never noticed any effects from it when I tried the plain herb as well as extract orally or sublingually in low to medium dosage (some swear on having to take it intranasally to get antidepressant/anxiolytic effects but I already hate the thought of having to take something through my nose)
* Gotu Kola => seems to help a bit, might be good for my ""off-days"" off ""real stronger medication""
* Lemon Balm => seems to help a bit, might be good for my ""off-days"" off ""real stronger medication""
* Beta Alanine => some studies promise anxiolytic effects because of it's GABAergic properties

Some probably very weak herbs having no sense to try for my severe treatment-resistant depression and social anxiety:

* Tongkat Ali => testosterone increasing, read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety
* SAM-e => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety
* Bacopa => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety
* Lions Mane Mushroom => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety
* KSM-66 (Ashwagandha) => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety BUT tried one KSM-66 product from Amazon for more than 2 weeks daily and never had success with it or any symptom reduction sadly...
* Taurine => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety BUT never worked for me, maybe I have to increase dosage to a mega dose?
* L-Theanine => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety BUT never worked for me, maybe I have to increase dosage to a mega dose?
* Silexan/Lasea (Lavender extract) => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety BUT never worked for me even after trying it for more than 2 weeks daily
* Rhodiola Rosea extract => read some reviews about people having success with it for depression and/or (social) anxiety BUT never worked for me even after trying it for more than 2 weeks daily as well as only as needed
* Akuamma
* Wild Lettuce
* Skullcap
* Mulungu
* Passion flower
* GABA (plain powder supplement of GABA, infamous for not crossing the BBB so not being able to have any psychoactive effects)

Sure, last resort for me is also still:

* stronger MAOIs as Nardil or Parnate (I already tried the weaker MAOI ""Moclobemide""/""Aurorix"")
* Ketamine therapy
* rTMS
* ECT",1
"I don’t know if this is to vent or what but here goes. 
First time poster. I am a 35 year old male and was diagnosed with MDD as a 15 year old. I was given Zoloft and all was well. For some unknown reason, the family doctor switched all of us (My whole family has clinical depression to varying degrees) to Effexor XR when I was 19. Still, it controlled my depression so I was fine with it. 
In 2015 I caught a really, REALLY severe case of Viral Meningitis that caused severe encephalitis. All my EEGs were wildly abnormal and I was completely nuts, totally out of touch with reality. This experience completely fried my brain. They never discovered the identity of virus that caused the infection but I was hospitalized for over a month while my medical team hoped the virus would clear and the swelling around my brain would normalize. It eventually did and I was discharged home. The recovery out of the hospital was worse than my scattered memories of my time in the hospital. I physically could not fall asleep and after three weeks of begging was finally given Trazadone (thank God) along with my steady stream of my newly prescribed opioid pain killers and Valium. Over the next two months I slowly recovered from the worst of it. I got off the opioids but still take trazadone to this day. I went back to work and tried to begin life again. 

However, I was not the same person I was before the meningitis. Anxiety (which had never been a problem for me before) joined my depression, which sadly was no longer responding to the Effexor. I found a great psychiatrist and we have tried almost everything with no effect. Welllbutrin, Zoloft again, Seroquel,Mirtazapine, Lamictal, Pramipexole, Lexapro, pretty much everything under the sun. The next two years was just a roller coaster of meds and shitty side effects. I eventually was given Xanax which at least kept me functional despite the fact I am completely chemically dependent on it now. I did a whole round of TMS and felt nothing. I am now classified as “Treatment Resistant.”

My psychiatrist is frustrated and said to me that beyond a few more drugs and possibly MAOIs, ECT is where we are headed. I am not against ECT but I am absolutely just exhausted fighting this battle. It’s been seven years living like this. I make it to work and excel there but I feel like I have withdrawn from life. I was always the social butterfly but now I just sleep my weekends away. I recently started going back to therapy and am doing ketamine infusions but I just feel stagnant and I can’t see myself doing this forever. I don’t want to die but I definitely don’t want to continue living like this. 

In addition to my Effexor, Trazadone and Xanax my psychiatrist just prescribed me Caplyta, which is relatively new and based on what I have read, used primarily for Bipolar Depression. I pray to God it works because I don’t want to just exist anymore. I want to get back to living my life. 

Does anyone have positive experiences with ECT? Is there something I have missed? I feel like I am running out of road here. Any outside insight would be welcome.",1
so my Dr is wondering what to put me on after psychosis I have bipolar and ocd I've been on 60mg prozac for couple years and I built a tolerance for it but haven't heard anything about this because it's rare I'm on 10mg and it's making me hallucination and having delusions..... never would think it could happen any stories of this happening and have to switch medications and what helped,1
"Memory loss is a common topic within the mental health world. I'm an RN that works in Mental Health & going to do my best to summarize some research on *which* mental health medications impact our memory and *why* they do.

**Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs**

**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**

Drug class

This is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain. Over 10% of the US takes an SSRI.

What Do SSRIs Do?

What does every medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, you’re blocking the neurons from reabsorbing Serotonin, meaning there is more Serotonin available.

So what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.

Did You Know?

Serotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. While we can measure the levels in our blood we cannot measure the levels within our brain. Meaning we’re all in the dark as to how much is within our brain and whether or not it’s even correlated to the amount in our blood.

How SSRIs Impact Memory

Age and gender do not seem to influence the data that SSRIs are correlated with memory effects. Something that is important to mention, is that while research has shown that SSRIs are *correlated* with memory loss, that doesn’t exactly mean that they CAUSE it. Correlation and cause are two different things. Many people that take SSRIs also take benzodiazepines, drink, smoke, have genetic predisposition to memory loss, etc. Depression and anxiety themselves can even cause memory problems.

Summary

So, after reading through many articles, there overall wasn’t enough credible information to emphatically say that an SSRI causes memory loss. In fact, I came across more research that suggested SSRIs improve cognitive performance and memory. Some data also specifically supported that SSRI’s can improve memory for patients experiencing psychosis and depression.

**Tricyclic Antidepressant  | TCAs**

**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**

Drug Class

The word “tricyclic” refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed before SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays. TCAs are still often administered for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.

What do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?

What do all TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors. These key differences create a cascade of effects in the body that do impact memory. These key differences are also the culprit for the common side effects in this drug class like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.

Did You Know?

In 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 ( a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new 'invention' was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.

How TCAs Impact Memory

There are multiple reasons why a TCA impacts our memory. **The first reason** is that we retain memory best when norepinephrine is released at an optimal rate. These drugs block the reabsorption of norepinephrine; which is known to be a moderator of memory. With too much of it, we are anxious and stressed, too little of it and we are drowsy and not as coherent. Either way, the drug has an impact on norepinephrine which directly influences how we store memory.

**The second reason** why this drug class impacts memory is because it competes with our natural antagonists on muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is well documented that these drugs block muscarinic receptors (which is an acetylcholine receptor), and acetylcholine directly impacts learning and memory.

>*“Muscarinic* acetylcholine *receptors* in the hippocampus and cortex underlie *memory* formation”

Summary

So, TCAs are a drug that research has linked with memory impairments and dementia. These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life (even could improve memory if their extreme anxiety was impairing it), while for another it can make them drowsy and leave a bad impression.

\*Note each drug within the class impacts the degree of these effects a little differently.

**Benzodiazepines**

**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**

Drug Class

These are commonly considered anti-anxiety medication (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.

Let’s taco ‘bout it.

This drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which slows down our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).

Did You Know?

Anesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?

How Benzodiazepines Impact Memory

This drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is advantageously quick acting, the effects linger.  Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.

This is why a rehab center isn’t going to allow the use of 'said drug' while ‘recovering’. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking 'said drug' while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning & you're not able to remember anything, how can you work on it? The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.

Now, don't shoot the messenger. Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They're an actual life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with *repeated* use we will need *increasingly* higher doses, making the dent in your memory more and more indisputable.

Full Disclosure

My mother was an addict, benzodiazepines being her drug of choice.

Do you know an addict whose drug of choice is a benzodiazepine? No SHAME, but if so, you can probably attest that **they don’t remember shit.** 

How about an addict whose drug of choice is alcohol? All love here, but you can say for certain, *they don’t remember shit*.

There has even been a fair amount of data to support that the risk of Alzheimer’s is elevated in those taking the drug for over 6 months. One Harvard study even speculated that it would raise the risk by 84%! Seems unrealistic, but who am I to question Harvard; I'll add the link below if you're also feeling speculative.

Another point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.

This is often what is referred to as *“rebound anxiety”*  because your anxiety is likely to get worse, before it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken long term.

Take it from a nurse who works in mental health; it's not enjoyable being the bystander of a patient trying to escape their benzo addiction.

But this is why the mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time.

Now, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please don’t go flush yours down the toilet after reading this.

When Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is that we’re now in a benzo addiction crisis. We’re learning over time, as a society and those changes don’t happen overnight. And trust me, as a mental health professional I myself occasionally grow infuriated at the amount of family doctors who prescribe copious amounts of benzodiazepines only to later turn the patient away after addiction has crippled them.

**Anti-Epileptics**

**topiramate, topamax, zonisamide, zonegran, levetiracetam, keppra, pregabalin, lyrica, clonazepam, klonopin, rufinamide, banzel, vigabatrin,  sabril, phenytoin, dilantin, oxcarbazepine, trileptal, carbamazepine, tegretol, lamotrigine, lamictal, lacosamide, vimpat, valproic acid, depakote, phenobarbital, gabapentin, neurontin**

Drug Class

Anti-seizure medications are commonly used for mood disorders and even anxiety in addition to epilepsy.

What Do They Do?

Epilepsy is caused by **excessive** hyperexcitability of the nervous system therefore, medications in this class are geared toward minimizing excitability. This drug class actually encompasses three different major classes

1. Blocking Sodium Channels
2. Enhancement of GABA Inhibition
3. Regulation of Synaptic Releases

Why it Impacts Memory

Overall, anticonvulsants work in different ways; trust me I rode the magic school for HOURS trying to gain an understanding of them to write this. Truthfully, we still have a lot to learn about them. Their impact is complicated and the effects range based on the dose and drug.

For instance, Topamax has pretty diverse pharmacologic actions, because of that, it **has** been linked with impaired concentration, cognitive dulling, psychomotor retardation, language and comprehension difficulties, rather extreme effects on short-term memory and working memory, poor verbal fluency and word-finding, reduced IQ scores, abnormal thinking and delayed cognitive speed. Because of this dark cloud of side effects, Topamax is sometimes referred to as 'Dope-A-Max'.

However, a more selective medication within the drug class such as Phenytoin or Tegretol are more specific to blocking sodium channels. Overall, they seem to have less impact on memory and cognitive function.

Many of these drugs listed above have an impact on GABA, and long term exposure to GABA agents can alter the functionality of GABA permanently, which means there are potentially permanent consequences to cognition, behaviors, and memory.

Phenobarbital has been linked to lower IQ, and worse effects than Depakote and Tegretol, however it is actually a barbituate. It’s effects are similar to benzodiazepines which you can read more about above.

Gabapentin, used for seizures and often mood disorders, belongs to it's own drug class. Still, it **has** been linked to memory impairment. Hence, the name, it also impacts GABA, which as mentioned several times now, certainly plays a hand in our ability to remember. At this point there isn’t enough research to say it’s linked to dementia though.

As far as drugs for epilepsy, Gabapentin is tolerated much better than many others. It’s also worth mentioning that this drug seems to have more *short term* effects on memory. Some will experience a disorienting feeling or short term memory loss while taking Gabapentin, but the reports of long term memory being impacted are reported less often.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Antipsychotics**

**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics; risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**

Drug Class

Commonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome & Huntington's disease

What Do They Do?

Most drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.

Did You Know?

Oddly enough, memory seems to actually be improved when using an antipsychotic for a person with psychotic symptoms, though there are many that take medications within this class that are not psychotic. So let's talk about that more.

Why It Impacts Memory

First, let's skip back to the purpose of these drugs. Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it's to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.

This class is broken up into two categories;

**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which do impact the complex way in which we store memories. \*More movement disorders come with the old ones.

**Second Generation: (new, atypical):** Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors\*\*.\*\* Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.

What do they all have in common? **They impact Dopamine.** Long story short; A delicate balance of Dopamine is needed for memory to function. Since this class targets Dopamine, it's fair to say it has the potential to alter our memory. Whether that's a good or bad thing is specific to the patient, but it's typically an unwelcome effect.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Antihistamines**

**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom,  hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan,  triprolidine, triafed**

Drug Class

Commonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different 'generations' & target different histamine receptors in our body.

* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body
* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion
* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System
* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched

What Do They Do?

We're actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that \*\*anti-\*\*histamines are usually anticholinergic; **blocking** receptors for choline. The problem is that we need choline to be readily available to have the ability to learn, understand and remember.

Why it Impacts Memory?

Being that antihistamines are often anticholinergic, they do impair our ability to think, learn and remember. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain. We already naturally produce less acetylcholine overtime. This is partly why as we age our ability to remember, think, and learn diminishes. It's widely known that anticholinergics impact memory, thinking, learning, and muscle function. It is also suggested that these drugs increase the risk of developing dementia.

Did you know?

The only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways in addition to the reason why it's administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much less specific in their effects, they are affiliated with greater memory impairment. Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings.

Summary

Overall, the effects range. Regarding mental health specifically; Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax are commonly prescribed for anxiety. While your risks are much less severe than benzodiazepines, these are FIRST generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this is also means they do impair our ability to remember.

An example of second generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won't do you much good.

i desperately wanna sleep and took 5mg of klonopin and i wanna take 50mg of trazadone but idk if it’ll make me sick,1
"I just got off Mirtazapine cold turkey  like 2 weeks ago. Off Kratom since Friday, 9 December, had a relapse yesterday. I started using Lyrica (Pregabalin) on Sunday, 11 December, to combat and go through the withdrawals. I took it from Sunday to Friday last week. So 5 days in total, mostly 150mg in the morning, two days another 150mg in the evening. It really helped me to still go to work, be able to finish my tasks, and get out of bed or my apartment. I still suffer badly but it's the only thing that really helps me do something, get out of bed, and have way less social anxiety (still shy and introvert but way less antisocial and anxious, more talkative, esp no physical anxiety like shakes anymore). I took it these 5 days, then 2 days off (last Saturday and Sunday), then today again 150mg in the morning + 100mg in the evening as I had a university essay and a presentation today. It helped. I even think about going to the gym now, I managed to eat one whole meal so far, which is great.

My doc even prescribed me lyrica for daily use or whenever i need it but I never have been taking it more than once every one or two weeks as I was and still am horribly anxious about lyricas own dependance and withdrawal that can be bad according to some people. And that using it regularly just makes my condition worse in the end and offers me another bad withdrawal time that puts me even deeper to the ground of deep depression.

As I suffer more than anytime, probably because of withdrawing from Kratom AND Mirtazapine (while I thought Mirtazapine has no severe withdrawal, might also only be the kratom withdrawal), and I don't eat (lost 5kg/10lbs in these 2 weeks), I don't sleep and feel very fucked, insane, can't move much or do anything functional, I was wondering if it would be the best to just go back on Mirtazapine. But otherwise I'm very happy and proud that I got off Mirtazapine and don't have to take it daily anymore. I just don't know what to do. I know lyrica would help me if I continue taking it. But I also know there can be harsh withdrawal for many people who take Lyrica daily. Mirtazapine might have withdrawal, too and maybe I should just use this opportunity to finally get off Mirtazapine (which even didn't help my depression much, did nothing for my social anxiety, BUT it made me eat and sleep which can contribute to improving depression). Mirtazapine is the 14th med Im trying now, without much or any success. Life still has been a daily pain and suffering since trying these meds and 3 different psychotherapies for 5 or more years now.

What would you do in my position? Get on the lyrica train as many do and swear on but also many suffer from withdrawing in the end? Get back on Mirtazapine and hope to be better in one or two weeks, finally eating and sleeping again, and getting back on my weight (I always was skinny but now am really thin cauese of not being able to eat or drink at all).

Also my doc just prescribed me Lithium (as my 15th med to try plus 30mg Mirtazapine - my doc doesnt know that I quit it) on last Monday but as I don't suffer bipolar depression and I couldn't find any information or studies for Lithium being succesful for unipolar depression or social anxiety (which is my biggest source of depression) I just hesistated to take it until now.

Otherwise I also have many supplements left I still wanted to try and had hope that they can be finally ""heal"" me. Lavender extract, Bacopa, Rhodiola Rosea extract, SAM-e, Dopa Mucuna, Lemon Balm, Gotu Kola extract, Magnolia Bark extract, GABA (not bought yet but maybe was thinking of: Kanna, Lions Mane Mushroom, DXM low dose, Polygala, Tongkat Ali?). Can any of these be helpful for my withdrawal and depression and social anxiety even if 14 pharmaceutical meds didn't help?

It's hard to decide which way to go as all of these meds need time to work and I don't have the time or ability to suffer that long until I know if a med or supplement works or if it does not.

* Lithium seems so unuseful for my issues as there are only studies using it for bipolar, but I don't have bipolar depression, still my doc sees a reason why she prescribed it to me, I guess, as next trial after 14 failed meds and 3 failed psychotherapies. I just don't see the reason as there is no science I can find behind it.
* I could take Mirtazapine and I know I'd probably start eating and sleeping again in 1-2 weeks thanks to Mirtazapine but otherwise I think I might get dependent on it (Idk if this is withdrawal from Mirtazapine or Kratom or both, but if it's Mirtazapine too, I'd be better now off of it than prolonging the use and withdrawal of Mirtazapine).
* I surely won't touch Kratom again for a while as I've really been dependent on it, and it just fucks with my mental health after one week daily use and I also don't eat on it to get effects on empty stomach 24/7. It just isn't worth using it daily and I have to take a looong break from it until I can start using it like once a week max. Because I know when I only used it once a week it was effective and giving me good results but daily use just worsens my state a lot.
* I could continue Lyrica, with the very high risk for dependence and withdrawal when  trying to quit it one day but I know it works for my social anxiety better than any med before, even if it's only a little lift. Otherwise many use it daily as no other meds worked and they just pay the price for a bit of life quality and one day going off of it with bad withdrawals and maybe long-term damage (?). How's your experience with Lyrica as therapeutical daily use for depression and social anxiety? Ever tried to get off of it? Is it possible or a very bad idea to use it daily even if it's the only thing helping a bit?
* I could try any of the above mentioned supplements I still haven't tried (I tried many others before without success but maybe you have some other supps that helped you with treatment-resistant depression and social anxiety when no other even strong pharmaceutical meds didn't help. but at that point I also think, if strong pharmaceutical meds couldn't help me or treat me right, how could a supplement do?)
* I could ask for another medication than Lithium. I will surely tell my doc that I hesistated to try Lithium until now as I couldn't find any studies on it for my issues anywhere and was overthinking of going on another med again, just failing, having no success and maybe side effects and withdrawal of it for no success or effects in contrary. What meds could I still try if 14 meds didn't work?

I already tried these meds and no one treated my depression and social anxiety, not even touched it except for Mirtazapine enabling me to eat more and sleep better:

* Escitalopram (Cipralex)
* Promethazine
* Venlafaxine (Effexor)
* Quetiapine (Seroquel)
* Sertraline (Zoloft)
* Opipramol
* Paroxetine (Paxil)
* Duoloxetine (Cymbalta)
* Moclobemide (Aurorix) (weakest MAOI)
* Amitriptyline
* Gabapentin
* Diazepam (Valium)
* Mirtazapine (Remeron) => makes me eat and sleep, probably lil effective cause of helping with that
* Bupropion (Wellbutrin)
* Pregabalin (Lyrica) => lil effective

All no success. Plus 2 depth psychological psychotherapies and 1 cognitive behavioral therapy, all failed, too. No success.

Still open to try, some meds I just noted some days I was desperated and surfing through the web for alternatives and relief:

* Ketamine (any experiences? also expensive and hard to find where I live)
* Psilocybin (Magic Mushrooms) (have big anxiety of horror trips and psychosis etc., also illegal here)
* Ayahuasca (maybe in a south american treatment center but hella expensive)
* rTMS or ECT (any experiences? also hard to find)
* Meds I didn't try yet: Tranylcypromin (Parnate, irreversible MAOI, affects both enzymes in comp to Moclobemide), Clomipramine (but serotonergic drug and ssris/snris never worked so far), Lamotrigine (Mood Stabilizer, idk if this would be making sense?), Selegiline (MAO-B-I), Amisulpride (low dose should be effective for social anxiety and drive/energy/anhedonia), Tianeptine (Sulfat/Sodium, but should have a high addiction and withdrawal risks as I heard), Vortioxitine (Serotomodulator/stimulator), Buspirone, Hydroxzine, Risperidone (Mood Stabilizer), Abilify (Add-On, potent. AD one doc I found on youtube swears on being effective for depression for every of his patients he tried it on, maybe antipsychotic worth a try?), Rasagiline (MAO-B-I), Tofisopam, Trimipramine, Doxepine, Milnaneurax, Propranolol, Dopaminergic: Pramipexol, Ropinirol, Mianserine, Maprotiline, ADHD meds (i possibly suffer from ADD and just never got diagnosed it? reason why no meds or therapies worked so far for me as wrong diagnosis?: Atomoxetin, Modafinil, Ritalin, Dexamphetamin, Lisdexamfetamin), other Benzos (Clonazepam, Bromazepam, Alprazolam, Oxazepam)

Any idea what you'd do in my position? Rn I don't eat and just starve all the time, I don't drink, I don't sleep, this is very unhealthy so I have to do something PLUS my horrible depression and social anxiety not enabling me to go out, see friends, just canceling all appointments, dont visit university anymore and probably just have to quit my masters degree and never make real friends or romantic relationships, having no future in sight, while also being cognitively very retared and probably just turned dumb, no skills, no knowledge, just no future and no strengths or anything I could offer anyone - and the anxiety I could never catch up on all these things, skills, knowledge and experience other already have in my age (im 23 now).

I feel like I've missed out on a lot of experience and knowledge to survive in adulthood EVEN IF let's say survive depression and social anxiety itself. I don't know, I surely remember when I first noticed my mental health issues that my deep depression had big impacts on my cognition and joy or ability to learn things. The social anxiety contributed to this ""cogntive performance/ability"" in public of course. Now I don't know if it might have been all the many different meds I tried or the depression or a combination which made me so freaking dumb that kills my hope for being able to live a normal life even if I'd be able to finally ever feel not fucking hellishly depressed and freakingly socially anxious once. These are thoughts like I just dont have learned any skills, any knowledge about any topic or profession, might it just be football, basketball, following it on the TV and knowing about players, I don't know anything about cars or mechanics as some men my age do and makes them somehow ""manly"" for me, I can't play any instrument or don't play any sports in a team, I don't know anything about politics or any science topic. I'm just blank. Only positive I see is that I'm at least a good looking young man, a good looking loser. I feel so unmanly because of not knowing anything about this stuff and have no skills or knowledge I can offer. Makes me suicidal and reducing my self confidence and self worth a lot. I was really often thinking about having ADD (but started only very late or no one rarely urged to test me on this as I have social anxiety and by that surely am not the hyperactive ADHD type - i heard the missing H part is the reason why many ADHD patients get ignored even if the attention deficit disorder is still fully present).

I really have big hopes on meds even if 14 different ones didn't work yet but I don't know how my life could change other than a med, supplement or any substance being finally effective and supporting me cause I tried so much (therapies, diet, sports - they only help a little) and I really think it's just my brain chemistry and it can't get better without any substance helping me... even my new doc said this type of depression and anxiety I have can only be solved by pharmaceutical help or biochemical influence from the outside as so much didn't help me until now and I tried so much.

Sorry for the long text. This makes me see that Lyrica helped me to day with my issues as otherwise I would never have the energy to write so much and not feel bad and just crawl into my bed doing nothing than starving and staring on the wall or trying to sleep and just not feel my horrible feelings of depression, self hate and future anxiety. I really am living unhealthy now, so at this moment I really take even withdrawal of lyrica just to survive. But idk if this is a very bad idea. I try to not take it tomorrow, but maybe I feel so horrible again that I have to at least eat one meal, drink a bit of water, get out and get something done for university or other todos I just skipped for 2 weeks now...",1
"I’ve tried 3 times in the last few months to start taking the pills. 

Each time I get about 4 days in and turn into a zombie then panic I’m not going to be able to perform at work so talk myself out of needing them. I’m stuck in this cycle. 

I’ve been on them 3 times before but this time is not like the others, before I was anxiety overload, panic attacks and not leaving home and it was super obvious I needed them. 

This time it’s because of covid, Long story short I spend almost 2 years fully isolated (that’s a whole other story) now I’ve moved back to a city I noticed I don’t want and be around people, the total opposite of what I’m usually like, usually you can’t keep me in!

It could be possible I’m full on burnt out, these past 2 years have been the hardest of my life, end of a long relationship, isolation, family issues, serious back pain, new high pressure job and buying a house.

I can’t say I’m depressed but I recognised not wanting to be around people even after spending 2 years alone was not right. 
I’ve also totally come of social media and I don’t feel like even making a post about my new home or telling anyone about it. 

I need to be able to see friends and go on dates like I use to so after two years and about 4 full therapy courses which helped me though but didn’t fix me I’m back to getting on the meds so I can find myself again.

I think I’m burnt out from the last 2 years of high stress but no amount of sleep is making me want to be around people, going into the office once a week is no fun at all. I’ve also total lost all motivation for the passions I had before. I’m also still  not able to stop thinking about my ex even after two years which is not helping. 

Part of me thinks this is totally normal given what I’ve been through this last years and I just need to wait for things to get better, another part thinks if you’ve gone to the doctor 3 times asking for meds you’re not In a good place, if they gave them to me they agree and if I spend any more time feeling like I can’t be around people I’ll have some sort of breakdown which I could have stopped when I recognised something wasn’t right.

So I’m 4 days into my third attempt on Zoloft this year, it’s making me so sleepy which doesn’t work for me so I’m thinking of switching to Celexa as my doctor said it had easier side effects.

If anyone is interested I’ll keep you posted and if anyone has pushed through this wall whist working please let me know how you did it.

Thanks 🙏

I’m going to add a day diary here so people can see how it’s going in real time: 

I started on Zoloft 25mg taking in morning 

Day 1 -Didn’t feel much 

Day 2 - slept longer/really hard to get out of bed 

Day 3 - super hard to get our of bed and super fatigue all day without caffeine 

Felt like I was wading through Molasses most of the day.

Switched to citalopram at night and had terrible nights sleep. Woke up after few hours and had to take Valium to go back to sleep. 

Day 4 - Wiped out from bad nights sleep. Plan on taking next dose tmw after important meeting I have around 2pm. 

Drinking a lot of tea to try and wake up. 

Reason I switched meds so fast is I was given citalopram by doctor as she said it would be easier with side effects, also on Zoloft I didn’t really like the feeling so much last time, it make me super forgetful ie I could never remember if I locked my door and would have to go back and check like 4 times, which I never have usually. I was much happier though that’s for sure. 
So I’m giving Citalopram a bash to see if it’s any better than Zoloft this time around. If not I’ll go back to Zoloft and deal with the side effects.",1
"So I was on celexa for about 8 years and I felt like it wasn’t working anymore. I tapered off of it and my dr switched me to Effexor. 2 weeks on that and I was having palpitations and feeling short of breath so I called my doc. She called me in lexapro and I quit the Effexor and started lexapro the next day. Felt fine for 5 days and by day 9 I went into a state of panic that lasted well over 24 hours. I lost 12 lbs, couldn’t eat. I was having diarrhea nausea, shaking. My boyfriend said my pupils were dilated. I took Valium Benadryl and melatonin to try and sleep and they did nothing. My friend brought me a Xanax and it didn’t help either. So My friend told me I could possibly have serotonin syndrome. Quit taking the lexapro and slowly got better. Now I’m not in a constant panic, but I am struggling day to day with anxiety and depression. I have been taking propanolol and it helps some. 
I want to try lexapro again because in the beginning it really did make me feel better. I’m so scared I’ll get serotonin syndrome again. Idk where to go from here",1
"I suffered from anxiety all my life, a few bad patches which caused me to have to go on meds a few times. Zoloft. 

I came off them 5 years ago and had no intention of going back in them. 

I look after my mind and body now and always felt I wouldn’t need that crutch again. 

That was until now. 

I was in a good place till my 5 year relationship ended, it rocked my world much worse than I was expecting and I was the one who called it off but only as it was long distance and I didn’t want to live there, it truly broke me in half. I could not sleep without waking up in a panic for a year after this. 

Then having to move back into my parents during the pandemic, we’ll I didn’t have to but I decided I would so I could get a house deposit together so I could finally get myself sorted.

Thing is this lasted two years, my parents were on full lockdown as old and sick, so for about two years I hardly left he house, I did zero socialising. I just worked really hard at a new online job I have and pretty much nothing else.

The problem is I had bad social anxiety all my life so this 2 years extreme isolation along with the breakup and my parents having a very unhealthy relationship just burnt me out mentally.

I stopped sleeping right for about a year and I just felt exhausted all the time. I’d also been super fit but I started getting out if shape. Mainly as I just couldn’t get a proper nights sleep.

I tried all sorts of meds for sleep, I’ve had more Psychotherapy that anybody needs in a lifetime, like I’ve probably seen 20 plus people about my anxiety in my life and nothing helps me. It’s good to talk about it of course but my brain just always goes back where it was.

Anyway I finally saved up enough to buy a house and I got my own place. 
Which should be absolutely amazing right? Apart from the fact that I’m so anxious now I don’t feel like I can be around people, even friends. I literally spent two years in solitary confinement more or less and now I’m finding it extremely hard to socialise again, When I have to go into the office one day a week I’m literally having a panic attacks or crawling out of my skin when I have to talk to the boss. 

So I decided to that even though I’m not depressed I need medical help to break this cycle. It’s like I’ve lost myself somehow these last few years and not feeling able to hang around friends or manage a day in the office is not a healthy sigh. 

So I’m back on the Zoloft, for how long I don’t know. I’m thinking that i need to be on it for life given how hard it is for me to manage anxiety over the years. In almost all social situations I have to have a Valium or beta blocker in my bag just incase I have a panic attack. I’m sick of feeling like I could have one at any time. It makes by me feel like I’m living my life in a box and my anxiety is holding me back from reaching my full potential.

I do worry the Initial side-effects are gonna be pretty horrible to manage at work but I really need this holiday from anxiety so I can find myself again and get back to living.

It’s weird because amongst my friends I’m considered one of the most mentally strong, I run ultramarathons and have numerous achievements yet I have this daily battle with my nerves and every 4/5 years I just can’t take it anymore and have to get back on meds, This makes me think that I should just stay on them now for life rather that this rollercoaster ride I’m on. 

I always came off after a year or so when I feel better but I’m thinking this time I might just stay on because I just can’t be dealing with the chronic social anxiety that follows.

I’ll be interested to hear about anybody that’s been on an off antidepressants multiple times or has decided to stay on them for a very long time like 10 20 30 years and how it’s been. Can You still function well at work In a professional environment? 

I’ll be amazed if anybody’s made it to the end of that, it was a proper waffle! If you did thanks for taking the time 🙏",1
"Hey all, I’m on Zoloft 100mg and Trazadone (100-125mg for sleep) and have lately been having bad low blood sugar symptoms like shaking, dizziness, vertigo and loss of appetite. Has anyone else experienced this while on an antidepressant?",1
"Antidepressants are nice when they work, but eventually for me they stop working after a few months, 

Alsp there's a million different antidepressants and combinations, it's so annoying to figure out


Not to mention it takes 2 weeks, possibly months!!

I don't want to waste the next 5 years of my life trying to give every antidepressant a try 

I will say tho Wellbutrin & effexor helped but the dosages were to hard to balance


Drugs give me a sense of control weirdly enough


Cuz the effects r less complicated and well known

 - u feel lethargic? Pop a addy or Ritalin or coke
- u feel anxious? Take a Valium or a shot of vodka
- u in pain? Pop an opiod
 


Even those drugs can impact everyone differently tho, I don't get high off of amphetamines no matter what dose, but Ritalin makes me so damn calm, yet focalin makes me so damn euphoric


For my friend amphetamines make him so high, Ritalin doesn't do anything for him, etc.


Yada-yada-yada u get the point



I just want to be stable 



One things for sure, exercise! 


Diet is too complex to figure out aswell.





Just wish there was a magic pill or a cure, instead of this endless swimming in Circles",1
"Long story short, I'm down to 37.5mg of effexor from 225mg a few months ago. Been having anxiety over the last taper from 75 to 37.5mg, and getting a bit better each day that goes by. I'm not out of the woods yet, so I emailed my dr to ask about a potential benzo to help aid the last stretches/panic attacks that might occur, and how I've used valium before with no issues(as in, according to the script), and got replied to by a dr I've never seen since mine is out if fucking town AGAIN, essentially was just accused of going to get addicted to it  and to go back to a higher dose of effexor.
Fuck that bullshit.
No acknowledging that antidepressants are just as bad as benzos in withdrawal or dependence.  Sure i get the paranoia about benzos but this particular office always clutches their pearls the moment they hear ""benzo""

I'm really thinking I need a new dr",1
"Started valdoxan august 2019. Mid 2020 it stopped working as well. 

I think it puts me to sleep, but if my sleep gets interrupted in anyway (noise,  bladder problem, back pain) its very hard to get back to sleep, and then i feel very groggy the next day. Where as before valdoxan, I had insomnia, not falling asleep for over 4 hours, but once I was asleep I would sleep solidly. 

I went off valdoxan  mid 2020 because I felt like it was making my quality of sleep worse. But my sleep became how it was pre valdoxan, would take hours to fall asleep, AND I would be woken up by my back pain and bladder throughout the night. After 3 hours sleep I start waking up every 15 min/half hour, for a breif moment of ""oh God my back/bladder"" wriggle about, fall asleep then rinse and repeat.  

Weirdly enough, two nights this week I had some ectasy, and hours later when I had a valdoxan and valium I had the BEST sleep of my life. Maybe because the ectasy took away my back pain. Maybe because I danced that night and it tired me out. 

Has anyone here had trouble with valdoxan? Did it stop working after a while? What's your story",1
I have Valium on me but ran out of my script for tomorrow so I was wondering what will happen if I miss one dose? I’m on 75mg for a few months,1
"Like the only thing that really helped me be in a positive headspace for months on end was Risperidone with Zoloft. However Zoloft as a standalone was not good enough. 

&#x200B;

Got prescribed Valium before i get put back on Risperidone, i took 10mg of Valium a few hours ago and i don't get the obsession with it, i still felt myself ruminating and dissociating and feeling out of touch with my self, but there was this urge to take more and more, i wanted to take about 5 of them to see what happens, almost something drawing me in to take it but there is no high just more so a sleep inducing calming like effect and reduced nervousness. Codeine is honestly the best thing that helps me recreationally and gets me high. Maybe the Valium is not working because i don't have Pure O, individuals with OCD tend to be very very panicky, i on the other hand don't so it seems pointless to use Valium",1
"I have experienced withdrawal from multiple street drugs and psychiatric meds including but not limited to alcohol, cocaine, heroin, Suboxone, Klonopin, Valium, these being the worst offenders. With Suboxone stealing the #1 spot as the worst, simply because the process is so drawn out. I hear all these horror stories about antidepressants and the brain zaps and vertigo. Say you can't fill a prescription for Effexor, a notoriously difficult SNRI to quit. Are you totally screwed? Will you be sent to the ER? Many have said they tapered painstakingly bead by bead month by month and still went through hell. Not to brag but I stopped 5mg Klonopin/day habit cold turkey with a few 300mg gabapentin advised to take in case of seizures. I found the process not nearly as horrific aside for a few  strange days and restless nights. It surprised my psychiatrist. Also for small measure, I quit amitriptiline cold turkey after two weeks. There was a strange feeling of vertigo but disappeared within hours and I didn't miss a night of sleep. Granted I only took it for two weeks. My question is this. How would you rate your AD withdrawal to other meds. Is it even comparable? I ask because really want to go on Effexor long term",1
"I’ve been taking Effexor-XR (venlafaxine) 225mg/1x day for years now, and I’ve noticed that it significantly increases my tolerance to benzodiazepines. While some can take one Xanax and be content, I have to take at least more than double that to even feel any effect. Has anyone else noticed this?? It is this way with all the benzos I’ve had (Xanax, Ativan, Valium, Lexotan, Klonopin...). I’m a small person (50kg, 160cm). Please note that I do not abuse these drugs but have used them only for certain occasions, like long flights, insomnia, panic attacks, just short term use, so I haven’t really built up any habit-forming tolerance.

Sounds stupid,1
"Valium tollerance develops really fast, before you know it you’ll be eating way too many or doing something stronger like xanax or mixing it with alcohol. Plus withdrawal from benzos is literally so bad i was having blackouts and problems talking clearly for about 6months",1
I used to take Xanax every day (because my doctor told me to) and it caused a whole bunch of problems for me. The combo of venlafaxine and gabapentin has completely warded off panic attacks for me,1
"Hey no Valium is not good it’s just a drug it’s just as bad as being addicted to any other downer :( I deal with the same thing as you . I have ptsd and it’s really bad , your nervous system is dysregulated and you need to slowly get it back to normal . Through first taking care of your body , change your gut micro biome . Tell yourself your safe , the mind can do wonders , rewire your brain and you need to calm yourself down so it can get out of that fight or flight response and not be triggered so easily all the time . Breathe work helps a lot , cold showers . Excercise and learning your triggers and being aware of your body . There’s lots too it but if you put in the work it can get better , I know how tireing it is feeling like that but your only going to stay in that spot if you don’t heal , if you want to talk more you can message me . Also your nervous system is your brain so by being hypervigilent your also going to have anxious thoughts because we think how we feel . Your brain is connected to your spinal cord and your body so by taking care of yourself and re regulating the nervous system that should help you calm yourself and your body . Hope that helps , also long term affects of ptsd can wreak havoc on the body . I am just dealing with this now but for me over the years I have developed more mental illnesses , bad psychological issues , a thyroid disorder and now everything is affecting my entire body and life . So don’t just bandaid a issue that needs true inner work/healing because it will only mask serious symptoms that need proper treatment so you can heal and be the best version of yourself again. Take care",1
"Valium and other Benzos are really something your only supposed to use when you have to they don’t treat anxiety rather they just numb the feeling for a time if your doctors telling you something else chances are, he’s probably trying to kill you , I’ve never developed tolerance or dependence to any benzos but I’ve heard it loses its magic and trying to get off is hell to and there are long term health effects so please just try to use it as a tool rather then a cure to your problems",1
"Long term it will cause more problems than it helps.  If you try to go off the valium make sure you taper off very slowly.  I recommend you check out the site Benzo Buddies.  You want to try to find something safer to take for anxiety.  I don't know if you tried nefazodone as that can be really helpful for anxiety.  r/Nefazodone  You could also try any of these meds for anxiety gabapentin/pregabalin, hydroxyzine, buspirone, or propranolol.",1
"Absolutely not. Regardless of all other problems daily benzodiazepines cause, it will stop working after a couple days/weeks",1
"Yes - I've tried all antidepressants and they all gave me unbearable side effects, namely severe insomnia",1
"gapapentim (and pregabalin) also cause  tolerance, just like benzodiazepines",1
Thank you so very much for providing me with this detailed information - it is most appreciated 😊 I might see a GP to enquire about taking Seroquel as a long-term solution,1

"I do .. I’m weaning off Prozac and going on effexor, I take buspar 2x daily and Clonidine 3x a day and now she just prescribed me Valium instead of Xanax now but I’m afraid to take it bc idk how it’s gonna make me feel",1
"Ugh jm sorry .. they have me hydroxozine too and in fact I feel like it makes it worse. Ithey give it to people in the hospital sometimes right  before surgery. All it does is make you somewhat tired, doesn’t help calm anxiety, doesn’t stop the worrying thoughts. Now you’re just exhausted and can’t sleep bc of the anxiety but I heard klonopin was good too .. Ativan and klonopin are benzos too",1
Your analogy doesn’t stand. DMT and LSD are extremely different drugs. Here we’re talking about two benzos that have a massively bigger overlap in their metabolic pathways and action,1
"Valium is good cause it lasts a really long time, much longer than Xanax",1
"Okay, I’ll try to just not overthink it and just take it.. my doctor did tell me that Valium lasts
Longer so that makes me feel a little better too",1
"I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/s/sN64Qx9o3x) a couple of days about about having a positive pregnancy test even though I am a lesbian and haven’t had sex with a male in 6 years. I got a lot of good advice and kind words, thank you all so much. I’m going to try to explain what is happening now but between stress and medicine I’m not sure I’m able to make a lot of sense and I’m not sure if I understand it.

I went to my parents house last night and told them what was happening and my this morning my dad found an urgent care about two hours from their house that had an ultrasound machine and they were willing to see me and my mom took me. They did another pregnancy test and it was also positive and then did a regular ultrasound and did not find a pregnancy, so they had me go to the emergency room because they said a positive pregnancy test with an empty uterus is an emergency because it could mean there is a fetus growing outside of the uterus which is very dangerous.

The ER did a transvaginal ultrasound and couldn’t find a pregnancy and they did blood work and said my pregnancy hormone levels are very high and my potassium and iron are a little low, and they thought they could see something on my right ovary so they did laprascopic surgery. They ended up removing my entire ovary because they found a kind of tumor on it called an immature teratoma.

I don’t remember going in for surgery or waking up but I was freaking out and hysterical when I woke up and they had to give me Valium in an IV. Mom and the nurses told me about the tumor later. 

The nurse said that they are talking to some specialists and doing pathology to find out if it’s malignant or not because they said a teratoma could be either malignant or not, and I have tried looking up information online but I don’t know if I understand it. 

I know I owe apologies to my friend who I thought might have raped me, please no one make me feel worse about that than I already do. 

I think I am staying at the hospital over night.

My questions now are how long does pathology take? Is pathology the same thing as a biopsy? Would the tumor explain why I have been throwing up or is that something else? Will they be able to tell me if I have cancer before I leave the hospital? If it is cancer, am I going to die?",1

"26, Female, 164cm/52kg.

A few years ago I would take a valium 5mg maybe once every few months just to help with my anxiety.

Lately (since February) I've been taking it once every three weeks or so, and then in the past two months, maybe twice a week, and in the past 5 weeks maybe 3-4 times a week increasingly.

I started out with half a tablet, but then that started not doing anything for me, so I started taking a whole tablet. And now when I take a whole tablet, it feels like it's not doing anything anymore again.

I'm aware that you very realistically can get addicted to this stuff and I have a mind to go and see a psych about my anxiety and to get something more permanent and better, but with everything going on it's hard right now.

I also just love the way it makes me feel, and I'm worried I might be getting addicted to the feeling more than anything. Now if I go a few days without it I start to get antsy and annoyed and I think about it a lot.

What should I do?",1
"M, 29, 180, 6ft, White.

I took roughly 900mg of diazepam over the course of a year after suffering multiple panic attacks and crippling anxiety due to multiple deaths in my immediate family (and the resulting nightmare of people losing their homes/financial security, nightmares I often took upon myself to remediate).

I've been off it for about a month now, but am still feeling dull, a bit absent minded, and generally antsy.   I'm a writer by trade, so my livelihood relies on creativity, verbal memory, and critical thinking, but I've found myself having difficulty with visualization and frequently suffer tip of the tongue memory problems with words that have no business being lost to me.

Other information: I occasionally drank while taking the medication, thought not concurrently, and consume considerable amounts of coffee.  I drank 3-4 beers a week ago and suffered one of the worst hangovers of my life, so became concerned about excitotoxicity.

Should I be concerned that I've damaged myself, or is this normal/the result of anxiety itself?  I read about problems associated with long term use, but have no idea what the definition of long term is.",1

"5’6 110lbs 28F

Dx: SUD

I take 140mg of Vyvanse. My medications are all over the place. I describe them below. 

I got a ton of Gabapentin from an addictions clinic. And then Lyrica. And cyclobenzaprine. 

I was abusing the Gabapentin for a month but the tolerance built so fast it did nothing basically. But I was taking up to 1800mg at once every few hours. 

I was also taking 10-40mg of the cyclobenzaprine. 

Two weeks ago, I then combed this with Lyrica 300mg every other day for three days in total. 

I stopped the Gabapentin a nine days ago. I had panic attacks the day after stopping. I ended up taking eighth Tylenol threes. I then could not sleep and took 30mg of cyclobenzaprine over the course of two hours, and Benadryl. I thought I was going to die the next day. 

That week, I began to just abuse the Lyrica. I took 300ng one day, 600mg the next, and 900mh the next again. 

I also got a Valium script filled, like seven days ago. I went through 30 5mg pills in those seven days. 

Two days ago, I took the Gabapentin again. 900mg, and then two hours later 600mg. I blacked out cold. I took Valium during the day but not much. 

Last night, I took 1800mg Gabapentin with 20mg of Valium. I was not falling asleep and felt emotional for some reason. 

Today, at around 1PM, I took two and a half Tylenol threes. I immediately developed a bad headache. I became nearly immobile and was hardly conscious. I began to regain consciousness a bit and was hit with terrible nausea, and headache still. 

Trying to stand made me almost puke. 

I felt better at around 8PM and tried to drive. I became violently ill. I made it home and began to puke on the pavement. I puked again. And I think I’m going to puke after posting this. And I still have a horrible headache. 


Am I in danger? why would two Tylenol three do this? Is it just interacting with the Valium from last night?",1
"I am writing this on behalf of my husband. He is 57M, 5'6"", 145 lbs. For about 2.5 years he has had a really odd mix of autoimmune and neurological symptoms. It all started at once but has moved around. He has a combo of fibromyalgia and muscle weakness/fasciculations. Sometimes his hands randomly cramp up or shake. Sometimes it's hard for him to lift a fork to his mouth. Sometimes on one hand, sometimes on the other, but mostly left.  But he can run and climb. He also has great balance (better than most) and has had zero issues with speech or swallowing. He has been working out and is still growing muscle. Light weights, but he's a skinny ultra runner who hadn't focused on strength for years.

For about 2.5 years he has had a really odd mix of autoimmune and neurological symptoms. It all started suddenly and now the neurological symptoms... move all over his body. He has a combo of fibromyalgia and muscle weakness/fasciculations. Sometimes his hands randomly cramp up or they shake (this scares him because of Parkinson's). Sometimes it's hard for him to lift a fork to his mouth. Symptoms move around, sometimes on one hand, sometimes on the other, but mostly left.  But he can run and climb. He also has great balance (better than most) and has had zero issues with speech or swallowing. He has been working out and is still growing muscle. Light weights, but he's a skinny ultra runner who hadn't focused on strength for years.

Now here is the history and some more detail.

About 2.5 years ago he had an episode where his entire body cramped up, he had visible spasms all over his body and he could hardly walk for over a month. He had multiple tests. I don't remember what they all were, but I know they did some that tested for protein in the blood (muscle loss). I remember that one because he got really nervous about diseases with muscle wasting when all of this happened and the doctors threw out a bunch of ""could be"" that terrified him. He has had testing for vitamin deficiencies. B vitamins, D vitamins, I think even iron. He was tested for Lyme Disease. He had it back in 2007 and there were no antibodies. Up until that day he had had no issues, though his body was starting to feel off that morning. Some extra tightness.

Since then, he has had a weird mix of what his neurologist thought were autoimmune and neurological symptoms. He has constant fasciculations everywhere, though mostly in his arms. They used to be more in his legs. He is always in pain and sometimes he gets bad fibromyalgia episodes where he just feels awful. Really tired, in pain more than usual, and just doesn't feel well. I already mentioned that he has no issues with balance and he's back to running, though MANY miles less than he used to run. Everything is worse when he's stressed. The neurological symptoms are mostly in his hands and arms. He is also a musician and it's gotten harder for him to play. He says it feels like just can't get his fingers to do what he wants them to do sometimes. He will have hand cramps and his fingers get rigid on both sides, but fine motor issues are mostly on the left. When his legs weren't cooperating, it was mostly on the right side.

He has had some additional tests since then. I can't remember the name of the test, but he's had an MRI that looked at lesions to rule out MS. There was nothing of note there - just age-related changes. He had an ANA test that was negative. So, MS, Lupus and Huntington's have all been ruled out. He did have an EMG that showed axonal loss in his left arm. That's the only thing he's had that's been abnormal.

For medications:

He is Cymbalta for his fibromyalgia and when he's run out, he had really bad episodes.  The pain got to where it was before he ever started taking it. He takes methocarbamol or Valium as needed when things get really bad for him. They help. Sometimes he takes ibuprofen.

He also takes turmeric, Vitamin B complex, magnesium, zinc, calcium, skull cap, valerian, mushroom blend regularly. He has for a long time.

He is (otherwise) healthy, no issues with heart or weight or choleserol or other chronic issues. He eats a very healthy, mostly plant-based diet and he always has. He is seeing a neurologist and hasn't been able to get into a rheumatologist. Well, one rheumatologist, but he completely dismissed my husband and didn't even believe him when he said he had Reynaud's (other doctors said he did). Hasn't been able to get another one since. Nobody can really figure out what is going on. Any insight from personal or professional experience would be great.

Please let me know if you need anything else!

"Hi, I'm male, 55 and my doctor has been prescribing Valium for anxiety and insomnia for 10+ years. Due to new regulations I was asked to submit a urine sample which came back positive for a controlled substance (it was not opiods or painkillers).
My doctor has informed me he can no longer prescribe me any controlled substance including benzodiazepines.
My question is what do I do now? He has literally prescribed every anti-anxiety and sleep aid there is in the past and Valium is what has worked for me. It seems my only recourse is to find another doctor but my record will follow me, no? ",1
"30F, 114lbs 

Diagnosis: Delusional disorder (possibly unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder), persistent depression with episodes, SUD. 

Medication: Lurasidone - 60mg, Dexedrine - erratic dose. I was on 55-75mg+ of Dexedrine for some months - prior to that 40mg for several months- and was very unwell, then I went off it cold turkey for two weeks ago, then relapsed last Wednesday where I began taking around 40-70mg erratically. 
 
The issue: Apparent depressive episode (?) began at some point last week and it was unlike any depression I’ve experienced before in terms of it impacting my behaviour - impulsive and erratic. Possibly that’s related to reintroduction of Dexedrine as described above, but I don’t know why. 

I have been in an erratic and bizarre crisis since Saturday morning. I was detained later that Saturday, as I went to ER for SI and fairly severe prolonged stimulant abuse as a form of passive SI. Didn’t know why I went to the ER or what I was wanting exactly. Had voice pretending to be my own tell me it was all for attention, which made me feel bad, and it made me confused about my intentions. I’ve been really self-perplexed in escalation these past two months, and it’s getting bad. Been waking up at the crack of dawn for some months now too without feeling tired, so I was worried about an impending psychotic episode but I don’t feel psychotic. I’m definitely not manic. 

Anyway, on Saturday I went ahead and took 95mg of Adderall, albeit expired, whilst in the hospital hooked up to machines and on top of the 50mg of Dexedrine I had already taken. I have no fucking clue why I did that. Been acting real erratic lately also in escalation. I also am convinced there’s a conspiracy amongst healthcare professional to think I’m making it up for attention, so I can start to act real weird because of that cause I think their beliefs about me control me (I.e., I act it out like it’s true) and their thoughts mess up my own ability to know what’s the issue. 

But yeah I was so depressed while in the ER that my heart rate didn’t budge from the stimulants and I hardly felt it. But I got mad sick in the end for many hours. I also was able to quit vaping a massive amount of nicotine prolonged use that day (and beyond) with absolutely zero withdrawals, which was very bizarre and never in my life has happened before. My head felt strange for the past few days, prior Saturday, like I was high or something, but it wasn’t the stimulants. 

Was detained as a patient for the night due to Adderall consumption. Left in the morning assuming I was fine and it was all for attention, as I couldn’t shake off the thought even though it didn’t feel like mine at all. 

Came back to hospital as I was going to OD on Tylenol 3 and again kept having a voice pretending to me be telling me how I’m faking it and to just do it to prove I’m not. I kept thinking it was my thoughts so I felt bad and began to take the pills. I panicked and went to the ER. 

I saw psychiatry after nine hours and began to, after talking with the doctor, act erratic and get a bit angry and weirdly emotional. I was convinced the doctor didn’t understand what was happening, I think. Maybe? I honestly don’t know why I got angry. I felt like he didn’t understands the veracity of the situation - that a SI with a plan was just a small piece of it - but I also don’t nor did I understand what I meant by that and assumed it was the ring inside me trying to make me fake it, which caused me to despair and act more erratic. I had enough of it as I panicked and was upset and thus said I was leaving. 

I then left the ER and went home after tearfully announcing I was going to go home to OD. I again don’t know why I did that or if it was true. They tried to have me stay but they brought the same psychiatrist back to see me to ask if I changed my mind, so I got angry and told him to go fuck himself for no reason, which I also have no idea why and feel bad about myself for it and very embarrassed. I became convinced something was taking me over to make me look bad and act crazy. 

I left and began to start to OD on Valium mixed with Codeine. Downed a bunch of Valium to make the nerves go away. But then another part of me didn’t want me to die so it called the crisis hotline and the hotline person ended up calling emergency services, after I had taken a copious amount of Codeine. Was forced to go back to the hospital with them at 4AM, or else I’d be detained involuntarily. So I went voluntarily, sat down, informed the nurse I was leaving because I was there voluntarily, and then I left without quarrel. I was obviously blitz out of my mind and the gravity of the situation was entirely lost on me. I just wanted to go sleep. 

Woke up today. Got 3 hours of sleep but feel not tired at all. Thought the crisis and depression was wholly over upon waking as in my mind I felt great. It’s now the end of the day and I realize I don’t remember what I did all day or how it’s already 8PM, my sense of time is totally gone, I’m thinking last night didn’t actually happen, and I feel paranoid of people, agitated, and vaguely afraid. It’s like my life lost cohesion and continuity for seemingly no reason and I no longer know what’s going on. 

I don’t think I’m suicidal anymore, but I still feel really unstable and confused. Do I just ride it out? They’re not going to take me seriously if I go back a third time, and I’m sure they diagnosed me with things that will make them want me to leave. But the reality of the fact that I just left after trying to OD within the context of escalating erratic and perplexing behaviour is concerning the last of my brain cells. ",1
"Female, 31yr. Not sure if this is an appropriate subreddit but I’ve been having problems with my eyes/vision for the past couple of days. I had an outpatient procedure for something unrelated and was prescribed Valium and Tylenol 3 for pain for the procedure. I’ve never taken Valium/Diazepam before but I’ve been having double vision and problems just focusing my eyes. I even made an appointment with an eye doctor and they said because it’s a muscle relaxer it also seemed to have affected the muscles in my eyes and as the medication leaves my system it should go back to normal and if not to follow up. While it is a little better it’s still concerning to me and uncomfortable. I took 1 10mg tablet on Wednesday. Is it normal to still have side effects 3 days later? Would that even be a cause? When I called the pharmacy they said it should be out of my system by now. ",1
"
F21 / 210 pounds / 5’8 
no medical conditions (besides this) and no daily medicines 

about 3 year ago ( i was 17) i got into a golf cart accident. i was passenger and we flipped. i landed on my left outer thighs and had ripped the muscle off the fascia. within 5 mins i had a fluid collection and huge bruise and obviously immense pain. i went to trauma hospital and was discharged with it being called a contusion. 

it was constant pain so i went to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon. 
he diagnosed me with a MLL. 
all x-rays were clear of fractures and any other issue. 

we waited 6 months for it to go away on its own, it obviously didn’t so 8 months post injury 
we got a ultrasound and a mri. 
these are the ultrasound results 


- There appears to be indistinctness between the subcutaneous tissue and muscle fascia with fluid appearing changes noted tracking in part through the subcutaneous tissues superficially. The
superficial soft tissues may be slightly echogenic. A small area of fluid appearing abnormality spans for instance 3.4 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm. A palpable area of abnormality which appears to have fluid and soft tissue changes spans about 5.6 x 2.3 cm. - 

we also got a mri but i do not have results. 
i went into IR and got a biopsy / aspiration. took about 30 mins. by the time i got back to the recovery room all the fluid was back and basically nothing changed. 


so then we planned for a incision and drainage in the real OR 

it was supposed to be a 1 hour surgery but turned into a 6 hour surgery. here is the post op notes from the surgeon. 

A skin marker was used to draw out our planned incision. A 15-blade scalpel was used to create a 10 cm incision on the lateral aspect of the proximal thigh, centered over the fluctuance. Bovie electrocautery was used for adequate hemostasis, as we dissected through subcutaneous tissue onto the collection.
Distally, there was a tract extending almost to subcutaneous tissue and once penetrated, 20cc synovial appearing fluid was released. A swab was sent for cultures but did not appear infected. This tract was followed to the iliotibial band, where it was found to be scarred and adherent, passing more proximally and anteriorly. The cavity was vast, measuring
approximately 10x16cm and was found to be lobulated, as well as epithelialized circumferentially with formation of a bursal sack. A cobb elevator was used to separate the cystic layer from the IT band. No disruption of the IT band was noted. A curved mayo scissor was used for sharp excisional debridement of the entire outer cyst layer. The cobb was used to roughly debride the underlying fascial and subcutaneous fat layers to stimulate scarring. The wound was copiously irrigated with sterile saline. A 15-french JP drain was applied adjacent to the IT band. The wound was closed in layered fashion meticulously, using O-vicryl sutures to systematically tack the deep subcutaneous layers to the IT band from the margins of the wound to the center. The remaining dead-space was then closed using the O-vicryl sutures for layered fat closure. 2-0 vicryl and 4-0 monocryl were used to close the subcutaneous tissue and subcuticular layer of skin, respectively. The incision was cleaned and dried and covered with steri-strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4 gauze, and an acewrap for compression after injection of local anesthetic peri-incisionally. The patient was extubated, awoken from anesthesia without complication and transported to PACU for recovery in stable condition.
Of note, the procedure was much more difficult due to the irregular shape of the lesion, including multiple loculations and tracts, which made debridement more tedious, time-consuming and technically difficult. The fact that the collection had formed a pseudocyst with epithelialized layer adherent to the underlying fascia also complicated the procedure. Her morbid obesity also added significantly to the difficulty of the procedure in completing our dissection and visualization of the layers for complex closure, as we attempted to minimize the size of the surgical scar for cosmesis.
- 

after that i had a drain and stayed in hospital for about 3 days until i got it pulled. 
i had about 30cc coming out per day 

after that i had a follow up and it mostly returned to normal. i had numbness on the actual skin and still do to this day. 

now where the issue comes in, about 3 days ago i walked off a curb without knowing it dropped down and the second my leg hit the floor it’s like my whole thigh exploded, right where thr old injury was. 

i tried to go home but couldn’t even get out of the car, i was in immediate 10/10 pain. 
we went to the er; they did x ray, ultrasound to check for blood clots and a ct with contrast. 
there was nothing. 
they gave me
morphine , valium , roboxin and nothing would touch the pain
it also stated to spasm 

they discharged me and sent me to ortho the next day 
i was prescribed percocet 5MG, a lidocaine patch and a muscle relaxer. all were denied by insurance and Percocet was on back order on all my approved pharmacy’s. so i had no medicine at all (granted i’ve never taken pain meds before this besides my surgery )

between ortho and the er 
i could barely ambulate, not life my leg at all without bending my knee and was constantly taking IB and tylenol every 4 hours. 
went to ortho and they said they think muscle ripped of the bone and sent me home. 
they weren’t able to perscribe me anything else and i wasn’t able to make it till the mri (next day) because i was in so much pain. 

so i went to the er (the hospital i work at) to see if they could help me. 
i was admitted for intractable pain and they did a mri and it was also clear. 

i’ve been here since friday morning. 
ortho came today and said 
well these injuries don’t really heal well, so we’ll get ur situated with the pain and send you out

its now sunday 
and the pain is still 8/10 consistently
i’ve been on percocet 5mg and 10mg and nothing is touching the pain i also have lidocaine patch on and getting muscle relaxers (don’t know the name)

it spasms when i dont walk so i have to walk around but obviously that causes extreme pain. i basically shuffle around not using my knee joint 
just kind of sliding my left foot while pushing with my right. 

i feel like i did exactly after my accident. 
when my surgeron opened me up he found multiple tracks filled with fluid all around my leg  hence why it took much longer because those tracks weren’t seen on mri. he stiched all my layers back up and closed all the tracks. 

what i’m feeling like is one of those tracks opened up when i stepped down and they’re not able to see it on mri because they never have before until i was open. 

basically my question is
is anyone familiar with a MLL? 

what this could possibly be? 

and what can i recommend the orthopedic surgeon to do? 

thank you so much in advance 


i have a few images from my MRI i will link in comments if needed

"a person i know 18M 5'9 137lbs,he has been smoking since he was 14 both weed and cigarettes, he has done alot more drugs aswell. He used to be dependant on valium and he was on them for about a month last summer. He started doing them again on saturday but he does not have access to them anymore. He started asking what would happen if he took methadone and i said i dont know. i tried to search it up and he asked his friend, who said he will overdose on a tiny drop which i trust his friend in this situation more than him and told him if theres no answers on anything and other people are saying its a bad idea he should not try to get any or do it. i dont know how he would get access to it but if he did what would happen?

"24f, kidney infection. For simplicity sake i’ll start from the beginning. Today is Saturday, but on Monday I left work early because something really just didn’t feel right. My back and side were in a lot of pain and because I already have chronic back pain, I knew it wasn’t that. Just generally felt unwell and that was happening since Sunday so I went to the ER. Thankfully I did because after somewhat chilling for a bit, the pain became excruciating like no pain I’ve ever experienced. There ran their tests and prescribed me oxy/ acetaminophen, valium, and my antibiotic Cefpodoxime. 

Well, the next day (Tuesday) is when the fever started and I couldn’t get a handle of my antibiotic quickly because my normal pharmacy was out. The oxy wasn’t working for pain nor was it bringing my fever down which got as high as 101.5, we didn’t want to just start mixing stuff (over the counter) so my boyfriend decided that we should go back. They ran all the same tests, things didn’t look any worse, but this time they gave me Toradol (Ketorolac) and Ibuprofen 800mg. These seemed to do very well with managing the pain, but the fever was generally consistent Wednesday-Thursday (ranged from maybe 99.7-101) depending on when I took the meds. We are following the amount of time recommended between doses, but it seems like any time I fell asleep regardless of when I took them, my fever would spike and I’d either wake up sweating or shivering uncontrollably. At one point, the only way we could bring my fever down was to put ice packs on me and sleeping with no blankets. 

Friday, my fever broke for the first time which was nice but that only lasted for a few hours and now today, Saturday, I woke up generally feeling the best I have all week. Still exhausted, temperature ranging from 98.4-99 (my normal temp is usually 97.9) but managed to take a real shower instead of a half assed one and pick up a little bit. Well that just took it all out of me so I took a nap and here I am with 100.4 and I feel terrible again.

Now for my question: Is this normal with an infection like this? Is it concerning that I’ve had a consistent fever for 5 days? And when should I consult with a doctor about this fever? If it’s normal with something like a kidney infection then by all means, but I would just like to know when I should be concerned.

I appreciate any advice or help in advance!

"26F 115lbs 5'6

I went cold turkey off of 65-80mg of dexedrine (daily use for a few months - though started the drug in September and was daily user). Only ever taken prescribed pills, never from the streets. Spent $4500 USD for three nights at a detox last week out of desperation to get off the pills, because I was getting really scary side effects from the high dose and was so jacked up all the time I could do basically nothing.

I was put on wellbutrin and that seemed to do the trick. I felt awful in terms of anxiety but I was by no means bedridden (aside from day 1 where I was so anxious I couldn't walk or talk properly) and surprisingly had only very little fatigue. Physically I felt and looked 100x better, immediately. My hands and feet lost their disconcerting red-purple deadened colour, and my face looked healthy - starting on the very first day I didn't take any dexedrine.

By day three off them the intense hunger came, but it wasn't too bad compared to what I've experienced before. I ate until I felt really sick at most meals, but I'm underweight so it was fine. By day four it seemed like the intense hunger was letting up.

But then it all came crashing down on me. On day four I noticed I felt quite sick after drinking any caffeine or vaping nicotine. Like burnt-out stressed, super hungover sick. Trying to drink tea or coffee made me so lethargic I'd be non-functional.

By day five I would be bedridden after taking even one puff of my vape. I'm highly addicted to nicotine so I vaped a ton anyway and obviously felt maximally horrible. The burnt-out feeling started to jack up my appetite to the utter max. I'd eat a huge breakfast, try to drink coffee in hopes of feeling some sort of stimulation, and then end up so lethargic-hungry from that I'd eat another huge breakfast and be in agony, and then thirty minutes later I'd overeat again (think like eating a six huge slabs of french toast in one sitting then doing that again and again). It was the kind of stressed-out feeling where your body reacts with hunger, but it never let up.

By day six this was even worse. I no longer looked healthier - I looked massively hungover from the stress, as if I had been out all night and downed a litre of vodka. I couldn't even walk for five minutes without needing to eat a massive amount of something. I was so lethargic I ended up taking a large dose of valium just to try to make existing slightly more bearable, but it didn't even help. I should have stopped vaping nicotine and stopped drinking caffeine, but I couldn't as I was so anxious, stressed out and wasn't thinking clearly at all.

I couldn't handle it anymore so on day seven, and whilst feeling like utter crap still, I cracked open my last bottle of dexedrine. I thought I'd just take 10mg to make the feeling go away, but those were famous last words and I've been taking 20-40mg for the past three days and feeling like I'm on crack basically. But the lethargic hung-over feeling is 10000% gone, and I can drink caffeine and vape again just fine and feel good. It was like all the stress immediately melted away and I felt fantastic all day long for the first time in several months.

So yeah, what do I do? Should I try to taper down instead (likely impossible), or try to stay on them but at a low dose? Does anyone know why that happened to me? I was thinking of quitting vaping whilst on the dex (haven't vaped today) in hopes of helping me be able to go off the drugs eventually (might not even be able to get a refill since it's now written in bold on my records that I have a stim SUD). But I can't live in a state where I have zero stress regulation and eat to the point I'll absolutely become obese in three months. Don't have a psychiatrist here (on waitlist) so I'm on my own for now.",1
"This has been a saga that started in mid January and I am at my wits end dealing with pain and insurance… 

34F dealing with debilitating lower back/hip/leg pain. I have ADHD (Adderall 30mg 2x/day) and IBS with gastritis. I also suspect I may have POTS and some form of hyper mobility or EDS but haven’t seen the rheumatologist yet. I am also in the maintenance phase of allergy shots going every other week. 

In mid January I did something, probably trying to pick up my 100 lb lab and my back started bothering me. I ignored it until early March when I went on a weekend camping trip that required me to sit in a car for hours. The pain skyrocketed. The following weekend I had a wedding to travel to so I made a virtual appt with my doc where I told her I thought it may be proximal hamstring tendinopathy since my hamstring was bothering me the most and felt tight to my foot and she prescribed me cyclobenzaprine (I think 10mg) to survive the weekend and sent me to physical therapy as well as a lumbar spine X-ray. 

The X-ray report comes back as unremarkable and I start pt at the end of March. 
My spring break was first week of April and I can barely get out of bed. I end up taking two weeks off work after that so I basically miss three weeks of work (I’m a teacher) and pt is not helping with pain. I was also switching back and forth between Tylenol and Advil but I have gastritis caused by NSAIDS and my stomach was starting to ache to I stopped the Advil. Also doing the stretching at home and ice and heat. I got an in person appt with another doc in my docs office April 10 and she puts in a request for a lumbar spine MRI and gives me a work note for a week. 

I try to work on April 17th and pain is so severe I barely make it through the day. After pt I went to urgent care and they give me a Toradol shot and Valium and a new prescription of cyclobenzaprine. That was the first night I was pain free. On the 19th insurance denies MRI request because I had only done 5 weeks of pt and not 6… I see another doc in my docs office on the 19th and she prescribes me hydrocodone-acetaminophen 5-325mg to help with pain and says I can try a cane for mobility support. She also sends me to get a hip X-ray since my hip and butt is where I feel most of the pain and it comes back unremarkable as well. She also prescribed diclofenac sodium 1% gel as a topical cream for pain but insurance still hasn’t approved it. 

I continue pt and did about 5 days of hydrocodone but the constipation was awful so I stopped taking it and saved it for bad moments. After the 6 weeks of pt was up they added on 8 more visits but it’s not helping anything. May 7th I’m back at urgent care with severe pain and they give me Valium and start me on 5 days of prednisone 40mg/day. 

May 13 I see orthopaedic surgeon and he’s confident it’s a herniated disc. He puts me on 300mg of gabapentin (one week just at night and now I’m on it twice a day) and ordered another MRI. He’s said since I’ve done all the other things I’m probably looking at an epidural shot or surgery to shave off the bulging disc. I was reading that laying down too long is bad for herniated discs but idk what else to do. Sitting is the worst and I had two wedding events this weekend that caused me so much pain I can barely walk. I also read that gabapentin can take awhile to start working. Is there anything else I can be doing to help the pain?

 It’s been 16 weeks now and I’m having anxiety attacks because of the level of pain I’m in. I’ve been taking Tylenol with the gabapentin because the pharmacist said to try not to mix the hydrocodone with it. I also have a trip at the end of June to Hawaii with my family and I’m worried about sitting on a plane for 6 hrs and then I have a cruise for a bachelorette weekend for my best friend and 11 hr flights to Ireland in July/august. I’m even willing to try unconventional treatments if they can help. The pain is absolutely horrific at times and I have never experienced an injury like this so I felt very lost navigating our messed up healthcare system. I will post xray pics in the comments and can include visit summary’s from the ortho surgeon and urgent care if necessary. If anyone has any tips or advice to help me that would be amazing. ",1
"Hi all, I’m a 29yo female, 125 lbs, 5”6. Currently on 60mg Zoloft, 30mg Lamictal, 15mg propranolol, 15mg Valium, 15mg Mirtazapine. Clonazepam (sublingual) PRN,  ondanestron PRN, propranolol PRN. 

I’ve had treatment resistant panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder since I was 8 (diagnosed, had symptoms earlier). Major depressive disorder since I was 23. Agoraphobia started around then too. Also IBS-D since I was a child, officially diagnosed after a scope in 2020. In 2022-2023 I had 4 recurrent CDI involving 2 hospitalizations and was officially diagnosed with PTSD from this. 

I have been on so many medications to try to treat these illnesses, as well as trying many types of therapy. I’ve seen 3-4 psychiatrists through my life, including specialists at a teaching hospital. I’ve had 10+ therapists.

Drugs I’ve been on since I was 8, and I may be forgetting some: (apologies for spelling)

SSRIs: Lexapro (worsened IBS), Prozac (worsened IBS), Zoloft, Celexa, Paxil, Viibryd

Atypical antidepressants: Wellbutrin, Mirtazapine

SNRIs: Pristiq (bad reaction), Cymbalta, Effexor

Tricyclic: Nortyptyiline (sp)

Atypical antipsychotics: Olanzapine, Seroquel, Risperdal (tardive dyskinesia), Rexulti (bad reaction- intrusive thoughts began), Abilify 

Mood stabilizers: Lamictal

Benzodiazepines: Lorazepam, Clonazepam, Diazepam (unwanted physical dependence’s) 

ADHD meds: Ritalin (dystonia), Adderal

Beta-blocker: Propranolol

Therapies I’ve tried: CBT, DBT, psychotherapy, family therapy, mindfulness, meditation, group therapy, exposure therapy, a PHP program and two IOPs.

My psychiatrist now wants me to replace Zoloft with trintellix. I’m currently in an IOP for the PD and MDD. I want to believe that we can find a medication that helps but it’s been 20 years of this with no luck and a lot of the time when I try new meds I have bad reactions. I stick with it to reach the therapeutic effects but they end up not helping and consuming my day. To be clear it’s not just me saying my symptoms aren’t being relieved, it’s my doctor too, saying that medication isn’t helping. 

When you have patients like me, do you truly think you can find a medication or a cocktail that will relieve symptoms? I am hopeful for improvement but realistically I’m thinking, why would something work now, whatever is going on hasn’t been helped. Why would my doc want to start me on a new med given every single other med has never worked?

"Ні,

I'm a white female. I’m 5’5” and 150lbs. I have HSD (and a ton of multi-systemic issues from the hypermobility), ADHD, MDD and GAD, as well as other various ailments. Former smoker (quit in my late 20’s) and regular medical marijuana user (mainly edibles) since I don’t want to take opioids (mother was an addict). 

Current meds are: Qunol CoQ10 100mg; Crestor 20mg; B-12/folate (methylated) sublingual; Cymbalta 60mg; Prilosec otc; Zyrtec otc; Famotidine otc; Wellbutrin XL 150mg; Vyvanse 30mg; vitamin D 5000iu 3 x a week; Guanfacine 1mg; Valacyclovir 1g; Ajovy injectable monthly; Nurtec ODT as needed for migraine; Valium as needed for anxiety.

Went to the GP for a checkup and after bloodwork I was prescribed Crestor 20mg for high total cholesterol and high triglycerides.
I started the Crestor in the evening on 5/6 in addition to Qunol brand CoQ10 100mg. I also started 1000mcg B-12/500mcg folate(methylated) that day. 
I’ve previously taken different brands of CoQ10 and B-12. 

On 5/10, I took my B-12/folate in the am. I noticed a rash that morning on my neck/ear that spread throughout the day. It consists of raised bumps with no redness or itchiness. I took 12.5mg diphenhydramine at 8pm on 5/10. 
Decided not to take CoQ10 or Crestor in PM on 5/10 and will not start up again until speaking to doc. Also stopping the B-12/folate, since it’s also new. On 5/11 in the AM, the rash is still present and has spread to my cheeks.

Other than the new meds, my routine has not changed and I haven’t tried any new foods, cleaners, body products etc. I don’t regularly get skin eruptions or rashes.

What is the likely culprit out of the new meds? If the Benadryl didn’t help should I keep taking it? Any advice or suggestions welcome.

I plan to call my doc Monday but it’s just freaking me out.

Hi all, this Friday I have a procedure for a Ballon Sinuplasty and fixing my deviated septum. The ENT clinic gave me my prescriptions that I am supposed to take 1 hour before my procedure. They want me to take 2 Valiums 10mg pills, 1 Promethazine 25mg tablet, and 1 5mg-325mg hydrocodone-acetaminophen pill (norco)

This was reading about mixing these medications and how you’re not supposed to mix Valium with Norco but I read other ENTs prescribe the same for their Balloon Sinuplasty but they only prescribe 1 Valium.

My question is, is taking all 4 pills 1 hour before my procedure safe to do? Is it overkill? I’m a little nervous about it. I wanted a second opinion on this",1
"Hello. I had a lot of stressful events happen close together in 2021, had an anxiety(?) attack out of nowhere while having dinner where I was taken to the hospital by ambulance (they couldn’t find anything wrong with me). After that I was stuck in fight or flight plus sensitive to small sounds (doors shutting, phones beeping etc I would feel my body jump inside). I got better in summer 2022.  I then started a new job with a bad boss in January 2023 and also was diagnosed with a 2cm meningioma in my left frontal lobe in April 2023 (4 neurologists have said my symptoms are not related) I went to the er during a stressful time at work because I had pressure in my forehead that I was told was a tension headache and incidentally found the meningioma. Since March of last year 2023, The “tight” feeling in my forehead has spread to my whole head, neck (knots/cables in neck since 04/23) and also my shoulders, back and chest. Even face  feels tight and back of throat. These areas are tight 24/7 (no relief) and when I’m anxious about it, it is much worse. Even the tops of my feet are stiff. I feel a heaviness in my legs but the muscles arent tight like in my neck. Also in addition to the constant stiffness, I get rotating “even tighter” stiffness that could be focused on the top of my head, in the base of my neck (like a baseball is in there), or even the front of my throat which will make it hard to swallow. When the tightness is focused in this area I find myself “clench” chewing my food and then my whole jaw and teeth will hurt). Ive tried acupuncture, massage, meditation, chiropractor (still going even that manipulation makes it worse) and many other things. I am sensitive to pressure so I can’t get massages that work on trigger points or I stiffen up even more. Massage therapist said my scm muscles are like I was in a whiplash accident (I wasn’t). I can’t go in hot tubs or have hot water from the shower head touch my chest or neck or it stiffens up even more. Even sunglasses on my head will make my head tighten and ache as soon as I put them on. I can’t press my back against anything (couch, bath tub, bed) or it stiffens up. Any emotional stressor (ie I got into an argument with a friend and I was so stiff the next day it felt like I was wearing cement from my forehead all the way throughout my lower back). I can’t stop worrying about it which doesn’t help. I was tested for stiff person syndrome by way of emg and gad 65 antibody but both were neg. Basically Dr thinks instead of presenting as chronic pain, it is stiffness but feels like it’s more than muscles stiffening, like fascia too . I take Valium and baclofen to sleep but doesn’t help the stiffness and was just prescribed LDN to try. I had to quit my job due to the symptoms.i have been off two months and about to run out of savings. The only thing that has gotten better since me quitting working for  the stressful boss is the daily fatigue and sick feeling is gone. But the stiffness progresses.    I have not met anyone anywhere yet that has my symptoms. I can’t exercise because certain neck or back movements make the stiffness/tight feeling worse (I have an indoor spin bike I use to love)  I had a cramp under my chin last week and I knew what that meant. The stiffness is now in my chest and neck all the way up to my chin where the cramp was ).  I hate that I can’t even take a deep breath anymore (I can breathe obviously). I am progressing by the week and every day I wonder what new symptom I am going to have when I wake up. Some days I wish I wouldn’t. I am 48 years old, single, no kids. I was an extremely happy person living my life in Las Vegas, NV for the past 8 years prior to this. Now I can barely leave the house because any stimulation makes me stiffen worse and about to run out of savings. I also went to mayo in Az and was told fibromyalgia but I don’t have a lot of pain, it’s stiffness. I might believe it but it’s progressing rapidly not just fluctuating.. Once an area gets tight once, it’s just another area to be stiff and there’s no going back. Any ideas or recommendations? I feel like  I’m in a nightmare that I can’t get out of.

"Tl; dr: I (30F, 5'7"", 190 lbs, Caucasian) had a horrible fall 4 years ago and over time my leg developed a bit of instability and then about 3 years ago it started spasming when weightbearing, but ALL the tests I’ve had come back essentially clean (in regards to potential causes of spasms, that is) and all my doctors are stumped. I’ve written out the following…

\-Backstory, explanation of leg symptoms, and the list of specialties I've already tried 
\-Excerpts (re: leg spasms) from office visits that I’ve had since then  
\-Diagnoses that I am certain it is NOT  
\-The complete list of what was caused by the fall  
\-My preexisting conditions  
\-Medications I was on when the leg symptoms started / have tried / am on now  
\-All the imaging / diagnostic tests / labs

(listed below in that order and with headings)  

I know that you guys aren’t my doctor and responding to this doesn’t create a doctor/patient relationship and all that jazz, but I’ve talked to at least 9 different specialties and a couple neurology sub-specialties and just don’t even know what other kind of doctor might be applicable or what other studies there even are that could address my symptoms and I’d just love any insights into what differential diagnoses you could think of \*that I would then discuss with my own doctors\*  
Thankfully the financial aspect of any additional treatment is more or less irrelevant because I hit my oop max every year (yay?)  


Backstory and explanation of symptoms  
I fell down a staircase almost 4 years ago and destroyed my body and one of the symptoms that we believe is related to it has stumped a whole lot of doctors (my PCP, my orthopedic surgeon, 2 physical therapists, 4 neurologists + 2 more that just did chart reviews and gave up, a spinal neurosurgeon, a podiatrist, a pain management doctor, a sports medicine orthopedic doctor, and a PM&R doctor).  
Generally speaking, I can walk without an issue. I do sometimes (2-3 times a month) use a cane for ambulation when my right leg feels a bit weak, when my left knee starts to hurt because my weight generally gets channeled through that leg when standing, and occasionally (less than once a month) when my right leg feels like it’ll give out on me or is spasming when walking.  
Standing, however, is a different issue. When I stand with both feet firmly on the ground and with my body weight centered between both legs, I get this uncontrolled motion where my heel lifts an inch or two off of the ground and kicks my knee forward and then goes back to being flat on the ground, and that motion repeats every few seconds. Physical Therapy + Gabapentin have helped enough that the symptoms are rarely an issue when walking and did decrease the severity of spasms and instability they cause when standing, but it’s still bad.  


Excerpts:  
\- Patient has developed some spasmodic clonus-like symptoms, right lower extremity, and she has recently had a sural nerve decompression on November 11, 2020 (dos: 12/08/20)  
\- States that it \[DeDuc clarification: the ankle\] feels stable and not completely weakened. Notes however that she has been losing strength \[DeDuc clarification: in the leg\]. Notes that when she tries to move it, it seems to shake and pulsate. States that it has made ambulation difficult. Notes that it will also send a shooting pain up to her midcalf.  
\- In regards to her ligamentous injury, it appears to be well healed and is stable. There is no ligamentous laxity and I don’t believe it is the cause of her current pain. I am greatly concerned she is having other related neural issues due to the clinic exam findings. She has seen a neurologist but notes that they haven’t don’t anything to work up her lower limb. As such, I recommended neuro referral for NCVs to the right lower leg to eval for possible radiculopathy. After consult, will better be able to understand the overall neural involvement. Until then, I did recommend continued work regarding PT for her lower leg should it evolve into RSD \[angry duck face\] type situation.  
\- On exam patient has ataxia on right side, she also has leg spasms when stationary and weightbearing. This happens when tired and multiple times during day \[DeDuc clarification: when standing\].  
\- The patient appears to have a nonglobal dyskinesis of musculature mostly affecting the anterior compartments of the thigh and the posterior compartments of the leg sparing the hamstrings and anterior compartment of the leg relatively.  
\- She has a normal joint exam of the hip and knee, ankle, and foot. I do not see any problem on exam with the musculoskeletal system. This does appear to be neurogenic in origin.  
\- When she stands in 1 place, her right leg has a large amplitude tremor  
\- She has idiopathic spasticity in the right leg. She has normal reflexes. She is able to demonstrate the onset of spasms as soon as she stands up. I cannot reproduce it when she is sitting down and trying to do quick movements of her ankle or knee.  
\- Her right leg spasms are essentially a form of dystonia. They are too generalized to do Botox injections. I would have her continue with medication management and we will see what the MRI of the thoracic spine shows  


Things that it is NOT  
It is NOT from polypharmacy. Yes, I currently take a lot of medication, but I ONLY took three different prescriptions when the symptoms started and have spoken with my pharmacist multiple times along the process of getting prescriptions for all of my other issues to confirm that it would be ok and have specifically asked them about spasms as potential side effects at least three of those times.  
It is NOT crps. I don’t have temperature, color/visual, texture, skin, hair, or nail changes, no sweating, no swelling, no loss of motor controls, and no excruciating uncontrollable pain - my nerve pain is almost entirely controlled by my gabapentin and L4-5 TESIs. I have a complicated presentation of pain (and spasms) in one region of my body, but it is NOT complex regional pain syndrome  


Complete List of Symptoms Caused by the Fall:  
Some of them seem irrelevant to me as a layperson, but I have learned that nerves are decidedly weird so I’m including everything from head to toe:  
\- Concussion and Post Concussive Syndrome (had concussion therapy, it mostly resolved)  
\- Vision issues (had vision therapy, it mostly resolved)  
\- Cervicogenic Headaches (get GONBs quarterly, take 25mg of amitriptyline daily and 10mg rizatriptan PRN)  
\- TMJ issues (left disc is displaced, right ligament is stretched out. Had the joint flushed out and injected with PRP in 2020. It still clicks and sometimes the right side shifts out of the socket (?) when I open my mouth but I was told surgery for the disc had a very low success rate and that hyperextension would be better than hypoextension for the ligament)  
\- Bulging disc at C4-5 (get ESIs every 4-6 months)  
\- Multilevel facet degeneration in my neck (get bilateral RFAs every 9-12 months)  
\- Bulging disc at L4-5 (get TESIs every 8-10 months)  
\- \*\*\*An undiagnosed presumed neurological issue with my right leg where it spasms when weightbearing or with exertion\*\*\*  
\- Nerve pain in my right leg (managed w/ L4-5 TESIs and Gabapentin)  
\- A grade 3 right ankle sprain and a bad scar between the ankle bone and heel that was extremely hypersensitive - made running water feel like stinging, and made wind / a fan cause stinging. I had the following surgeries performed on that ankle:  
\- Sx 1 – 03/18/20 – Lateral Ankle Reconstruction  
\- Sx 2 – 08/12/20 – Foreign Body Removal (the internal sutures were limiting ROM)  
\- Sx 3 – 11/11/20 – Sural Nerve Decompression  


Preexisting Conditions:  
ADHD – Combined  
Persistent Depressive Disorder  
Prediabetes (currently 5’7 @ 190 lb, was @ 260 lb in 2016 when diagnosed, but had symptoms from as far back as 2008 when I was 15 yo and weighed maybe 140 lb)  
Mild scoliosis dx as a child but never needed treatment for it  
Sleep apnea (diagnosed in 2018 when @ 260 lb. I’ve lost a lot of weight and have tried multiple kinds of masks but take my mask off when asleep so I gave up on the CPAP)  


Medications:  
This is ALL I take. I don't use any other licit or illicit drugs (other than stuff like Tylenol and cold meds and Tums/Pepto and the like as needed + an extremely rare 3-4 alcoholic drinks a year)  

When the symptoms started (and for the next 7 months that it took to get in with the neurologist who started me on gabapentin) I took:  
\-Methylphenidate 20 Mg  
\-Buproprion 450 Mg  
\-Metformin 500 Mg  

I have tried but didn’t particularly get any help from:  
\-Tizanidine 2 Mg  
\-Baclofen 10 Mg  
   
I’ve had a PM&R mention, but can’t take:  
\-Valium, because it would counteract my stimulant if I took it in the morning and taking it at night would essentially be useless because it’s not a restless-leg issue, it’s when standing, and I generally don’t stand up when asleep.  

That same PM&R mentioned (a month ago, and I told him I’d talk to my pain management guy which I did this week) :  
\-Dantrolene, however I’m a bit hesitant because my pain management guy who prescribes cyclobenziprene AND my pharmacist had never heard about it, it requires regular labwork when taking it, and the GI side effects are really rough. IDK, any comments on that medication would be appreciated  

At this point in time I take:  
Morning (after breakfast)  
\-Methylphenidate 60 Mg  
\-Gabapentin 300 Mg  
\-Metformin 500 Mg  
\-Diclofenac 75 Mg  
\-Bupropion 450 Mg  
\-Syeda  
\-B12 1,000 mcg  

After work  
\-Gabapentin 300 Mg  

At bedtime  
\-Gabapenin 300 Mg x2  
\-Diclofenac 75 Mg  
\-Metformin 500 Mg  
\-Amitriptyline 25 Mg (for migraine prevention. Yes, I am aware of the potential for serotonin syndrome because of my dose of bupropion, but I need it)  
\-Cyclobenzaprine 10 Mg  
\-Magnesium 500 Mg  
As needed  
\-Rizatriptan 10 Mg

"I have never posted before and hope I am doing this right:

40F diagnosed: depression, anxiety, gout, high blood pressure, heartburn.
Currently taking 10mg Prozac, 75mg trazadone, 300mg allopurinol, 20mg lisinopril, 40mg Nexium, and BC
Recently discontinued 75mg Effexor and 150mg Trazadone under dr supervision due to following:
Have been suffering with nausea (often times unbearable) shakes/chills/sweating, vomiting on and off and diarrhea on and off since Feb 2nd. All bloodwork so far good except sodium and potassium keep falling. Sodium is 125 for reference. Abdominal CT normal. Chest xray and EKG normal. Head CT normal.  Waiting for endoscope and colonoscopy. Negative for all tick illnesses and celiac's. 
*Here's the part that my docs are confused on: had been on effexor/trazadone combo for 24 years with zero issues. About a week and a half into this mystery illness, i started noticing my effexor making me violently ill. I went to the ER twice because about 2-3 hours after taking it, i had muscle spasms, sweating/shivering/uncontrollable shaking, extreme nausea, clenching my jaw, amd confusion. I really thought i was dying. Anti-nausea meds (zofran, promethazine) made it 1000 times worse. Was given valium and discharged with instructions to see a psychiatrist if i thought it was my Effexor/trazadone. (All vitals were good, except slightly elevated HR, and they had GSWs and people dying - apparently I just felt like I was dying)
I can tell psychiatrist and PCP are not sold on theory that symptoms were made worse by Effexor/trazadone, but PCP did take me off Effexor and put me on 10mg of Prozac. Pyschiatrist tried to up the prozac to 20mg, but...nausea, muscle spasms, etc. increased.
Have almost constant nausea and anxiousness/irritability now, not able to work approx 2-3 days/week due to this. Nausea is debilitating sometimes.
Things that are or have made symptoms worse: benadryl, Tylenol, Hydroxyzine, Buspirone
The only thing that temporarily helps symptoms: Atavan (yes, very aware how dangerously addictive this can be, try not to take it except maybe once a day, if that)
Was previously taking lisinopril and htz for blood pressure, but recently discontinued by PCP because blood pressure is now low. (Have lost 57lbs since 2 FEB)
Waiting on endoscope and colonoscopy, but GI doc hasnt offerred any insight on what may be going on and when i mentioned the medication issue she told me to follow up with my psychiatrist and PCP for issues with medication. 
Any recommendations for additional tests? My psychiatrist and PCP seem stumped, and i am so miserable.
 am sorry if I don't word or post this correctly, I've never posted on Reddit before, but am desperate. 

Also, sorry for the novel.

Edit to original post: Forgot that I am also on sucralfate. It doesn't seem to be helping anything but its not making me sicker (at least I don't think so?)

" Hello everyone.

My first post is a desperate request for help.  
My husband has been battling a mysterious illness/disease, wtv you want to call it for over a year now, no clue to what it is and the worst is we can’t even treat the symptoms.

He is a 32-year-old man, 1.81m and 90kg - Does not drink or use drugs. Portuguese Nationality.  
The symptoms are strong discomfort on the chest area followed by what we can only describe as spasms on the middle chest area, a few times all the way up to the throat, sometimes it causes pain on a parallel line to the back, a few times tingling on the arms and always but always crazy burping. Super long and strong burps.  
These crises are impairing as the spasms are super strong and painful, make him cringe all the way down, if driving has to stop the car, already has limitations on his work and we cannot find the reason for this.  
The pattern is absolutely random. It happens when working, when exercising, when relaxing, waking up in the middle of the night with pain, sitting down, standing up, no matter the time of day, eating, drinking etc. Absolutely no pattern.  
 

We have done all the medical testing and gone to all the specialists.  
Gastroenterology – 2 specialists:  
Abdominal X-ray;  
Endoscopy;  
Manometry and Esophageal PHmetry  
H.Pylori tests from endoscopy and stool sample.  
 

Cardiovascular - 2 specialists:  
Stress-test with Electrocardiogram;  
Echocardiogram;  
Angio CT with contrast;  
Doppler;;  
Pulmonary CT;  
Doctor informed could be a neurologic spasm issue – prescribed Venlafaxine to treat possible neurological spasm – did not work.  
 

Blood tests of all kinds – all found to have low good cholesterol.

Internal Medicine has no answer for it.  
Went to Physiotherapy – suggested some tension on diaphragm – did some massages – nothing  
changed.

The Family Medicine practitioner insists on anxiety, so we went to a Psychiatry specialist.  
The Psychiatrist removed Venlafaxine  and prescribed Vortioxetine, taking over a month now – no effect whatsoever.  
He has been prescribed many meds to take as SOS in these crisis moments, none of the worked, the symptoms to not go away when taking them:

Valium;  
Victan;  
Flindix;  
Nifedipine;  
Muscle relaxant;  
Also did gastric protector for 1 month – nothing changed.  
All the exams came back normal except for the Angio Tac which showed an atheromatous plaque taking 20% of an artery – started exercise, lost 16kg (now with 90kg) and nothing changed.  
Due to this atheromatous plaque it was advised to start Rosuvastatin + Aspirin as a preventive measure until the end of life.

We have run out options and are not even able to treat the symptoms let alone find the issue. We have no idea what to do and we are desperate for a solution.  
Does this make sense to any one?  
Does anyone relate to this, has seen/heard about something similar that could help us?

Thanks.",1
"I’m 20F, 5’5, 136lbs. I’m on Valium 5mg twice a day but usually only taken once a day, seroquel, and lamictal. I had to cut out caffeine when I was 17 after starting lexapro (not longer on it), it would give me panic attacks and make me groggy. As of lately I’ve been trying to reintroduce from time to time. Usually only a few sips of a friend or fami
ly’s drink. It’s usually fine, it might make me feel a little tired but no panic. I got too cocky yestefrday and drank a full cup of sweet tea. It was just way too much caffeine. I didn’t feel panicky after the cup, only sleepy so I thought I was in the clear. This morning I woke up shaking with the oh so familiar tightness in my chest along with a more depressed mood. This has been reoccurring when I have too much caffeine. I’ll be fine the whole day but the next day I really feel the affects of it. I do struggle with panic disorder but I have for the majority of my life and was still able to tolerate caffeine. If anyone has any insight it would be greatly appreciated ",1

Hi, I am changing from Xanax to clonazepam because the tolerance from Xanax had gotten ridiculous and I didn’t want to end up on the road of increasing the dose (which my psychiatrist won’t do anyway) until I am in a full blown horrible situation, I feel like I’m going insane. I started on 1mg Xanax a day in Feb 2023 and 0.5mg would knock me out. It worked so well until about August / September. By that point I was on 3mg a day, 4mg on really bad days. Fast forward to now, I was still on 3mg a day, occasionally 4mg. But I was at the point I was stretching the dose as long as possible because I knew I would be lucky to get an hour out of it. I just suffered. It was lucky if 2mg deescalated me from a flashback or panic attack. So I made the decision to ask my psychiatrist to change me to clonazepam, I was crying and told him I was terrified but want my mental state to improve, so he was a bit hesitant as he thought it wouldn’t go well as I have such severe anxiety and I am trying to return to work. But he understood my concerns and put me on 2mg clonazepam a day. He gave me the option to switch straight over or cross taper. I felt confident to switch straight over as I’ve tried most other benzos except lorazepam and some other less known ones. I used to be on 0.5mg clonazepam with a previous crappy psychiatrist. 

Anyway I started the clonazepam Monday and the first two days were great but Wednesday things started to go downhill. During the day I was ok but at night I fell apart and relapsed. I ended up deciding to cross taper but I was already taking the 2mg clonazepam by this point. So I took 2mg Xanax and it was like neither of them did ANYTHING AT ALL. it has been like this every day since and only getting worse. I also know that technically 1mg Xanax = 1mg clonazepam and I’m now on a lower dosage. However there’s conflicting information about this (I.e. that clonazepam dosage is lower) but for someone with high tolerance it would likely be on the higher side.

I tried to contact my psychiatrists office but he’s in high demand so replied to my email saying to go to my GP to sort it out, which is fine as in Aus Xanax is a Schedule 8 (tricky for GPS) clonazepam is a schedule 4 which isn’t as much of an issue. I’m wondering what to do now because I feel like clonazepam is doing nothing but I spoke to the crisis team and they said that usually people are tapered off Xanax WAY SLOWER. Like down by 0.5mg a month. My psychiatrist didn’t necessarily say I couldn’t taper but he knows I am very self efficacious with medications. 

Has anyone else had a similar issue? What did you do? Did you try valium, temazepam or lorazepam instead? I really want some hope things are gonna get better. Part of me is just like go back on the Xanax and suck it up, the devil you know I guess.

FYI I have CPTSD, BPD, GAD, MDD, Autism & ADHD and chronic health issues (FND, Hypothyroidism - I was born without a thyroid.)
Also on lamotrigine 250mg, pristiq 100mg, thyroxine 150mg, compounded t3 6mcg, propranalol 10mg tds, vyvanse 40mg & Dex 5mg bd. I take Thorne multivitamins - b12, iron byglycinate, magnesium, chromium and trace minerals, zinc Picolinate, vitamin c, fish oils and compounded d3,
I vape and drink responsibly. Nil other substances.

Please don’t shame me or lecture me about benzos - I know all of the risks and side effects. I don’t want to be on benzos forever but at the moment I’m trying to keep myself alive, avoid homelessness and losing my job. There aren’t other medication options for me at this point.",1
"Greetings fellow Redditors and Doctors! As the title suggests my nephew is suffering from vomiting and high temperature ranging from 100-103 over past few days (6 days to be exact). So, it started with a vomiting, before which he was perfectly fine and active showing no symptom of any disease. After sometime he drank water and immediately vomited again. Been given Syp. Motilium (Domperidone) which he threw out as well. In short, he vomited 6 times in those 3 hours. Meanwhile, his body was warmer than usual and the thermometer was hitting 100 on the Celsius scale. Took him to the Doc who injected him with Oxidil (Ceftriaxone) 500mg along with Flagyl (Metronidazole) via DNS drip, and given Syp Panadol and Syp. Motilium (Domperidone). His condition remained same till next day besides his temperature increased to 103 and the vomiting continued (he would vomit even if he drank one sip of water); the same treatment continued for the next day. Seeing him not getting any better, we took him to another Doctor whose prescriptions I have attached below in the photos. Nevertheless, I’ll mention here in text as well what he injected him with (details of which you can see in the prescription photo attached). It was Inbufin (Ibuprofen) (400ma/100ml), then Medisol (compound sodium lactate, intravenous infusion BP (Ringer-lactate) 500ml alongwith onset injection mixed into it. Besides that, he prescribed Merisol (Meropenum USP) (500mg/vial) injection twice a day, Decadron (Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate USP) (4mg/ml), Gen-M (Artesunate) (30mg). This was the third day of his treatment but he wasn’t showing a sign of recovery instead he started to show neuropsychiatric signs (such as calling his mother with a different name, becoming extremely fearful, making facial expressions that he doesn’t normally do, and shouting; I cannot explain for the lack of better words), and he slept very little and kept crying for as long as he remained awake, with an atrabilious behavior. So at the night the doctor had to give him tablet valium (Diazepam) 3mg, after which he could sleep for only 4 hours and woke up crying and continued crying. On this day his vomiting stoped and for some hours his temperature was showing normal (which again rose to 100 that day, and to 102 the next day). We stayed there for two days but discontinued because things were not getting better. The next day we took him to another doctor who prescribed different medications (I’ll attach this in the photos and write Doc #3 on the photo). We are back home now, he was active in the day but he has started to vomit again (he vomited 5 times previous night). I am here to ask what do y’all have to say about this -and what do you suggest?",1

I got really dizzy at work last Sunday, January 28th. At first I thought I was vagaling and took 8mg zofran. I'm an ED nurse so I waited for coverage and signed in. Original Thought was an atypical migraine and got the migraine cocktail and felt better-ish. Called out Tuesday bc I was still dizzy. Wednesday my PA told me to do vestibular PT, a prednisone taper and continue the meclizine prescribed. 

I Went to work Thursday. I felt alright meaning my balance wasnt off but still dizzy. I took 25mg meclizine at 8am. Around 2 pm, I was eating with colleagues. I got dizzy and couldn't feel my left jaw. Before I said anything people were asking if I was okay and said i had a left facial droop. Got checked in and avoided a stroke alert. I was given the migraine cocktail again but it didnt work. They added on valium 2.5mg ivp. I was dry heaving and felt like i was upside down. Nothing was touching this. I had a head ct that was negative, admitted to obs, mri negative. Cleared by neuro. Hospitalist said we would work on a plan for discharge. I failed ambulatory trial so pt couldn't epley me or anything. My nurse came in and told me to find a ride and gave me my papers. I was getting scheduled Valium IVP the whole time and was so messed up. I thought I would get to try PT again before discharge. They gave me a script for valium and vestibular pt.

I haven't been able to  walk well since. I stumble or crawl. PT today said my symptoms were too severe for treatment. I begged him to epley me and then projectile cried when it didn't work. He trialed me with a cane which was better than a walker and told me to see ENT. 

I had already called ENT because Saturday night I couldn't hear well out of my right ear and tinnitus started. ENT said they could see me July 23rd. I am a healthy 35 yo, single mom. I went from working out with a trainer to buying a cane and trying to not have to walk the 10 terrifying steps to the bathroom or kitchen. This is not functional.

Is there something else I can do? What am I missing? The ed attendings didn't agree with bppv but that's what the hospitalist and neuro agreed was the cause. PT disagrees. I've left messages with every hospital ENT in the area (Penn, temple, jeff). 

Tl;dr: got dizzy, got meds, got scans, still can't ambulate with steady gait",1
"I have a slap tear in my shoulder. I tore it last May. I did physical therapy for 4 months with no improvement. Was put on valium and naproxen, nothing. Tried cortisone injection,  nothing. Just had trigger point injections, and it still hurts in the back of my shoulder. Orthopedic surgeon was worried he would get in there and it wouldn't be bad enough to fix but I've had enough pain at this point. Are there any other options?


Mri results:

Impression
1. Apparent sequela from anterior shoulder dislocation including subcentimeter Hill-Sachs impaction fracture deformity at the posterior aspect of the humeral head with additional mild cortical irregularity at the anterior glenoid with overlying nondisplaced anterior labral tear.
2. Additional likely tearing at the posterior labrum, as described above, could be more accurately assessed with MRI arthrogram as deemed clinically appropriate.
3. Mild infraspinatus tendinosis.
4. Minimal degenerative change at the acromioclavicular joint.


Narrative
INDICATION: Right shoulder pain subsequent to seizure May 2023. No reported history of right shoulder surgery

COMPARISON: Correlation with right shoulder radiographs 9/7/2023

FINDINGS:

Rotator cuff: Intermediate signal intensity within the infraspinatus tendon is consistent with mild tendinosis. The remaining rotator cuff tendons are normal appearing. There is minimal fatty infiltration of the teres minor muscle. There is no reduced bulk or fatty infiltration of the remaining rotator cuff musculature.

Labrum: There is blunting and irregularity at the free edge of the posterior labrum with additional irregularity at the posterior chondral labral junction consistent with tear. There is linear increased T2 signal within the anterior labrum consistent with nondisplaced tear.

Biceps: The contour, course, caliber, and signal of the long head of biceps tendon is within normal limits.

Cartilage/Bone: There is a small cortical concavity within the posterior aspect of the humeral head measuring 3 mm AP by 3 mm transverse by 6 mm craniocaudal consistent with a small Hill-Sachs impaction fracture. There is also mild cortical irregularity at the anterior glenoid with minimal subchondral cystic change. There is slight posterior decentering of the humeral head relative to the glenoid. No definite glenohumeral cartilage thinning. Trace joint effusion.

Acromioclavicular joint: There is minimal degenerative change at the acromioclavicular joint. The undersurface of the acromion is relatively flat. The coracoclavicular ligament is intact.

Others: There is a trace amount of fluid in the subacromial subdeltoid bursa. There are subcentimeter axillary lymph node.",1
"55f weight unknown 5’4

i’m not sure if this is the right place to ask but i’ve been going crazy over it. my mom was 55 and passed in her sleep 3 weeks ago. i asked my dad to make sure they did some kind of testing because i, of course, wanted to know why she died. apparently they didn’t, and nobody told me that her death certificate came in until i was meeting with the attorney about her and she mentioned it. 

on her death certificate, it basically said she died of heart disease complicated by alcohol abuse. my mom was a long time heavy and frequent drinker and i definitely assumed that played a factor in her passing so young. her father passed away in his 60’s from a heart attack. apparently they only briefly spoke with her PCP about her passing and that’s what they decided on. 

the thing is that my mom had a history of mixing valium with alcohol. on a tuesday, she showed up to work “disoriented” (which i think may be a nice way of saying drunk, but she always remained sober for work) and was sent home. nobody heard from her after that and she was found on that friday. 

nobody else in my family seems bothered that there was no testing to find out the exact reason she died and she was cremated so i’m kind of at a loss right now. should i just trust what they decided on? i hadn’t spoken to my mom in a few years so i didn’t really know what was going on in her life. they do do this for a living, but it has been very hard for me to accept.",1
"I'll start off by saying this happened last night in vienna, where i am currently for my vacation.

frequent benzodiazepine and thc use, smoker, asthma and pollen allergy. 3 years of infrequent and mild hallucinations.

it happened around 9 pm. i took a cbd cookie around 7 pm and had no reaction, i wasn't high. i used weed many times before that. this didn't contain thc and i bought it legally. it started off by me losing feeling in my throat and the roof of my mouth. my whole body kept getting more and more numb, i had extreme heart palpitations and i was slowly losing consciousness. when the ambulance got there i was losing my ability to speak and I was almost entirely passed out. i had a distorted perception of time, and those 15 minutes felt like 5 hours. 

when they got me into the ambulance car i started getting the worst hallucinations of my life which kept getting gradually worse. i was seeing thousands of tiny little pictures like flowers and butterflies, both when my eyes were open and not. it got to the point where i was entirely in a different dimension and it lasted for 4 hours until i got back into reality. i heard voices calling me, saw creatures trying to kill me, i was in many different settings like the beach and different places. of course, i didn't know i was hallucinating. i remember screaming because i thought a creature with an arrow trying to kill me.

something that I can't explain myself is the muscles spasms. my body kept making these crazy involuntary movements, i was throwing around my legs and arms, trying to break the hospital bed, at one point i put both my legs onto my head. i couldn't stop moving like that.

they told me i should see a psychiatrist and told me this was just a panic attack. I'm concerned about the delusions and hallucinations and also loss of consciousness. i do hallucinate from time to time, but it never, ever got this bad. 

in the hospital they put me on iv valium, which i was getting for an hour or more.

i was wondering what this could be? I'm seeing a psychiatrist in two weeks, but I'd appreciate someone letting me know their thoughts so i can be calm.",1
"17 female, 5'4, 55kg, white, I have OCD, health anxiety, and depression, I am on fluoxetine and sporadic valium, non smoker or drinker.

So basically, I came down with a cold (which also caused me to vomit) and which caused my health anxiety to relapse and ever since then Ive had weird gastro symptoms, mayb a bit before 2.

 It started simply with a bit of indigestion, but then became nausea, pain under my ribs (in the middle when i breath and press it), heart burn, bloating and belching, and my poop smells awful. Also my intestines r burning and I feel like I need to poop A LOT. When I do poop it smells HORRIFIC BRUH. The nausea kinda feels like its in my throat. Im super worried its something serious like cancer, (bowel or stomach) even though im only 17, as it has been occuring for days.

 Im not really eating much due to the worry of these symptoms, but also because (despite being hungry) i feel a 'block' to eating as i am in discomfort. Since my health anxiety relapsed i have seeked constant reasurrance from medical professionals (for various complaints) and in the past month ive received so much testing, like 5x blood tests, EKG, a head CT, an abdominal and pelvic ultrasound (for these complaints + because i thought there was blood in my stool and my doctor thought he felt a mass under my belly button, turns out it wasn't a mass and the blood was just dark brown food? i think? both tests came back normal, but im not sure if they checked my stomach on the ultrasound? The tech mostly just went up and down the middle of my tummy and around the area the ""mass was supposed to be. Im not sure if thats common practice to see everything). 

I also had my poop tested, which came back normal, and 2x normal urine tests + physical exams. ALL NORMAL but im worried they missed something or cant pick something up with the tests they did, for example gastroparesis.

I went to the doctor irl again today and he told me to take some gavascon and gave me a referral for more ultrasound/blood test (I didnt tell him I alr had them done before, thinking it should be fine then but maybe he would've ordered others if I told him that?). I took the gavascon and it kinda helped but I still feel a bit burnt inside and it came back quite quickly (reflux).

 Im exhausted by my anxiety and this predicament, and honestly havent been exercising, eating well, drinking well, or taking care of myself, which ig could be a cause of the symptoms??. Im trying to convince myself this is why these symptoms have been occurring, but they are so prolonged, and if anything was wrong, wouldn't they have found it on the scans, but im worried they didnt test for blood in my poop (the doctor said no blood but i honestly think he mightve forgotten to test for it and just said that). Im just super worried i have either cancer or some other disease like GERD or gastroparesis. I waited for gastric emptying to occur (2 hrs) yesterday and then forced myself to throw up. It was mucusy, only a bit of digested food and 2 hours later just acid so idk about delayed gastric emptying.

I can eat and im not vomiting but the other day i ate mall sushi and it made me feel nauseous asf (i hadn't eaten for the whole day and scoffed it down). I proceeded to feel nauseous, have an anxiety attack, and then throw up, cant tell if it was from nausea or panic, and since then these symptoms have got a lot worse. i cant tell if its because im hyperfocusing or not and i feel like such an idiot. i feel like my stomach is super irritated and tender, and sometimes when i sit up or move fast i feel woozy, so basically i dont even wanna get up. + when I press my stomach it makes the most awful gurgling noise from all the gas moving inside and I am FARTING LIKE HELL. Honestly, mentally, i dont know how to keep going w/ these constant health worries. Ive been to the Dr and hospital so many times and they don't take me serious anymore. Im starting to get a bit suicidal and, despite being on meds, they dont really work but i dont have access to a psychiatric appointment for months and my next counselling appointment is in december due to high demand and low resources. 

Can anyone help me calm down/reassure me if there was a problem it would have been detected? Is it possible for someone my age to just get a serious gastro disease like this or even cancer like gastric lymphoma? could this be mental health related? Any help would be so appreciated by me at this time as idk what to do next or ask the doctor for. but im not sure. Also I predominantly wake up nausous in the morning and it gets a bit worse after eating. Ik i sound like a hypochondriac but my stomach hurts sm :( also sometimes my throat clicks i can feel this clicking and a bit of abdomen pain when bending + gurgling in my eosphagus 

feeling like im about to be in my sarcophagus 😭

Should I ask for more testing, like an abdominal CT?? ",1

"17F, 5""4, 55kg, on fluoxetine and valium, diagnosed with OCD.

Ive been experiencing

- bloating, belching
- abdominal burning pain (lower abdomen but can go higher)
- bright red blood on outside of stool once (idk if blood or something i ate? Looked bloody). - I checked for hemmeorids and found nothing.
- foul smelling poop. 
- hurts to poop. (Poop is pretty smooth and soft and runs outta me). 
- nausea. 
- acid reflux/indigestion. 
-  black specs in poop.(dried blood????)
- pain in appendix when pressed and slight pain sometimes when not 

Went to Dr and he ordered bloods/abdominal ultrasound/poop culture 3 weeks ago for the first symptoms (before any pain). Said all was normal but he forgot to do the occult poop test... so idk abt the blood. Also im a bit iron deficient (im vegan, but haemoglobin normal on bloods). 

Im worried its cancer or some other disease. Went to another doctor today and they pressed my appendix, it really hurt so they told me to go to the ER. When I got there they did bloods, urine, and a physical exam (said 0 infection markers and likely not appendicitis, gave me an ultrasound referral and sent me home + it hurts less now when the doctor at the hospital pressed it it barely hurt). They reassured me any issue would be detected on my prior abdominal and pelvic ultrasound (including cancer) but isn't an ultrasound basically useless for stomach and intestinal issues?? 

I just wanna know is there a possibility of some form of cancer... im so scared the discolouration in my poop is blood. There was none this morning but idk. My doc said it was not IBD and to eat better/exercise but the pain is pretty bad... ik colon, appendix, or stomach cancer at this age would literally get me published in PubMed (im 17) but im still scared . Would the ultrasound and bloods actually have picked it up? hoping to get an ultrasound tmrw on my appendix and colon specifically (will ask them to look at my stomach too) and hopefully a CT or something to check for any other abnormalities (im not sure anymore which tests are most appropriate for these issues? Mayb seeing specialist also). Im just so tired...and this process will probably take days so I just thought I'd post for some reassurances bc my mind is basically convincing me CANCER CANCER CANCER, or some other disease. (Im also worried of appendix c since it clearly wasn't appendicitis). Any help would be so appreciated.",1

"

So a few months back I did a full everything cleanse to re-evaluate my medication regiment. I did a thing called GeneSight testing where it looks at your DNA and determines the best medications for you. 

I was on Lexapro and then transitioned to Zoloft. Both where in the red section of “Do not take, severe drug interactions” so I stopped them.

The withdrawal process was hard but I was fine during it, actually felt pretty good.

Now my anxiety is back with a vengeance, probably the strongest it’s been in years. I can’t stop my thoughts, I’m constantly worried, constantly afraid I’ll just stop breathing or that my hearts gonna stop. My weight isn’t making it any better but it’s really hard to go to the gym when when you think and feel like your heart is about to stop at any given moment and that you’re gonna stop breathing 

( I did manage to jog 2 miles this week and lift some in the gym before losing my shit to anxiety and panic attacks but that’s a different story and I guess a success?)

So my psychiatrist has prescribed me buspirone at 5mg a day twice a day until my next appointment with her on July 1st. Today marks exactly 2 weeks taking it.

Now I’m not sure what exactly I’m feeling. Some days I have horrendous panic and anxiety. In fact I am anxious right now. Others I am okay. But the fact remains I’m still having some bad anxiety. Which lead me find a few Reddit threads about how Buspar made the anxiety worse or it was one of those “it helps or it don’t” meds. 

Do I stick it out until the 1st? That’s about 2 weeks out? Have I just not given it time to fully get into my system? I mean I’m a big dude at 6’ 4” 400lbs maybe 5mg just isn’t a noticeable dosage? Maybe that’s why it’s not in my system. I want to believe the medication helps me manage my issue. I know there is never truly going to be a cure or outright solution to anxiety but I want to have hope that I haven’t wasted the last 2 weeks trying something that ultimately failed.

And of course in the side effects is that it may make anxiety worse but it’s rare. Is my intrusive thoughts making me think I’m the special rare case? Why am I constantly worried about it

I’m looking for consensus",1
"I’ve never taken an anxiety med or antidepressant before but have been battling severe depression and anxiety for a few years now. Finally went to the doctor yesterday and was prescribed 10mg lexapro once a day (I’m taking it at night) along with 5mg buspar to be taken twice a day. Just took both for the first time about 2 and a half hours ago but am now kind of freaking out because in trying to educate myself a bit on each drug I found out that they are advised to not be taken together due to serotonin syndrome risk. I know I have a tendency to be kind of a hypochondriac but now I’m getting kind of anxious and can’t tell if I have symptoms or not. If anyone has any advice or knows that I did something wrong that I should know about (like taking both for the first time at the same time) please lmk.

Edit: the other thing that I didn’t mention was that I’m a daily weed smoker, I asked my dr before hand if I should quit and he said to try to taper down but not to worry about going cold turkey or anything, so I smoked a bit tn assuming it would be better to not have to suddenly adjust to no weed and new meds at the same time. I don’t mean for any of this to come across as seeking medical advice I would just like some insight as to wether I should actually be concerned or not ",1
I have an appointment with a therapist or honestly I’m not sure what he’s  called but someone to talk to about my anxiety and ocd with . I have really bad anxiety mostly triggered towards health and germs . I wash my groceries from the store I wipe them down with Lysol wipes I wipe anything and everything ever touched by anyone else it’s to the point it’s all I think about and stops me from going anywhere or getting near anyone I basically lost a lot of friends because my fear of germs and how uncomfortable I make people who even have the slightest sniffle  . I’m very much against meds particularly antidepressants I’ve been doing research and read buspar is the safest anxiety med that’s not a ssri and mainly just helps with anxiety so is it a good med ? Does anyone had any positive reviews on it ? If I may note I usually get mental changes after having a baby with my first daughter I had severe depression I just had a baby 5 months ago and now have severe anxiety it goes away or eases up after the first year I noticed so that’s another reason I don’t wanna get on antidepressants and just something light to help with my anxiety I wanna feel normal I miss the old me I know it’s also cold and flu season which is also triggering for me but being this bad is not normal,1
"10mg lexapro in the morning and 7.5 buspar three times a day.

I started both meds two weeks ago for anxiety. I dont really have physical symptoms or panic attacks, just a general feeling of anxiety and anxious thoughts. Like the feeling of having anxiety actually causes more anxiety.  

The first week it seemed I was starting to feel better but suddenly the second week (the last few days) my anxiety is flaring up again. Especially in the mornings and early afternoon.

About to start my third week and I’m worried about the meds not working or what if I start feeling worse?

I just need to hear some success stories about these meds and how long they took to start feeling better and normal. 

Does it get a bit worse before it gets better?

"So I am diagnosed bipolar 1, but have suspected possible ADHD for years. I just started seeing a new psychiatrist at the beginning of the month. He asked a lot of questions, all of which I answered honestly. I made sure to describe some of my symptoms that make me believe I may have ADHD as well, but most of his questions revolved around the bipolar disorder. He did acknowledge at the end of the appointment that it sounds like I may be dealing with “some sort of attention problem”, but said we needed to tackle the bipolar first. I understood completely, and have been taking abilify and also buspar for anxiety. Since the appointment, I’ve been much more aware of my symptoms and trying to keep track of them. I have realized just how strongly I believe I have ADHD and how much it has impacted my day to day life. I struggle holding down a job, I have great difficulty completing small tasks, trouble in relationships, etc. I want to bring this up at my appointment next week, but am scared he is going to think I am med seeking. I disclosed to him my struggle with alcoholism, so my biggest worry is he’s going to think “oh this girl just wants some legal drugs”. While I’d be very open to medication, that is not the case. I just want to think and feel like a normal person, and not feel so lazy/incompetent in my work and home lives. Sorry I think this turned more into a rant but I’d love some advice on what I should say to my doctor to stress the importance of getting diagnosed and starting treatment. Also I’m 26f. Thank you ",1

I tried antidepressants a few weeks ago (remeron) but it made me feel dumbed down and weird so I stopped. I took all the ssris and cymbalta in my teenage years and none helped. I’ve taken buspar and hydroxyzine but don’t like being on pills, they make me feel detached and not real. Being sober is so empty but it’s better than feeling nothing on meds. I have no insurance and no money for a dr. It’s not like they could do much, I’ve been on pills and even did ketamine for fucks sake… went from 136-116 and hate who I am today.

I’ve tried other forms of therapy like solo trips, reading books, exercising, and art but the “good feelings” never last long. My brother recently tried ayahuasca and he said it was great for his mental health. He’s been trying to convince me try it but I also have an addictive personality and if I put myself in certain environments (physically or mentally) I abuse drugs/alcohol. I’m also afraid that it wont work and I’ll just waist my time and money. I’ve taken a physiological exam (mmpi) and it came back inconclusive (which was so disappointing). I really thought that my issues were purely adhd and depression but now that I’ve tried several things to try to resolve it I’m loosing hope. Sometimes I feel like I’m too self-aware…. or maybe I’m just crazy. Im also extremely sensitive and stubborn and I hate asking for help. I just want to get to the bottom of my issues and figure out why I’m so depressed. I don’t want to feel this way anymore. Actually I don’t want to feel at all. I feel like a burden. I just want to love my life. What is my purpose. What is the value of life? Who am I? What do I do? Why do I hate myself so much? I want to feel okay, I want to feel normal. With every day that passes, it’s also starting to look darker and darker for me. Any tips, tricks, or suggestions would be great.",1
"So I had an injury about 10 years ago and required multiple spinal fusions to remedy nerve damage in my pelvis and leg. I have micro spasms in my pelvic muscles that squeeze my prostate and bladder and can keep them irritated for 90% of the day when it happens. These spasms randomly occur but can be brought upon from anything ranging from anxiety(clenching) subconsciously, sitting upright for too long, or even lifting something that makes me strain. Anyways, I’ve been put on every medication known to man until they found a cocktail that worked. I was on gabapentin for years but recently changed to Lyrica for nerve pain, a muscle relaxer(baclofen), and Klonopin. Their reason for the klonopin was that it will keep my subconscious anxiety at bay (never had a problem with actual anxiety), was told it was an excellent muscle relaxer, and lastly while I was having my groin pain it would basically make me care about it less. I never would have guessed it but it actually works great, better than opiates imo. I’ve also tried Ativan, Valium, and Xanax, but the klonopin did the best. However, over the last few years on klonopin I have noticed that I’ve lost interest in everything I once enjoyed. My friends ask me out but I’d rather stay home, I LOVED video games but now I can’t even get myself in the mood to turn them on. I’ve even lost all interest in dating or even attempting to talk to women. I’ve never had a problem with depression which I was starting to think it was, considering I can’t work anymore and most my friends have moved on, not to mention the constant pain. However, my doctor has tried me on anti-depressants but I don’t really think I gave them long enough because I felt they made my emotions worse. We tried amitryptiline, Prozac, Cymbalta, and Wellbutrin. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced this from Klonopin and what countered it, since I have to take it for the pain. I’m on 1mg 3x a day but I only really take it once a day since it lasts so long, but never more than twice a day. My mom has had great experience with buspar, which she said can be used for depression but I haven’t talked to my doctor about it yet. Sorry so long but that’s my story in a nutshell. Any input would be greatly appreciated. ",1
"I was recently diagnosed with TLE (temporal lobe epilepsy) and went off my usual SSRI’s because they weren’t working. My psychiatrist was hesitant to prescribe me anything else until I saw a neurologist and got my diagnosis, as many other antidepressants/antianxiety meds can make you more prone to seizures.

I will say I’ve only ever had two tonic clonic seizures about a month apart, and they both happened while I was sleeping. I’ll occasionally get the sudden aura/deja vu feeling, but I’ve been on Keppra for 3 months and haven’t really experienced the symptoms or a seizure in a while (as far as I know).

I started Lexapro back in January after I had my first seizure. All of my scans and EEGs came back normal so the ER doc suggested that it might have been caused by my anxiety and that I should see a psychiatrist. He put me on Lexapro and I had never felt more normal in my life for about a month. I noticed my anxiety was creeping back in so we upped my dose, which made me incredibly depressed and despondent so we stopped it. I went on Buspar for a week, and I couldn’t handle it even at 5 mg. It made me so dizzy and tired I couldn’t go to work or class.

So then I went on Zoloft, 25 mg for 3 weeks. It did absolutely nothing. It made me more anxious, more depressed, and made me gain a lot of weight very quickly (as did the Lexapro and buspar). We upped it to 50 and I was even more miserable. I couldn’t take it so I quit cold turkey (I know you’re not supposed to do that but I was desperate to get it out of my system).

My OBGYN recommended Wellbutrin when she did a quick mental health screening during my annual, and asked that I ask my psychiatrist about it. He was very hesitant to start me on it because of the potential risk of causing seizures. He also didn’t want to try any other medication within the same category of the ones I’ve already taken, as it’s likely that they would yield the same abysmal results and he didn’t want me to have to do trial and error for another six months.

So, I’ve come to Reddit to ask if there is anyone who might have been/is currently in my situation who could give me any advice or recommendations? I miss how normal I felt on Lexapro, I thought I could deal with not being on any meds but it’s proven difficult. Any suggestions would be helpful. The next time I see my neurologist I plan to ask her if she has any recommendations as well.",1
"I have been taking medication for my mental illness for roughly three years. I started off with a diagnosis of Depression.. then was later diagnosed with Bipolar. Started Buspar and Depakote. Buspar was shitty for me, Depakote was great until it wasn’t. Bounced to some sleeping medicine, lamictal, vistaril, Vraylar.. and the list continues. After starting Buspar and Depakote months later I’m referred to a psychologist who diagnosis me with.. bipolar, BPD, anxiety, ADHD, some traits of schizophrenia but doesn’t believe I have it. And etc. The doctor also looked at me and told me that if I was still self harming people would think I was crazy and that I would go away to the hospital. Months and months later.. I get wasted and got into huge fight with my mom who tries to take me to the hospital and I run away and didn’t come back until she swore she wouldn’t take me. Great times! Then I get referred to a psychiatrist. He starts me back on vistaril and lamictal. And also prescribed adderall and Luvox. I feel the medicine I’m on now help. But it’s just the simple fact of struggling to take them everyday. Does anyone else have this problems and what do they do to ensure they take there medicine. I’ve tried a pill planner, alarms and people calling me to wake me up to take my meds. It fails. Which it is most definitely my option to listen to all these but sometimes I just wish I didn’t need the meds anymore.. but I know how that will go. Even on the meds somedays I want to SH, or down a whole bottle. I’ve also considered abusing my meds.. but there’s a piece of me that knows better. But I get tired of hearing “it’s one day at a time”, or “you have to look at life at a different perspective”. Life is shitty and sucks. Yeah there’s good but damn.. why does there have to be so much bad for so little good. ",1
"Just a warning, this maybe a bit disorganized and or have poor grammar at times. 

Hello everyone, I'm at a bit of a bad place right now and I've been looking for information / support / acknowledgement that this exists from strangers. I don't really know what good it will do me, but I hope by getting myself out there it can help my mental health a bit.

Bit of a back story. I'm 36 now and I've had anxiety all my life. It started when I was 9 and I chocked on a tortilla from taco johns. From there I remember infrequent times where I was hungry I would shake uncontrollably. I didnt always have the best food options growing up but I learned to live with it. As an adult I would have panic attacks if I went to long without eating. The symptoms were essentially copy and pasted what hypoglycemia would look like. However my blood sugar during these times was fine.

I've been on lexapro for about a decade now and my anxiety was under control with the trigger listed above as the only thing I had to actively manage. With needing to eat to avoid panic attacks, you can imagine it was hard to control my weight.

Cue last september, I had a burning sensation when taking a pee. Turns out I was passing sugar in my urine. It's type 2 diabetes time! I immediately took control the best I could with dietary changes. I lost about 25 lbs in a few months on my own adding victoza about 6 weeks after my diagnosis. I had wanted ozempic as many of my friends were on it. I was also scared of metformin because of its rare interaction with alcohol. 

Late january we had a shortage of victoza here. At the same time I conveniently got a letter in the mail that my insurance would now cover ozempic. I had been stable and doing quite well. My weight had plateaued but my blood sugar was under control. Now it's time to restart the process but hopefully lose more weight! Around 2/23 I started my first dose of ozempic. 

April 10th was my first episode. officially I was diagnosed with fainting. I was sleeping in bed and I woke up and something felt off. I was overwhelmed with panic and rushed out and immediately fainted. I went to the ER and after a battery of tests nothing was found to be wrong with me. 

May 1st it happened again. This time my primary started my on buspar to help with the anxiety. I had high hopes that this was just my anxiety and this would fix it. It lasted all of 2 weeks.

May 15th was just a few days ago now. I've had some normal and some not so normal days between my last 2 dr visits but something broke for me this morning. I was looking at something and had a feeling of nostalgia and it triggered a panic attack. I was stuck in that moment and everything I did to look forwards felt hopeless. I woke my wife and tried to have her help calm me down. After talking to her I was feeling numb and felt like doing things to feel again. I wanted to hit the walls, bite myself, or anything to feel real. Thats when I decided to go in again, these thoughts were not my own. 

In the ER they have me ativan which calmed me down. I made an appointment with my primary and saw her that afternoon. We agreed to stop the buspar and the ozempic as well. We feel as if the ozempic nausea is triggering my anxiety and the buspar seems to have exasperated it rather than help. It's been 8 days since my last shot of ozempic. I'm taking hydroxyzine for the anxiety episodes. It helps but makes me sleepy. Last night I had nightmares and when I woke up i couldnt stay awake long enough to get away from them due to the sedative effect. I think I'll try and ride out the day without them. 

For now I'm trying to take it a minute at a time, an hour at a time, a day at a time. Each time I have a slight bit of nausea its sugar coated with anxiety. We are hoping that once the ozempic leaves my body ill return to how I was before and able to manage my anxiety.  

  
If youve made it this far thanks for reading. There is no tldr if you skipped to get here. ",1
"I have genuinely attempted to receive help in my area and surrounding areas. I have done everything from every damn 1st line pill to taking benzos daily for months, the only thing that workd was benzos but we know those aren't prescribed long term and they are dangerous blahblahblah. I think me jumping off a building or swerving my car into a bridge is a little more dangerous but okay doc. 

I recently did Transcranial magnetic stimulation as a last ditch attempt to relieve some of my anxiety. It did nothing. More money flushed.

I have gotten on and off every standard pill people blab about. Trintellix, Rameron, LExapro, Zoloft, Prozac, Seroquel, Wellbutrin, Buspar, Effexor, Pristiq, Paxil, and more.

These serotogenic  type drugs only make me apathetic, chronically exhausted and dead inside. Not to mention weight gain and sexual dysfunction. There is no joy or relief of anxiety. I have taken Xanax, Klonopin with great success but those are never given more than a couple weeks due to addiction potential or whatever.

I just feel like the only things that work aren't available and anything that might help I've tried and have yet to get relief.

&#x200B;

Some would be very blessed to be in my position. I have a good job, good savings, nice car, nice house, beautiful fiancee who loves and cares about me but I am so stressed out, anxious and high key that I can't even go meet my fiancee's parents for breakfast. Then the stress of them wondering why, us having to always make an excuse makes me want to just off myself to save myself the shame and embarrassment. 

I sometimes just feel like I can't receive successful treatment and maybe I need to end myself so my fiancee and family can find someone who is less miserable and who can actually enjoy the things they have. I am just tired of trying to fight to survive and waking up miserable, irritated, panicky, shaky, rough..

For many years I was able to fight these thoughts but the last couple weeks the stress of upcoming marriage, lack of treatment options, has me really just not wanting to suffer anymore. I flew home 12 hours in a panic where I was passing in and out of consciousness and sweating so bad the flight attendant thought I spilled something on my clothes. My psych told me to take benadryl for the anxiety. I just feel like a fucking joke and am tired of suffering. 

&#x200B;

I have tried psychadelic retreats as well, then I even did 2 years completely substance free even cutting out caffeine and still felt miserable like this. My anxiety chokes me out, makes me feel like I am going to die any second, keeps me awake for days at a time, I just cant see myself pushing through this much longer anymore. I dream of dying. 

If I refuse to go inpatient somewhere, what are my options? Is there some new therapy or pill that I'm not aware of? I refuse to go back to standard talk therapy or CBT, it didn't work at all and only worsened me after 4 years of trying going sometimes once a week.",1
"Firstly, I want to apologize if this is going to be long and thank the ones who decided to take the time to red this.

I have to start at the beginning, I guess, so whomever decides to read this can understand what I'm asking/confirming whatever I gain the confidence and courage to type. Also, I'll try to keep this as short as possible without leaving major details out.

At the moment, I am at the age of 32 years, and I undenify as a male. When I was younger, when I was in elementary school, my mother decided to leave me and my younger brother while she went to the store real quick. She never came back. My father at the time was always away working in construction at some high-profile places (celebrities houses, big company sites ect ect). So he was gone 2 states away and wasn't due back for another week. We were found 3 days later when my grandparents hadn't heard anything from my mother. She went missing, and no one could find her, and she disappeared. Fast forward a few months, and she called my grandparents(her parents) and told them that she was in Mexico and wanted to come home. 

I was always taught that the man had to be big and strong and show no emotions or weakness at all, and I learned during all that time to bottle it all down and be strong. My grandfather's at the time were my father figures during that time because my mother was passing me and my brother off to them while she would go out and get high on whatever drugs she could get her hands on. Also, again, my father was away working to provide for me and my brother. It took me just a few years ago when I had my first major mental breakdown to realize that and understand it, or so I, myself, understand it.

My mother and father divorced, and we moved with my mother to many different places over the next couple of years, different states on the East Coast. Then eventually close enough to both of the grandparents. She found a  an abusive boyfriend and he decided to move in. I was in middle school going into high-school when she left me and my brother again, and disappeared again. Luckily I was old enough to realize what happened and called the grandparents to get us.

A couple of years went by, and my brother and I were living with my father. He still worked construction, but it was always closer to home now. I remember this day very vividly and it replays in my head quite often. I was in junior year of high school, English class when the teachers phone rings and he called me to come to the phone. It was my mother and she simply told me hi and that she wished me a happy birthday and hung up. I went to my desk and put my head down and truly cried and broke down at my desk. There was no way to find out where she called from or how she was able to get the number to the classroom at that time. 

Friends came and went, and the same went with the couple of girlfriends and one cheating on me for a really good friend at the time. After graduating high school, I decided to move up north with my father and work at my uncles company. My mother shows back up and says that she is a new person and a couple years go by and I decided to move back south where I eventually I met my now loving wife. We decided to get married after being together for two years. 

Fast forward 6 years later my one grandfather passed away while i was at the hospital bed and after that time is when I started having some disturbing thoughts and told my wife I didn't want to be with her anymore so she or so I thought in my head at that time would have to see what I was going through or that I had suicidal thoughts. I perfected the perfect mask at this point and told her it was because I didn't love her anymore and was cold to her but never put my hands on her as she rightfully threw stuff at me. 

6 months goes by and I have a reality check after one really bad drunk weekend. I never once touched drugs other than weed a couple of times because if I have to be honest, my mother scared the living shit out of me watching her do drugs and drink. I called my wife after I sobered up and apologized and really told her what was going on. During this time I started having really bad anxiety. I moved in with my wife and we honestly work on things and it honestly made our relationship stronger and stronger because I learned how to talk to her. I went to doctors because the anxiety was getting bad and was always what I would call it analyze mode where I would aways look around the room and see where everything is placed and different places I could leave the room and still do that to this day. He told me that I had anxiety and depression.

During the next couple of years I went through every depression and anxiety medication you can think of and if you would look in my closet, it looks like a pharmacy in there from all of them. I'm on paxil ( I think that it's spelled because by the time I reached here it is 6am and I started at 11pm last night.) and Buspar. There's some days that I feel great and then there's some days I just want to disappear and go live in the mountains some where and have the plans done all up and hidden if it ever came to that day. I do have the often suicidal thoughts but let me say this and make this clear I WILL NOT GO THROUGH WITH IT EVER. I made a promise to my wife that I would never do it. And she knows I have them because I tell her just about everything except for where those plans are.

My mother moved close to us.

We move in with grandmother to help her out 

Mother moves closer and is nearby all the time because of the grandmother drinks and so does my mother.

My anxiety gets way worse to where me and the wife have come to the conclusion I'm audio hallucinations where I think the dog is barking or doors slamming or someone saying my name. Nothing bad in the since but it has been becoming a very frequent thing. And I also have been seeing shadows just inside my sight range. 

The doctor told me I should go see a psychologicalist or whatever and I want to but I'm afraid. Not for the simple fact that I have to tell them this stuff but what their reaction to what is going on in my head. I don't want tobe put in some mental hospital or anything because of my thoughts that I have. 

But I do want to get better and enjoy my life with my wife but my head won't quiet down anymore.( AGAIN I WILL NOT GO THROUGH WITH THOSE THOUGHTS. ) I think of every thing that happens at any giving moment and I deal with it all day and night. I other think things, simple thing and sometimes I can think on it for days. I have recently noticed that I go in auto pilot mode for a few minutes and I don't remember what happens during that time. I hardly sleep now because of the medication because I love my sleep and miss my sleep soooooo very much. To be honest I hate people in general until I get to know someone then I become like them like I match up with what they like and pay attention to it to everything and watch this psychical movements. Not like any weirdo stuff or anything it's more to make sure they stay happy  and have fun around me.

I guess to end it all I guess I'm scared I want to seek help but scared of being trapped I guess you can say. I worried about everything and don't want to put my wife through that I really don't but I'm at the point I need to do something. I just need that courage push or whatever you make to get there but I always find a way to stop myself.

Am I honestly going crazy..? Is there something really wrong with me? And how do I stop finding ways to stop myself from making that next step for help?

Thank you for whomever decides to read this rant or whatever you call it anymore. I'm sorry that it was so long but this is the first time I've let it all out even though it's extremely cut down

Thank you again and hopefully I get some sleep because my head has finally calmed down enough from smoking weed to  maybe accomplish a couple hours of sleep

Good night all and I will check this often.",1
"I KNOW THIS IS LONG BUT PLEASE READ IF YOU HAVE INSIGHT ON SLEEP ISSUES, PSYCH MEDS, AND MENTAL HEALTH/NEURODIVERGENCE 

Context:
I have ADHD, OCD, anxiety/depression, c-ptsd, and autism. Because of this, falling asleep and going back to sleep is hard because of racing thoughts, sensory issues, etc. 

I have been on 20+ psych meds, a lot of which have made issues worse for me. Some of ""masked"" my sleep issues which makes it harder to sleep off them, and some caused vivid/excessive dreaming. (more on this later*) This is what really started to fuel my sleep anxiety/fear. The only constant on that I've been on is Adderall (a few months ago I switched from IR to XR for my afternoon “booster”) 

More recently: 
A few weeks ago, I went off of Zyprexa (I have been on it and other similar drugs before but keep going off bc horrible side effects, but then start again bc I can’t fall asleep), quit THC completely, and started Buspar (3x daily). My life has been hell ever since. 

Over the past few weeks, my nights have looked like this: I have a ton of trouble falling asleep, but do eventually. Anywhere from a few minutes to an hour later, I’ll wake up. Then  I’ll like, kinda be asleep but feel awake and am having racing thoughts and anxiety in general the whole time. I start waking up over and over every few minutes and falling back “asleep” into this state until eventually I’m too anxious and I’m wide awake. 

I’ll often take a Xanax/Ativan (been prescribed them “as needed” for about a month and a half now) after and sometimes it helps, but it’s becoming less effective; I’m still anxious, and by the time I take it I’ve already suffered and still only get a few hours of sleep. I’ve taken them before bed and again sometimes it helps, but it’s not a good daily option, but my “as needed” keeps getting more frequent thought

I’ve tried OTC sleep meds but they haven’t worked for more than one night. So, about a week ago I started Hydroxyzine, and it makes me physically tired at first, but I still have the same problems as mentioned above. My body is doing everything in it’s power for me not to sleep. Since starting Hydroxyzine, my dreams have 100x longer/more vivid/more realistic too. 

*More on the dreams: These dreams felt/feel like they happen in real time and I’m not actually sleeping because of how vivid they are. I remember every single thing about them, just like they’re movies. They’re triggering, distressing, and exhausting. I wake up from them too. 

I’ve been doing all of the recommended “sleep hygiene” things (warm bath, listening to podcast/meditation, no social media before bed, etc.) but nothing seems to help. My brain is too loud and too powerful. My therapist feels hopeless/stuck, my psychiatrist feels hopeless/stuck, and I feel hopeless/stuck. 

I’m stuck in a cycle where I’m so anxious about sleeping that my body won’t sleep, not matter how tired it is, which just makes me more anxious. Every night is torture and it gets harder and harder to sleep every night.

I’m looking for any advice that could help me. I don’t know what to do and I’m so tired. I just want to be knocked out.",1
"I feel so detached from life. I’m taking lyrica for anxiety and atomextine (strattera) for adhd , it’s the only mediations I’ve ever tolerated. I’m currently sitting with GAD, ADHD, BPD and 10+ doctors still aren’t sure if I’ve got bipolar or not. I’ve gone through a lot of stress the past few years, but medication wise I thought I was on the right path, but I’m miserable, my anxiety was at bay for a while. I wake up so tired, and foggy, no matter how much I sleep and for the whole day man, like it’s 2pm and all i can muster is wanting to be in bed curled up. I feel like I can’t organize my thoughts and do what i want, tasks i feel require so much energy that I just do not have. I’m sad all the time, frustrated by my situation and not being able to do anything. My anxiety is just through the roof. I’m now stuttering at work trying to talk to people, like my brain can’t spit the words out (talking to family or friends this doesn’t happen), or not being able to properly describe a product to someone at work, despite knowing exactly what I’m talking about. I can’t focus on anything in the moment, especially texting people back, it’s like a huge chore. I’m having literal temper tantrums sometimes and it just feels like I get so angry and have outbursts I can’t control. I barely feel like a person and I just am at such a loss. My doctor prescribed me buspirone (Buspar) but it’s not covered by my insurance and I really don’t want to pay $85 for pills that’ll end up making me worse. Trying to add on 5-HTP to maybe subside some of the depressive and anxiety symptoms. No one will prescribe me a stimulating adhd med bc no one knows if I have bipolar or not 🥲 feels like you’ve gotta go crazy or die for anyone to do anything. I’m definitely missing things but I’m in such a dark place and no doctors can help right now idk what to do :/ I’m not in like a crisis but shit man this sucks so bad",1
"So, I’ve been on buspar and paxil for a while. Along with clonidine and Lamictal. Basically, your girl is a mess. 

I’ve had to see multiple doctors recently regarding some physical health issues. And several of them have questioned the buspar, and paxil together and tell me it’s a bad idea. That is can cause serotonin syndrome and serious heart problems. 
But I’ve been on them for years with more than one psych NP, and a psychiatrist as well, and no one has ever batted an eyelash. No pharmacist has ever questioned it either. 
I’ve never had high blood pressure or anything suggesting a heart issue.
But I panicked and tried to get off the paxil. My doctor was a little surprised as to why, and I just tried to shrug it off. Say it was because of dry eyes and headaches, which turns out are unrelated.
And now, I’m an absolute mess. My anxiety and panic are a nightmare. I cry constantly.

TL;DR: Buspar and Paxil has worked well for me for years, but several regular (non-psych) doctors have raised concerns about the interactions. Tried to get off of paxil and now I’m a mess.

What should I do here? I don’t know who’s right or wrong or what",1
"Mostly venting- but feedback would help

I’ve experienced GAD for about a decade now. Ive been on Buspar for a number of years, and while it helps with the daily anxiety of being a person, it doesn’t help with things like having to take the subway, or the dentist, so i use Ativan as needed. Due to how stupid our health care system is i had to start with a new office/set of providers. I loved the first doctor i was placed with he had no issue with how i was medicated and no problem filling my scripts. after about 3 visits with him i  got a call the he had resigned and i would be placed with a different doctor within the office. Bummer but these things happen.    
Doctor #2  immediately had issue with my treatment plan and said i should be on an SSRI and no Ativan. I explained that i use it very infrequently, sometimes going months with out needing any, but she was not hearing this and said i should try Prozac. I’ve been very resistant to SSRi’s since an old GP prescribed me Paxil and the first dose sent me to the hospital. I had to convince her to start me on a lower dose the normal, but i was willing to try cause maybe it could make my life better.  
I took 10 Mg of Prozac for a month and had a horrible tremor, shaky legs, no appetite and feeling like i was communicating badly with everyone around me. The feed back from friends was that “i was upsettingly calm”. At my follow up appointment the doc said this wasn’t good and that i should try something else. She prescribed Pristiq and said to stop Prozac that day and start Pristiq tomorrow. This sounded wild to me considering the side effects i was having. 15 minutes into my 30 minute telemedicine visit she said she needed to cut my appointment short because she had to go to the bathroom. Not that an emergency had come up. Something about the way she was prescribing and cutting my appointment short really rubbed me the wrong way and i asked to see someone else.  
I was now on to my 3rd doctor at the same place. This new one also did not like my Buspar /Ativan as needed method and we should try some other SSRI’s at low dose. Again, i knew that this kind of thing is trial and error, and maybe it could make my life better so we tried Zoloft. I broke a 25mg tablet in half for a month and i still had a tremor, stomach issues, very jittery, and got lots of feed back that i was kind of being a bitch at work.   
We moved on to Lexapro-5mg. My coordination s was so off. I would run into things i had just been looking at. I fell down the last few stairs of flight of stairs because i was so dizzy.  
Abilify 5mg- everything smells rotten and food sucks. Vomiting, restlessness, uncomfortable, could not stay in a chair. I spent a lot of money on things like lotto scratchers.   
Effexor 37.5 mg- This one was the worst. I would start getting the “rushes” around 4am and would have to get up and do something. So no sleep, increased anxiety, spending hours at the gym and going on long walks to burn off energy. I lasted 8 days on it.  
The doctor seems to finally be coming around to the fact that i am a very sensitive flower and that these meds don’t really work for me. We are upping the buspar but she it still being very strict about my ativan use (which increased greatly during the abilify/effoxor switch.   
Im off effexor for 10 days now. Still not sleeping well, but my anxiety does seem to be getting better. I feel like over all shit, but it does seem to be getting better.   
TL:DR  
Ive been on 5 different Psych meds in the last 6-7 months, all with horrendous effects  
Should I see my GP for blood work? I don’t even know what to look for, but maybe something else is up?  
Is this normal for trying to figure out anxiety?   
Should I be looking for a new center/ doctor?",1
"I’ve been struggling with anxiety and nervousness since I was in about 7th grade. I coped with it throughout high school and college, but once I was in my 20s and working full time I knew I had to get on medication to calm my brain. I’m 33 now, and feel like I’m just at a cross roads of figuring out who I am. I’ve been on and off many meds working with my doctors and now currently on Lexapro, Wellbutrin and Buspar. I had been taking Qelbree since being diagnosed with ADHD in the fall of 2022. However I decided to stop the Qelbree as I was just feeling very tired throughout the day, and didn’t want to feel like I was being over-medicated. 
 
I wouldn’t say I’m the classic example of ADHD, I.e. not being able to sit in school, hard time listening to the teacher or following rules, etc….mine is more on the Inattentive side where my reading comprehension was always poor, and was never fully able to digest information people say to me in a conversation. And even to this day when I get asked to do something adhoc from my boss I’ll panic but then want to get it done as fast as possible to get it off my plate. I’ll review it and make sure it’s accurate but never go above and beyond. 

I am married, and have a nice house but still feel like I’m not deserving of it, and I would say my self esteem is slightly low. I guess I sort of have the imposture syndrome, especially with starting a new job last year. I feel unmotivated and lazy from time to time. No real depression where I can’t get out of bed, but the blues from time to time. 

I’ve always had racing thoughts with some OCD (counting, cleanliness) and intrusive thoughts with an addictive personality - watching porn, using nicotine, marijuana use over the years to relieve stress or make me feel euphoric to escape my fears. And then of course my mind recognizes that these things are okay in moderation and I’d try to quit them forever and then relapse down the road. 

Any tips for coping with intrusive and racing thoughts (like being unable to settle down and relax because you FEEL like you have to get something done whether it be errands, work, chores around the house)? I guess I could try to exercise more but is there any tips or techniques that help to trick your brain into not giving in to those intrusive and unwanted thoughts? 

I know this is a lot but I wanted to explain my entire situation because it’s been bugging me for a long time, and my therapist hasn’t really been able to help me besides doing breathing exercises and writing down words of affirmation for myself. 

Thanks!",1
about two weeks ago someone gave me wax coated marijuana and i started hallucinating and freaked out during it. only Monday of this week did i start dissociating and getting flashbacks to the really scary high and i tried to tell my mom about how it's really scary and she just keeps on laughing at me. my therapist gave me buspar but it only somewhat helps. can someone please tell me how to stop the flashbacks and dissociation? it's almost constant and i want to feel real not like I'm in a dream and i can't go to school and ride on the bus without getting flashbacks. i know i sound overdramatic but I'm being totally serious. that pot fucked me up and I'm scared and i just want the dissociation to stop. my therapist said that it's common and that she has seen adolescents go full on psychotic over just one trip on pot so i know I'm not alone.,1
"i’ve tried adarax, adavan, and i was unaware but I’ve tried buspar. Right now they’re shooting for visteril 5mg three times a day. I am schizo affective so I hear and see hallucinations. I’m in such mental pain everyday and sometimes in the evening it gets even worse. I’m lucky if it starts during the night because I’d soon be going to bed. When they ask “is it mental or physical pain?“ I obviously say mental but I feel like they‘re referring to depression which I don’t have. Sometimes I can’t even describe my problem becoming very vague only being able to call it anxiety because I don’t know what else it would be. but feeling like this really hurts and I almost cannot tolerate everyday life",1
"  I've been holding back sobbing all day at this one sentence. I haven't had the most fortunate life. I grew up in the lower class, with just enough money to eat and pay bills (barely) and that's it. My parents love me but both suffered horrible childhood abuse so they don't always show their love in the best ways.   
  My mom suffers from Anxiety and PTSD  
  My dad is an insufferable narcissist and chronic cheater.

   I won't get too much into it but my dad was physically and mentally abusive my entire childhood; On the other hand, my mom was kind of absent... She was home; but holed up in her room or garage, dismissing me and my siblings when we tried to talk to her which created this invisible wall between her and me and my sister.   


  The worst of the abuse from my dad started in middle school which is when I started >!self-harming and attempting suicide.!< On top of the constant bullshittery from my dad, my sister (older by 1 yr) handled the abuse by doubling down on me. Ripping my hair out, beating me, telling me to off myself, etc. We shared a room that provided me with no safe space to decompress other than the bathroom, and even that was hard to get away with, with another young girl in the house.   
 

 Since 7th grade, I was baker-acted 4 times, all self-admitted. I was horrified by my own thoughts. Every small mistake, even just dropping something; my thoughts immediately turned to thoughts of >!self-harm and suicide.!< When my parents found out I was >!self-harming!< the first thing out of my dad's mouth was, ""now I have to pay for therapy for my fucked up daughter"".  


  My thoughts hearing that went to a very obvious place. This was my first attempt. I was 13.  
  I talked to my school counselor and asked to be baker-acted. I was placed under psychiatric hold for 72 hours; given 3 different meds, (Zoloft, Buspar, and another one I can't remember,) and given a therapist.   
 

 Following my first attempt, I was in an extremely physically and emotionally abusive relationship,  ( I was 14, he was 18). All my peers watched as I got abused at school, schoolwork broken/ripped up, and physically hurt by said boyfriend in front of teachers. I felt helpless. The relationship lasted about 9 months and still affects me to this day. During this relationship, I tried to leave 3 times and I was met with sh/sc threats which for me, ( a literal child) I was horrified of his words becoming a reality. He taught me how to harm myself more severely and pretended to commit it several times attempting to get pity from me. He also is the main source of my SA trauma. During this relationship, I was baker-acted 2 more times for attempting.  


  My home life had only gotten worse as over the years I watched my dad have 2 heart attacks and a stroke right in front of me. I finally left my abusive relationship, commit again, got admitted, and got released. I worked a few jobs. dropped out of high school, went back, worked more jobs, dated more horrible people, got abused, sh'd. The cycle never failed to repeat.   


  This year I finally graduated high school online, (two years late); but, my physical and mental health deteriorated to where I can't work physical labor or standing jobs without fainting and getting sick which has glued me to my computer for the past year. (  Now you're probably thinking, ""wow this girl just can't catch a break"". Believe me, I know LMFAO)   


  Where I live not a lot of doctors take my insurance so taking care of my physical health has been nothing less than a challenge; I was, however, able to find a good mental health/therapy center.   
I've been put on new meds and assigned a therapist and the meds have been working wonders.   


(""Wow this girl sure talks a lot! when are we going to get to the part about her being happy like in the title???"" Patients duckling, here is your bread.)   


Now that you have about 60% of my trauma and background, (Believe me it gets even worse I'm just really tired of typing LMFAO). let's get to the happy part.  


  Today I got to see my cousin and her mom for the first time since I was a kid. My family went to lunch with them to hang out and catch up. I was anxious but it was worth it and I feel like I finally bonded with a family member my age for once.

   After lunch, they left and my nephew, (yes he is older than me, my dad has had 3 marriages) brought over his kids to come to play with my little brother while he tried to fix my car. I had fun watching them and playing with them and spending time with my nephew, who even though he is 20 years older than me, still treats me as his equal and is one of the closest familial bonds I have.  


  Today was the calmest, most ""normal"" day I've ever had. The day, as calm and fun as it was, on top of my meds that have been tremendously helping my thoughts and stability, Has genuinely made me happy; something I never realized I hadn't experienced until today; which in turn made me immediately start bawling the second I sat down and really let myself process.   


  I'm terrified that ill never feel that feeling again, but I am also acutely aware that the fact that I was able to feel that at all is a huge tell that I am heading in the right direction for my recovery and that it can only go up from here. I am looking forward to getting better as I continue therapy and my medication management, and I want to thank anyone who reads this for opening your mind to my experience and even giving advice if you do.  Thank you for reading <3",1
"I’m so fucking anxious, I leave for college tomorrow, it’s my second year. My first year first semester I had an extreme manic episode and ended up going to an inpatient. Second semester I got sexually assaulted. This semester I’m going to my school to file a restraining order on campus bc ik they won’t get kicked out. I’m so anxious bc I have to deal with this I’m scared of having another manic episode bc they always come in august. At least for the past two years. My mania is caused by anxiety and my bpd. I’ve been getting less than 5 hrs of sleep every night bc I’m in a constant state of anxiety. I’ve been forgetting to eat food I apologize in every sentence, when ppl don’t respond I start sobbing bc I feel like I’ve been annoying the. I’m just peaked all the fucking time. I can’t sleep until I pass out at 5 am every night for two weeks. My psych doesn’t think it’s a mania build up bc I’m medicated but I’m not fully medicated. I don’t think it is either bc the only manic symptoms I have is no sleep talking extremely fast and no eating, is my ego big rn? No clue it might be but idk. But these are symptoms of anxiety thought but I’ve never felt this type of anxiety. Im not scared that my normal anxiety im not paranoid im just so so so anxious. I can’t go on anxiety meds bc im bipolar and can’t go on SSRIs and I had a severe allergic reaction BuSpar so there isnt much left for me to have. My meds are suppose to help my anxiety but it hasn’t. My psych said going up will help but it hasn’t, when I went to his office I was an anxious mess but he said once I settle down in college I should be fine but I’ve been like this for like two weeks now. I really think I should go up bc of how bad my anxiety is (im on lamictal as a mood stabilizer) I take hydroxyzine but that just helps with panic attacks and sleep. Not anxiety bc it just puts me to sleep. I can’t use it to sleep though when I have to do something important im the morning bc I wake up hung over, headache sluggish blah blah blah. Im so anxious I don’t want to see the ppl that bullied me in college I don’t want to see my assaulters I just want to do my school work and see my friends but I have to see my assaulter everyday bc we are in all the same classes bc we are in the same major and the major works closely together. The head of my department knows all of this bc I told him and he said he would do everything he can to make sure im comfortable. 

I just don’t want something bad to happen every month something bad happens to me it’s easy when im at home and it bad but when im at college it’s hard. I don’t have a therapist when I go back bc she hasn’t been in practice long enough to go across state boarder. So I don’t have her and she’s been keeping me in check. I plan on driving to the state boarder and doing telehealth bc that’s the only legal way to do it and I know I’ll need the help when I first get there.

I just need to sleep but my brain won’t shut off nor will my body. I think im going to try and tire myself out with exercise. I hope this is mania build up I don’t think it is it doesn’t feel like it but I have no clue th only time my anxiety feels like this is when im manic but im not manic according to my doctor but it could be getting there bc my anxiety is a trigger for it. And the only time I have to workout to tire myself is when im manic but Im not manic im just so fucking anxious im freaking the fuck out and I don’t even know what to say anymore bc im just so so so anxious",1
"How do I(25F) communicate with my partner(29M) that I feel like I’m finally making progress on my mental health, but the lack of care in his mental health makes me feel like it holds back my progress without triggering him and/or setting me back?

I feel like this is extremely dangerous territory I’m stepping in. I feel guilty just typing my thread title out. I don’t even know how to word it without sounding accusatory. I would like to preface that I love my partner so much. And that I don’t think that my problems and mental health are more important/worse than his or vice versa. 

We’ve been dating since October of 2017 and we both knew were coming out of messed up relationships. I was living in 1998 Southwind RV with no running water/electricity after a nasty split with my ex and ex-roommates. He had just moved back in with his parents after an aggressive break up. We took a chance on each other, fell deeply in love despite our traumas, depression, and anxiety, and a year later we saved up enough money to rent an apartment together. 

The last two years of our relationship we learned to live together. We work as a team. We hardly ever have financial arguments even when we are both poor and struggling. We’re really good at being mindful of our actions and words towards each other. We are both aware of our mental health. We have incredible thought provoking and healthy conversations. 

We both have inner demons we face. We share most of our problems, and the ones we have a hard time sharing, we help each other find the right words so that way one day we can share what we are going through in a healthy way. To be honest, we’ve both admitted to having depression and anxiety. But sometimes our conversations make me feel inferior since I was clinically diagnosed and he is self diagnosed. 

I participated in intensive behavioral therapy programs and have been prescribed paraxotene and buspar back in 2015. But I have not been in treatment or under any medication the entire duration of my current relationship. I’m starting to think that I should seek help again. I’ve had a few major break downs here and there but for the most part, especially now I feel like I’ve made incredible progress with my self awareness, mental health, and even conflict resolution. Even with how confident I feel, I have the urge to seek therapy and just clean my brain? Like going to the dentist almost. I certainly don’t want to relapse back into my toxic state of hurting myself and the people around me since from my experience, it could happen any moment if I’m not consistently conscience of my mental health. 

My partner on the other hand... I look back on our three years together and the his personal progress on his life goals, short term goals, mental health goals, etc. all of it seems to fall short of his expectations. From our conversations and even from our arguments sometimes, he will openly admit he’s not where he wants to be in life. He has the perfect girlfriend and life partner. But his career lack. His personal relationships with his friends and family lack. He’s unhappy with his body image. He knows he drinks to much, but doesn’t stop drinking. He says he’s got depression and anxiety but does not seek treatment or coping resources. He’s “not where I want to be in life, I have the perfect life partner, just not the perfect life setting.” 

We have this awesome relationship dynamic and I’m so glad that with his help, he’s jumpstarted me to care for myself and respect myself more and I do all those things and see he does the exact opposite for himself? And I know it’s hard to take your own advice and sometimes it can be easier said than done... but I never did any of those things for myself because he wanted me to. I did it because he helped me realize and want it for myself. 

Now I have this new job I’ve been at for a year that I love with good pay. New friends and awesome co workers. Picked up some old hobbies again and even learned some new ones. I’m reconnecting with neglected relationships and I feel like I’m just really blossoming again... 

I just want all those things he wanted for himself and all the things I have right now for him as well. It’s hard to enjoy all the progress I’ve made in my life with someone who can’t enjoy it with me. He tells me how envious he can be of me breaking my social anxiety and connect with all my friends. He tells me how he can see that I have all these interests and hobbies and he sits on his phone and naps whenever he can. I can see that he struggles to take care of himself when I’m not around. 

I feel like an enabler for not encouraging him to take care of himself or seek help. I’ve been digging myself out of this hole we both were in. He gave me a little boost to get up out of the hole, and when I turn to extend my hand to help him out of the hole too, he chooses to stay in it? I don’t know what to do or how to approach him about his mental health without starting a major argument. I don’t want him to make me feel like I’M the one with the REAL problems and not him and use that as an excuse to focus on getting me help instead of him.

I personally have noticed this pattern with myself where if there’s a problem in any situation involving myself, and it turns out that the problem ended up being me, or I end up convincing myself that the problem was me, I just “remove” myself from the situation, therefore, removing the problem. And I REALLY don’t want that to happen between us. 

I feel like if either of those things happen, it’ll set me back in all the progress I’ve made on my mental health the last three years and damage my relationship with my partner who I love dearly, even with trying to keep both our best interest at heart. 

How do I(25F) communicate with my partner(29M) that I feel like I’m finally making progress on my mental health, but the lack of care in his mental health makes me feel like it holds back my progress without triggering him and/or setting me back?",1
"Has any one with anxiety experienced being out of breath and gasping for air 24/7, even when their not anxious. 
If so how long did it last and how did you cure it",1
"Okay, so basically i’ve suffered through anxiety, and depression since I was around 14. But I smoked weed and ate some edibles that landed me in the emergency with my pulse being at 180. I thought I was having a heart attack. And I wanna say ever since then I haven’t been normal. My health anxiety has been at an all time worse. I’ve been to the cardiologist, said I was fine, I’ve been to the Neurologist, did a Mri of my head. Said everything was fine. But my anxiety has been worse. They upped my medications and i’m not sure if that’s what’s causing me to feel like this. I feel like i’m in a constant dream. I’m always Panicky, I’m starting to get bad thoughts, i’m scared  i’m turning schizophrenic or into a psychopath. I cant remember waking up. I feel like a walking zombie, I feel like my body just isn’t there. I feel like i’ve been in a coma for months and just can’t get out. Right now i’m taking 40 mg prozac, 10 mg Buspar and 1 mg klonopin, I wanna say ever since they raised my prozac i’ve been feeling like this but I’m not sure. I’m scared i’m never gonna be the same again. I’m scared of my brain. I’m scared it’s gonna get worse. Please just someone help me and tell me why i’m feeling like this. Please",1
"Information:

I'm male. I'm 31. I live alone. I have 1 or 2 trustworthy friends that I consider ""best"" friends.

I've been undergoing therapy, specifically EMDR to deal with traumatic memories for the past 9 months. I'm also going to go through orientation for a nearby hospital's outpatient treatment program in the next two weeks. I've been prescribed Seroquel and Buspar by my doctor to treat what he diagnosed as bipolar and anxiety.

I've had a history of self-harm through some cutting, but mainly bludgeoning myself or hitting myself until marks/bruises/bumps appear. My therapist is aware of this.

I have a history of intense emotional outbursts, such as crying and rage, especially when I'm attempting to get something right. This happens whenever I fail, or perceive that I have failed at something. I've dealt with thoughts of self-loathing/self-hatred and worthlessness, so this manifests itself fairly broadly. Practicing any of the instruments that I've played, writing, trying to remember the definition of a word, forgetting information about paying rent that a friend told me about previously, constantly losing in a video game, not being able to debug a coding example, not being able to solve a math problem, etc. Those are just some examples I can think of right now. I'm sure there have been other times where I've had the same reaction, I just can't think of them right now.

I've attempted to control these outbursts with my therapist by naming the property of myself that comes out at these times as ""madness"", and then imagining that I've put the part into a room where it's not necessarily restrained, but that it can't get to me or my other ""parts"" and that I could view it through a one-way mirror as an exercise to exert control over it. I also gave it a description, which resembles me in some way, but slightly taller with blackened muscle fibers wrapping it together without skin over the muscle, dripping a tar-like substance on the ground, and it was heavily breathing constantly. During the session it seemed like it had lessened in intensity, but it was staring at me. There is no skin on it, so it's just staring without really giving me a tell on what it's feeling or thinking as I'm trying to connect with it. This was all discussed during our session, and was instructed to check in with the ""madness"" on daily basis to try and connect with it to see why it's there, where it came from, and what I can do to get it to function properly as a part of myself.

I did this yesterday, but it seemed like that part of me was just shut down. Shut down as if you were to see some automaton in a deactivated state. No breath, no movement, eye-sockets seemingly empty.

I went about my day. I finished a simple programming problem regarding design patterns. I read some news. I sat down to play a game. I lost. I played again. I lost. I played again. I lost. I got enraged. I didn't react. I lost again. I didn't react. I lost again, and again, and again.

And then I started crying and screaming, while hitting myself. I kept saying, ""I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it,"" much in the manner that a small child would when they're failing at something difficult over and over again, or at least how I did as a child. I got on the phone with my therapist's voicemail and just kept hitting myself over and over. I still have headaches from the blows and marks on my face. She called back while I was on the phone with someone else, but left me a voicemail saying that she was taking her break over the weekend with her family, but that she would check in on me over the next few days. This makes sense right now; I'm not the only one that she treats and she needs time away from her job like anyone else does.

I'm looking at the ""madness"" part of me right now through the same window that I was before. It's still ""deactivated"". I can't get a read on it or connect with it right now.

I don't talk with my best friends about this because they have their own problems that they deal with, and the times that I've spoken with them about it they tend to downplay what I'm saying, more than likely because I'm not communicating it well enough, or because I am and I don't understand how common it is to deal with.

I haven't been able to find others that deal with this kind of anger and frustration in themselves that are also my age. Most are younger. I think this is good, because they're developing themselves before it affects larger parts of their lives.

I don't know how to manage this in myself. I don't often feel happy or joy. When I do get something right, it's usually accompanied by a feeling that whatever task or problem I'm facing that I solved is now solved and that's it. I still try every day to do what I need to do, but there aren't celebrations. I set up a bench and a rack in my garage to lift, and I do it when I'm supposed to, but it doesn't make me feel accomplished. It's just something that I'm doing because I said I would do it. I don't fully understand the feeling of ""reward"" when completing a task.

I hope this is the appropriate place to post this kind of long piece. Really the only thing that I can say to close is that I don't know what to do about the child in me that won't grow up, and I don't know how to feel accomplished. I do know that I'm at least curious to know if there is anyone else that is dealing with something similar and how they manage, or if they are able to do something that allows them to feel the sting of failure, but balance it with a feeling of reward and how they were able to feel that.",1
"Been working with the mentally ill for almost 5 years (now as a psych RN), working acute psych, detox, rehab, and adolescent. I came from medical nursing and, for the first few years, felt my understanding of mental illness growing. Lately, however, I've become more confused (and/or disillusioned) by the entire field. 

As for my confusion - In acute psych in particular, the lack of patient insight distresses me. I've watched documentaries, PSAs, etc. where seemingly ""normal"" people speak about their struggles with schizophrenia or bipolar. My patients almost exclusively show no insight into their condition or are in some type of denial. They seem to exist only in the present, with very little insight into their past or future. I've had professors, physicians, professional athletes whose mental illness now defines them. They are no longer able to function as they once did. Do they remember their past lives in detail? Are they terrified/confused by the drastic change in their life? They don't appear to be. What's going through the mind of a schizophrenic with mostly negative symptoms - staring into the ceiling day after day, saying nothing?

I'm mostly disillusioned by the pharmaceutical side of mental illness. Maybe it's just my current facility (or a few of the facility's physicians), but is it common to continually chase symptoms with new meds? I have many pt's on 10-20 meds, with new orders daily (e.g. seroquel tid, wellbutrin bid, xanax tid, cogentin, benadryl, buspar, vistaril prn, zyprexa prn, trazodone qhs.....plus medical - robaxin, neurontin, etc). Again, i'm an RN not an MD, but at some point, I start to wonder if there's any way for someone to be stable on this amount of meds.

Sorry this is kind of all over the place...having a hard time gathering my own thoughts and emotions lately and that might be part of why i'm having such a difficult time lately with this stuff. I have extreme empathy for my pt's and love working in mental health - i don't think i'll ever go back to medical nursing. At this rate, however, if i don't get a good grasp on whether what we're doing is the right thing (or at least leading towards the right thing), I may have to leave the field. Guess I'm hoping for someone to put it in a way that makes more sense to me. ",1
"hello. i’m not sure if this is the right place for this, and if it isnt please let me know & perhaps show a subreddit that is the right place. 

i am a 16 yr old who has been struggling with severe depression and anxiety since around the age of 10. i have been on antidepressants for as long as i can remember. i was on prozac for years with no noticeable changes after increasing my amount to as much as i could have. in 2016 i went to a PHP and they added buspar to the prozac and that seemed to be working well until it wasnt. i had a suicide attempt in june of 2017 and that hospital put me on lexapro. lexapro made me the worst person you could ever meet. i was put onto zoloft when we realized the lexapro was the cause of my sudden behavioral issues. at the start of 2019, we added buspar with my zoloft because i felt that buspar had worked the most for me at the time. as of now i am still on buspar & zoloft. 

i dont quite know how to describe my relationship with medications. i’ve always known these pills werent “cures” so i always assumed me still feeling so sad on these medications were normal. i struggle with the question of if my medications are working because i truly believe i have yet to find a medication that works, so i dont know what it feels like.

within the last few months i’ve pondered with the idea that maybe i have treatment resistant depression & i’d like to hear other peoples experiences. i am still severely depressed and live with constant suicidal ideations. is this what it feels like for a medication to work? do you still feel suicidal on meds? i have been in PHP 3 times and an inpatient ward once. i have had one suicide attempt that was treated & that my family knows about, but the amount of times i ive done things hoping to die and just ended up waking up the next day are too many to count. the its like every time i believe my medication is working, and maybe the do for a little but the thoughts always return stronger than before. 

im reaching out because i need to start advocating for myself and taking my treatment into my own hands. my psychiatrist is a WEIRD ASS dude and i have 0 trust in him despite being with him for years. i plan to talk to my mom about getting a new one. within the past week, i have been consumed to suicidal thoughts and at my lowest point every single night. someone please help me understand if this is how im meant to feel.",1
So my doctor prescribed me Buspar for my anxiety problems and I was just wondering. Is it weird that I’m scared of taking medication because I don’t want to mess with the chemicals in my head? ,1
"this is about my best friend/room mate, so specifics and personal details may be a bit lacking but I'm determined to help however I can lol.

he was on 150 mg effexor xr for ~2 years (75 mg for 6 months then 150 mg for 1.5 years I think). buspar in addition to the effexor for ~6 months initially, then stopped taking that for ~6 months and then reestablished a 1 mg 3x a day xanax prescription he'd had for years prior.

he's been prescribed a myriad of antidepressants and a few antipsychotics in childhood and none really had a significant effect.

after that long on that high a dose of effexor and finally seeking help due to its ineffectiveness (and perhaps it's tendency to worsen his anxiety), his doctor weaned him off the effexor by having him take 75 mg effexor xr + 10 mg prozac + 1 mg xanax 3x a day for 7 days. after 7 days she told him to take 20 mg prozac + 1 mg xanax 3x a day.

he and I aren't sure if it's the effexor withdrawal due to insufficient weaning time or negative reaction to the prozac, but he's noticed increased paranoia I guess you could call it. hearing car doors and noises that may or may not be real, but.

nevertheless instantly thinking the car door or various noises (dogs, muffled voices, car engines, etc) are right outside and that they're produced by intruders of some kind. he describes feeling overstimulated by movement/sounds etc (said recently while sitting outside on a peaceful but windy day that it made him nervous and all he saw was chaos his brain couldnt make sense of) and unusually suspicious.

he's had two anger outbursts (a recurrent issue for him when feeling threatened) but nothing TOO crazy or out of the ordinary.

he seems to me more dependent upon company for mood stabilization. if he's all alone at home while I'm at work he gets depressed, but within half an hour of me being home he perks up significantly.

just wanting feedback on what these feelings and issues that are new to him may be caused by. his next appointment is in a week and he plans to discuss them then but the quick weaning time makes me a little suspicious of this doctor. though it's not as if I'm qualified or anything, I feel like wellbutrin may be promising for him since I knew someone who felt awful paranoid effects on prozac who switched to wellbutrin and saw significant improvement.

any feedback, personal accounts, stuff to read etc is appreciated guys",1

"Ugh! I’ve been on it for 8 months, I’m on day 7 of no buspar. I feel all my side effects from it have intensified! I feel depression and never in my life have I ever dealt with it before buspar! I feel like I’m going crazy or I’ll lose control! The brain fog and memory loss is the worst for me!! I truly feel hopeless from this drug and I only tried it because I was told it’s mild and has no side effects! Jokes on me",1
"My doctor prescribed me buspar 5mg. She said I could cut it in half (I have fear of taking medication) 

I have the pill in half laying on my nightstand terrified to take it after reading about people's dizzy side effects. Sounds horrible and also a trigger for me because I have low blood pressure when standing or sitting up.

"Been taking it for a few days for generalized anxiety. But had a massive panic attack at walmart today and i havent had a bad panic attack like that in a while. Has anyone one else experienced this?

Should i push through? Im contemplating on stopping tonight. ",1
"I’m not on it right now, but I’m curious as to why most people aren’t really giving it a go. It seems like the side effect profile is far less extensive than that of “traditional” SSRIs, works faster, and doesn’t come with a black box warning. It’s also tailored specifically towards those with GAD, with (limited) evidence suggesting it may ease PD as well. What gives? ",1
"Hey all, I'm fairly new to Reddit so please be kind. As for the title, I started to take BUSpar (5mg)a few months back for my anxiety. I would only take them as needed. Then, around my PMS, I'd get so bad with my anxiety that I would take them as normal 3x a day (15mg). I stopped them for a while since I thought I was able to manage just fine without the meds. I started to cut them in half maybe about 2 months ago and noticed my libido has decreased dramatically. I've had crying spells and the sensation of derealization. Last month, I took the meds for 3 weeks straight and not take them for a whole week, and felt normal again within the week I didn't take them. I recently took them again as needed (2.5mg) and noticed the excessive fatigueness, drowsy, headaches, low libido, and being an emotional wreck. I also can't concentrate and made the derealization come back. I may have to stop taking BUSpar entirely. Anyone has/had this type of experience? I hope I make sense to this and not be alone in this rollercoaster lol",1
Hi everyone! I'm on 30mg of Buspar twice daily for physical anxiety. I'd like to get pregnant next year and I've received conflicting information from my medical providers about whether or not I can take it while pregnant. Has anyone had any experience with Buspar and pregnancy? ,1

I am currently finishing my first week of combining these medications and I have seen a massive improvement. The thoughts are still there, but I don't fret on them. Anyone else taking this combination? Will it only get better from here? I am pretty excited because how I feel compared to a month ago.. I feel like myself again. ",1
"I’m currently on Zoloft (Sertraline) for depression and anxiety, but I’ve been struggling with side effects like weight gain, sexual dysfunction, difficulty focusing and fatigue. I’ve done some research and am considering adding either Wellbutrin (Bupropion) or Buspar (Buspirone) to help address these issues.

My primary goal is to reduce weight gain and improve sexual side effects, but I’m also concerned about the potential for increased anxiety, fatigue, or even insomnia with these combinations.

For anyone who has combined Zoloft with Wellbutrin or Zoloft with Buspar, how did it work for you? Did it help with weight management and other side effects, and were there any new issues, especially with anxiety or insomnia? Any insights would be really appreciated!

"I just got put on bus par 7.5 mg. I’m new to taking anxiety medication’s. I started a month ago taking Celexa 20 mg when I went back to the doctor last week I told him I wasn’t really noticing a difference in the Celexa, so he added the bus par on top of the Celexa. Wouldn’t it have made more sense to just up my dosage of Celexa? Just wondering if anybody has had the same combination or taken that medicine at all and what your experience was with it",1
i’ve been having an anxiety panic attacks for like eight years and I really tried to stay away from medication. I did do like a two month stent on benzos which was great. I felt amazing but wasn’t feeling it and getting off of them was literally hell. I’m about a month off of benzos diazepam and I think I need to start something like Buspar.

"Hey all, I am on several medications for bipolar 2 and recently started taking Buspar as well. I see many *positive* experiences but I feel like I might be having a bad time with it. I am not seeking medical advice but I wonder if anyone has any negative anecdotal experiences to share?


My doctor said to watch out for ""sudden bursts of energy"" and a couple other smaller things but that's the main one I remember. I'm not sure if what I feel qualifies.


I feel like I need something (substance) to unwind. It's getting gradually more difficult to enjoy leisure time. I feel ""bored"" and nothing I do will satiate it. It's like I'd rather be at work on the clock working than sitting at home trying and failing to have leisure time watching TV or playing a (calm) game. I need to be distracted. And I only seem to be able to accomplish that with the use of alcohol or weed.


Weed and alcohol have both helped me until maybe they didn't, long story short. I don't have enough data to say if those things directly cause problems for me because they never used to, but I'm gonna try staying away for a bit. And now sitting here I feel the same sort of bad as I did before, without either of them in me. I desire one or the other at the moment, but they have both given me health anxiety from what I felt, and that's not really much better. (Weed makes my heart race and freaks me out, alcohol slowed my breathing down last night and made me uncomfortable and scared too. Everything feels perfect in the thick of it until I accidentally go an inch too far and then those things start and then I regret using at all that day and just wait for it to be over)


I feel like I want to go do stuff and I can't just sit down and relax, like I always have. I'm not sure if this qualifies as ""increased excitement, nervousness, or irritability"". I definitely feel irritated, I definitely feel excited about a dirty job that most people wouldn't be excited about. I feel excited about going to a dubstep concert or doing pushups or something which is new for me, which on its face sounds good but it's not usually me, I'm an introvert that enjoys leisure time and sitting around, and now I'm hating leisure time. The excitement feels negative to me only because it pairs with not being able to relax anymore. I definitely feel nervous about things like I did before (which is what led me to Buspar in the first place), it hasn't really seemed to get better. Saying it's worse may or may not be accurate, I can't decide on that.


But yeah. Anyone have a bad time with Buspar with other meds and decided to stop it and/or try a different one? Or did you just need to give it more time or fix something else in your life?",1
"I’m switch to hopefully Zoloft tomorrow but I was wondering if anyone else experienced dizziness after it wears off. I take 5mg at 8am and 5mg around 7pm and around 330 4 I notice I get dizzy/ lightheaded, anyone else? ",1
I’m 3 days into taking 7.5mg buspar daily and I feel like I’m a lot more sad and want to cry more. Has anyone felt this before? I got really depressed while being in Prozac for just a week and this kind of feels the same way but not as many bad thoughts.,1
"I was prescribed buspar because my lexapro has lost effectiveness after 5 years . Anyhow my psychiatrist said to take 5mg twice a day then after 5 days go to 10mg in the morning and 5mg at night then after 5 days again go straight to 10mg twice a day . Well anyway I went the first week at 5mg twice a day then two days 10mg morning 5mg at night and throughout this time I’ve had it with the heart palpitations so I just quit taking them . It’s 3 days off and anxiety is higher , I’m feeling dizzy or off balance , extreme nausea … is this possible withdrawal . Doc says it’s not possible because I haven’t even been on it that long but I swear I haven’t felt dizzy or off balance like this prior to taking this . Anyone had this happen after a short time of use ? ",1
"Not sure if this is even relevant, but I’m 15. Three weeks ago I started Buspar. I believe it was around 5-7.5 mg twice daily. At first, everything was fine. One thing I should mention is that I had forgotten to take the Buspar twice daily until two weeks ago today when I took one in the morning, and one in the afternoon when I was having an anxiety attack. Pretty quickly I felt twitchy and my limbs just felt heavy. I had no motivation to move and pretty much just sat staring into space until I mustered up enough energy to get up. Then, I realized that my legs were stiff and felt weak. In fact, all my muscles felt weak. At this point, my head and right hand were twitching pretty rapidly. I also couldn’t really walk. I was more so shuffling around the house rather than walking. After 2 hours of just laying down and waiting for the twitching and muscle weakness to stop, the twitching finally ended. However, I still felt extremely weak. The next day, I took one Buspar in the morning (I know, I shouldn’t have) and felt weak again. The twitching didn’t start again until I got up from my bed and started shuffling over to my kitchen. My mom was immediately concerned because my head was literally bobbing up and down at this point. She tried holding my head still, but the head nodding just got worse. Ended up going into urgent care, but they told my mom and I that we needed to go to the ER since they didn’t have the appropriate testing equipment. When I got to the ER, they took my vitals and gave me an EKG, then sent me out into a waiting room full of people. Turns out the wait time was 6 HOURS, but we didn’t know that until we told the receptionist we were leaving. While in the waiting room, my head nodding only got worse, which also worsened the pain in my shoulders and neck. That day, my head nodded up and down continuously for 3 hours until it magically stopped when I was laughing at something. If I had to guess, I think maybe the head nodding was real at first, but then maybe I just continued to nod my head even when the medication wore off because I was so used to doing it? Does that make sense? I’m pretty disappointed I can’t continue the Buspar, since it’s  the only anti anxiety med that I’m aware of that doesn’t cause drowsiness. Anyways, did anything similar happen to anyone else? This has been weighing on me for the past two weeks since it happened, and I’m curious how many people had similar reactions.",1

"So I have a red spot on my face that has been there over a year now, my primary Dr seemed kinda concerned and referred me back to a dermatologist, but last night I had fully convinced myself it was cancer after taking a close up picture and then using Google lens, I had a full blown panic attack that it was going to be the end for me, my mom passed away from skin cancer when I was 13, melanoma metastisized into her lungs. They took a spot off of me a couple years ago and biopsied but came back normal, but the two weeks in between were torture waiting on the call. I'm so so nervous to go back and then the wait on the biopsy if they do take it off... I'm a little more calm today after showing the pic to some coworkers and talking to them, bc if it is there is so much treatment now, and a lot of people I know here (in Florida) have actually had skin cancers before and I had no idea and everything is good with them now besides regular checks.

I started buspirone last week and just started getting a weird fluttering sound in one ear periodically. Like the sound of wind almost.

It's kind of counterproductive as now I worry about it happening. ,1

I just got out of a 3 year relationship and I think my amazing girlfriend is taking space to her self right now to figure things out, and I want todo the same too. Through out my life I have been an anxious person in and out of cbt and normal therapy, im very emotional, strong, and healthy. I know how to control myself and my anxiety without medication ( Ive never tried any anti depressants or Buspar) but I used to be a stoner etc lol.

Im unsure of how to get back into the real world with out my anxiety and fear or driving kicking my ass, or constantly having to hang out with people todo basic needs like run errands. I want to try buspar but am scared because ive never tried it. I want my independence back, but im so held back by my self the past week since the break. I know its just a season for me right now where things are extra hard but prior to this, I was on route to beating my fear , sometimes bringing myself places, and was very comfortable with my growth, family, relationship, and myself.

I recently got prescribed lexapro and I’ve been taking buspar for 4 months with slight relief. I’m worried about serotonin syndrome.

I always take my morning meds with breakfast, but if it matters that much, I can make sure to throw some crackers or something down with the nightly dose.

"Hi, I'm a little desperate here. Just genuinely curious if anyone has experienced anything similar to what I have and how they coped and got through it. I went to a psychiatrist because mental health problems runs in my family and I was just noticing anxiety about common things, but let me make it clear, it wasn't anything crazy. I still functioned on a day to day basis, went out in public, lived a normal life. I was diagnosed with a few things, and was prescribed an SSRI, I politely declined for the black box warning of potential increase in suicidal thoughts. In my follow up appointment, they basically sold Buspar to me, told me that it would be a good fit and doesn't carry the Black Box Label, so of course I took it. 7.5 mg one at morning and one at night. The first two days I was feeling great, the third day not so much. I started to panic, I was scared of EVERYTHING and started experiencing suicidal thoughts. My psychiatrist told me to stop taking it immediately. I did, I was okay, however, about a week passed and I woke up and suddenly my world was in shambles. I was having panic attacks. Suicidal thoughts. Anxiety about literally everything. Depressed. Feeling disconnected. It's now been a month and I am still like this. I do take Hydroxzine and have recently started counseling but I am so depressed and feel so disassociated. It's almost like I don't have control of anything about myself. I can't remember what it feels to be happy, I have literally only had the emotions of sad and mad. Has anyone else experienced a negative occurrence with Buspar? What helped you? I have talked to multiple doctors and it seems like all they want is to prescribe medication after medication, even after I have addressed that I do not and will not be open to anything with the Black Box label warning of increased suicidality.

"Hi, I just started taking my Buspar today. I take 10mg twice a day, in the morning and evening and I take it with food. I looked up other people’s experiences before I took my dose today to get a general idea of what I might feel. I definitely got the dizziness and tiredness that people mentioned, but that went away after awhile. I did get some pretty bad nauseousness, that is still lingering. I was just wondering if these things only happen after the first few weeks or is this a consistent thing? ",1
"So a few months back I did a full everything cleanse to re-evaluate my medication regiment. I did a thing called GeneSight testing where it looks at your DNA and determines the best medications for you. 

I was on Lexapro and then transitioned to Zoloft. Both where in the red section of “Do not take, severe drug interactions” so I stopped them.

The withdrawal process was hard but I was fine during it, actually felt pretty good.

Now my anxiety is back with a vengeance, probably the strongest it’s been in years. I can’t stop my thoughts, I’m constantly worried, constantly afraid I’ll just stop breathing or that my hearts gonna stop. My weight isn’t making it any better but it’s really hard to go to the gym when when you think and feel like your heart is about to stop at any given moment and that you’re gonna stop breathing 

( I did manage to jog 2 miles this week and lift some in the gym before losing my shit to anxiety and panic attacks but that’s a different story and I guess a success?)

So my psychiatrist has prescribed me buspirone at 5mg a day twice a day until my next appointment with her on July 1st. Today marks exactly 2 weeks taking it.

Now I’m not sure what exactly I’m feeling. Some days I have horrendous panic and anxiety. In fact I am anxious right now. Others I am okay. But the fact remains I’m still having some bad anxiety. Which lead me find a few Reddit threads about how Buspar made the anxiety worse or it was one of those “it helps or it don’t” meds. 

Do I stick it out until the 1st? That’s about 2 weeks out? Have I just not given it time to fully get into my system? I mean I’m a big dude at 6’ 4” 400lbs maybe 5mg just isn’t a noticeable dosage? Maybe that’s why it’s not in my system. I want to believe the medication helps me manage my issue. I know there is never truly going to be a cure or outright solution to anxiety but I want to have hope that I haven’t wasted the last 2 weeks trying something that ultimately failed.

And of course in the side effects is that it may make anxiety worse but it’s rare. Is my intrusive thoughts making me think I’m the special rare case? Why am I constantly worried about it

I’m looking for consensus",1

Was prescribed 10mg of Buspar 2x a day (morning and night 12 hours apart) I’ve been only taking half (5mg) but I’ve been feeling really weird these last 2 days just like mentally numb then angry then sobbing then completely nonverbal and incapable of caring for myself or anyone or anything else. The first 1-3 hours of the med make me tired but I can’t sleep more than 1-4 hours at a time I just get super restless and feel like electricity is running through my body and on the come down before I take it again I get shaky weak and my jaw clenches. I’ve also been able to eat only about 10 cheese it’s and a half a sandwich a day while taking it I’m also suddenly super constipated when I usually have anxiety diarrhea and I can’t say that it necessarily is helping my anxiety either.

By 6:15 I couldn’t even place a coherent thought together and everything around me started being very confusing and I felt lost. My boyfriend had to call 911. I was more scared than I’ve ever been. My brain is still feeling very foggy 2 days later. I have since been released from the hospital and have discontinued ALL medications for the meantime and will be fully discontinuing Buspar. Stay safe kids and know the signs! That way it doesn’t progress and you know when things aren’t normal!",1
"I have had like 5 major panic attacks a day every day for years but always refused treatment, finally last week I talked to my psych ab trying something for it and he put me on buspar, I waited a week to start it because I was really scared (still am) about new medications and so far what I’ve noticed is that when I stand up my head feels like it’s full of helium? Can anyone tell me what I should expect or share their experience I feel like I’m going in blind and I don’t want to google and find worst case scenarios LOL ",1
"Hello my fellow worriers!

I have been taking a prescribed combo of Wellbutrin (bupropion xl 150mg, once daily) and buspar (buspirone 10mg, 3x daily) for two months now. Since I started this regimen, I have had unbearable nausea every single morning. I wake up, and without fail I vomit within 10 minutes. I usually don't take my meds until after I throw up so they aren't just going to waste, so it has nothing to do with the immediate effects of the medication. I feel fine for the rest of the day after that point. I know nausea is a common side effect, especially with the buspar, but all the sources I've looked at suggest that the nausea should have subsided by this point.

Has anyone else experienced this, and did it go away eventually? Should I give it more time? ",1
"I just started taking BuSpar (or buspirone)about a week ago. Having some dizziness nausea fatigue and stomach issues, but nothing too terrible. However I am experiencing more feelings of despondency and depression.  Has anyone experienced this with this medication?",1
"started Buspar a little over a week ago at 5 mg two times a day And as of yesterday I started taking 10 milligrams in the morning and then five milligrams in the afternoon if needed.

Long story short just asking if any of you have had the following symptoms: my heart rate has increased for a little bit but it only lasted for about 20 minutes, I do sweat more but that doesn't last very long, I do have a bit of like light-headed dizzy ness but nothing to where I can't function. More like I'm fog minded,  but not really.....

All of this goes away Within 30 minutes of taking it but I am also on Adderall and 75mg effexor.  

I talked to my psychiatrist this upcoming Friday,  just more curious if this is like a temporary thing",1
"As the title states, my anxiety has been at its worst since an incident that caused a loss of consciousness. So I've been in extreme fear for that to happen again. My doc just sent over Buspar to assist. Does anyone have testimonials about the effects and if it has helped? Thank you guys and I hope you all are hanging in there with your anxiety! ",1
i have been on buspar 10mg once a day for three weeks and i have been experiencing extreme handshakes and heart palpitations especially when i wake up  it usually tones down through out the day but its there idk if its because the buspar or its just me,1
"Please tell me I’m not the only one that is feeling emotional blunting and apathy on Buspar. I thought I was crazy and one of my girlfriends even said that it could be because I am not anxious anymore but I don’t find life in ANYTHING ANYMORE

It feels like it’s changing my personality and things that I’ve liked (vivid colors, design, music, singing)! Even my range of empathy. Please tell me I’m not alone.  ",1
"Hey yall! I started BuSpar a little over a week ago. Started at 5mg at night. That gave me horrific insomnia. Started taking 5mg in the morning and another 5 mg at around 2 or 3 pm. I’m experiencing a lot of side effects. Like total brain fog, moving slow, headaches, just literally cannot think straight. It’s making it *really* hard to work and just be a productive human. I’ve been on SSRIs and SNRIs in the past and they did not work for me. I have major health anxiety so I feel like these side effects make it worse? Im trying to give it a shot though. Generally medications hit me pretty hard, so I don’t have plans to up the dose. Has any one else experienced these side effects? Do they go away? If so, how long does it take? ",1
"Does/did anyone take buspar for anxiety and how did affect you? Every time I take my pill(5Mg) I get brain zaps and feel like I’m gonna topple over any second cause my eyes feel weird. 
I’ve heard not many great things about buspar so I’m thinking of going back on hydroxyzine cause I think the buspar side effects are lasting all day.
Plus I can’t tell a difference.
Overall it makes my head and eyes feel weird which freaks me out. I feel like I’m gonna pass out anytime.",1
"I just got off the phone with the doctor and he prescribed me 10mg of buspar once a day. From what I understand, it should be twice a day. Has anyone else been prescribed it once a day? It's not easy to talk to a doctor where I live so I can't really ask for clarification now and I was too scared to say anything during my appointment. ",1
Hi so I recently started taking buspar but I hear it makes your cognition slower I get test anxiety would be it be smart to still take my buspar a few hours before the exam or would that make me not score as well? Anybody have experience with this? ,1
I just took took my first dose of Buspar 30 mins ago and omg my brain is like firing off. This must be the brain zaps I’ve heard of 😩 what do I do ? Will it go away is there anything to do to chill it out this is crazy I’m panicking,1
"I started taking Buspar for anxiety about 3 weeks ago and I think it's helping in that department but my sleep has gone to shit. In the last week and a half I haven't slept a full night, I will wake up at 2AM and then again at 4AM and then again at 5. It's getting pretty exhausting. 

Does anyone else have experience with this? Should I start taking my second dose earlier in the evening? Right now I take it just before bed and I didn't realize that Buspar can cause sleep issues. I'm hoping that's the cause and not something else",1
"I recently got diagnosed with moderate GAD and possible ADHD after going to see a psychiatrist and was prescribed 10mg of buspar a day. I've been pretty anxious for my whole life and started having multiple panic attacks a week starting a few months ago, so I decided to seek out meds because I'm in college and feeling like I'm dying all the time is starting to negatively affect my ability to do work lol. I've never been on any prescribed drugs besides like antibiotics so I'm pretty nervous about side effects--especially as I've had negative physical reactions to other things like weed and cough syrup before (both have made me shake uncontrollably and hallucinate). I've taken Ativan before because I went to the hospital once while having like a 12hr long panic attack and they gave me it and I just remember being incredibly chilled out so I'm hoping that happens again lol. has anyone had negative or positive experiences on 10mg of buspirone as their first-ever drug? ",1
"I’m taking buspar 10mg twice a day, however I’ve been having crazy insomnia and I haven’t been able to sleep. is it okay to take 10mg of melatonin at bedtime? really needing some relief",1
Just as the title says my dr said he thinks adding 5 mg of buspar for the first 2 weeks and then 10 mg of buspar twice a day after on top of my Lexapro 20 mg will help with my panic disorder/agoraphobia. Right now I can’t go far from home and I have to have someone close with me. It’s put a huge strain on my life as when I got on Lexapro I have the want to go out and do things but I feel it’s such a mental block stopping me. I’m too scared to try the buspar yet I’ve siked myself out reading google about serotonin syndrome and well and the pharmacist warning me of it too 🥲 I guess I’m just looking for success stories with similar medications? Assurance ? Something to help because maybe this could be the medication combo to help me through,1
"tl;dr: I started Buspar and developed a panic disorder while on vacation in Ireland. 

In October 2022 I started taking Buspar for GAD. Prior to starting I had only moderate anxiety attacks. In November 2022 while on a trip to Dublin Ireland I found myself needing to use the restroom (#2). Being in the middle of downtown Dublin I couldn’t find a restroom and started to panic fearing I would have an accident. Fortunately I did find a pub and was able to mitigate the issue. A few days later my wife and I were on a tour bus from Dublin to Kilkenny. I boarded the bus and started to panic about the possibility of needing a bathroom on the 1.5 hour ride. I freaked out and got off the bus leaving my wife and headed to a coffee shop to find a bathroom. The bus almost left me but I got on and sat through a panic attack for the entire ride. I again did not have an accident. 

Over a year later I’ve finally worked through my fear of driving or being away from restrooms thanks to 100 mg of Zoloft and CBT therapy. Has anyone else had a panic disorder form due to Buspar? ",1
Hi! Any side effects taking it with spiro?? I’m on 100mg as well and afraid to combine,1
And can I ask what it feels like when it works? You just feel calmer? Like when an ssri kicks in? Etc? Lol,1
"On 10 mg 2x daily for about a year now. Helps me feel normal when nothing is happening, but when something even remotely stressful happens that all goes out the window. Planning on switching off of it soon",1
"On 10 mg 2x daily for about a year now. Helps me feel normal when nothing is happening, but when something even remotely stressful happens that all goes out the window. Planning on switching off of it soon",1
I hated it. I had a reaction to it that my chest and stomach felt like it was on fire,1
Too intense for me. Made me feel like I was on a low vibration. Had to lie down,1
Same here buspar made me worse and almost su*cidal,1
"I noticed that it only lasted about 90 minutes. I was on 60 a day and sort of ignored his dosage because the stuff actually worked. I'd tried different timings. He scolded me, but admitted 90 was ok. I have to set an alarm and count out the pills every morning, or I'll forget that I've already taken it because it takes a bit to take effect. I took way too much for a few days and found out that I get the spins over 90. That's when I decided to set an alarm on my phone starting at 6 am, then every 2 hours until 10 pm. I also take bupropion at 6am and 6pm ... max dose.

It has given me a remarkable turnaround. I was depressed from 50 to 55 really bad. Once I got the right meds ... I haven't felt this good since 4th grade",1
I've never tried propranolol. I don't think I've taken hydroxyzine either. Although hydroxyzine does sound familiar. I'll have to look them up,1
Anyone know how long Buspar takes to work,1
Looking back ... I think the adjustment period was interesting at first. Like the dosage was low and days the anxiety would be really bad but I’m not sure if it was be adjusting the first few weeks or if the dosage was too low,1
Did you have hair loss from wellbutrin?,1
Idk I just have anxious thoughts still but they just don’t affect me or feel like anything? Idk I still feel other emotions,1
"Very well. Honestly, best anxiety medicine I’ve ever been on. The first 2-3 days I was very nauseous and had stomach aches but after that, it truly helped with my anxiety so much. I haven’t felt as good in years in regards to my anxiety",1
"Yeah I'm not sure but when I was on celexa I've literally had to force myself to laugh in certain situations that I'd laugh naturally, it was meh. Lol",1
"No, I needed something a little more extended than buspar so I switched to Zoloft a year and a half ago and added on Wellbutrin about a year later",1
I’m currently on Pristiq and Buspar. I have ADHD that I don’t treat with medication and I haven’t found Pristiq to be stimulating at all. I still have times where I feel depressed and I’ll have anxiety but I’m not having full blown back to back panic attacks that last days or weeks like I had previously. I’ve been on many many different different meds prior to buspar I was on gabapentin which helped me feel more mellow. I don’t mess with narcotics because they trigger depersonalization/derealization and severe paranoia,1
"Thanks man I’m not offended at all. I never really been addicted to drugs. I just partied when I was young, but I will say that my body got dependent on those Klonopin real quick and that’s why I got off them immediately but you’re totally right. I’m super scared to try anything because this mental health shit is fucking, my life",1
I haven't done this ever since that was 8 years ago,1
buspar gave me debilitating brain zaps 😍,1
Have you tried Zoloft? I’m wondering if that reducing social anxiety and panic attacks or just social. I’ve heard good things about Prozac as well. Sounds like lexapro isn’t always the best for anxiety,1
Lmao,1
And I smoke weed all day now but I wouldn’t necessarily recommend that,1
Im switching from ativan to buspar in about a month so let’s hope it works for me! I need a daily relief not a twice a week thing that’s my main reason for switching,1
Biuapar gave me intense anger,1
"PGY-1 on an IM rotation at an OSH.  As it's Psych adjacent I got a somewhat challenging case dumped in my lap and I'm struggling to handle it without any of my Psych seniors or attendings to turn to.  Part of the struggle is that I have a number of complicated patients and don't have the time to actually dive  into the patient psych history and gather collateral.  Additionally I seem to be caught in the middle of a finger pointing turf war between Psych and Neuro -- and neither service seems particularly sharp or have bothered to do a proper investigation. 

Briefly \~70 yo who received anesthesia \~ 4 months ago and within a day or two began undergoing pretty drastic, progressive changes -- with 48 hours expressing SI, and significantly increased anxiety and progressive difficulty with memory.  Patient was treated at an inpatient facility that no-one has bothered to get records for and started on unknown medications.  Continued worsening until \~ 1 week ago when he was admitted to a sister hosptial's inpatient ward. Notes from that admission are unrevealing as the patient was deemed unable to have a meaningful interview due to neurocognitive decline.  I haven't had the time to piece together the exact medications but it appears they were trialed on mirtazapine with quetiapine PRNs for agitation with Trazodone for sleep before coming to us on 10mg Escitalopram and 5mg Buspar.   About 5 days ago patient had orthostatic hypotension and was transferred to my hospital and I came on service 3 days ago.  Iniitally no psychotropic changes other than haloperidol 5mg PRN for agitation. 

Workup here has consisted of LP and MRI w/wo contrast which have so far been unrevealing. Psychiatry has claimed this is primarily neurologic (rapidly progressive dementia) Neurology believed this to be primary psychiatric (severe anxiety, or possibly prion) until 3 days ago when they decided the patient has serotonin syndrome on the basis of tremor and hyperreflexia (+3 in patellar and achilles, +2 elsewhere).  Neurology also noticed for the first time clonus at ankle.  I had low suspicion but recognized that I have limited experience, that Serotonin syndrome can have a varied presentation, and that neurology would not engage in further attempts to find differentials without running down this lead reluctantly followed their recommendations. Buspar has been stopped for two days and Escitalopram is now down to 5mg and will be stopped by week end.  Against my better judgement given age, patient is now on 2mg Diazepam PO BID with 2mg IM PRN for agitation (which has not been needed).  There has been no improvement in neurological or psychiatric symptoms.   
  
Today, Neurology forced me to call poison control for further treatment recommendations (who also expressed skepticism and did not recommend any changes), and further diagnosed patient with catatonia.  Which...may actually be the case as Neurology reported posturing  and rigidity (I had not observed either), but leaves me unsure how to proceed. I am surprised that the diazepam has at best had no improvement, and at worst may have precipitated this, but I also know that significant amounts of benzos can be required for treatment so lack of improvement doesn't necessarily signify anything.   

 I plan to do a Bush Francis tomorrow to see for myself, but it will be my first time performing one.  My understanding is that as long as any two of the criteria are scored that a catatonia diagnosis can be made and further evaluation is for severity. Is that a correct understanding?  Beyond that, I have read that in geriatric populations as little as .5mg Ativan can be used for a challenge (I am unsure if I would even be allowed to perform at this hospital) and that Zolpidem may have some efficacy as a challenge drug as well. How do you all go about diagnosing catatonia in the, especially hospitalized, geriatric population? ",1
"Hi everyone I am a 3rd year medical student. Ive been thinking a lot about the role of long-term Benzos in anxiety disorders lately and wanted to hear everyone's opinions. Kind of a long post but thanks for reading my thoughts and bearing with me, I mostly focused on SSRI/SNRI and benzos since those are the main treatments even though obviously there are others (buspar, antihistamines, gabapentin, etc.)

From all of my research and experience I know nowadays lots of people are all about ""no benzos bad!"" for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders due to risks of tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, future risk of dementia, sedation, cognitive blunting, etc. However, how are these risks any different from SSRI/SNRI? For example I take a high dose of duloxetine personally for anxiety. If I miss even one dose I get horrible dizziness, brain ""zaps"" where I feel like my head will explode, nausea, vomiting, jitteriness/increased anxiety, etc. It is terrible. I would 100% say im dependent on duloxetine and would need to slowly wean off the medicine, similar to a benzo taper. I have heard of similar symptoms with other SSRI/SNRI in friends/relatives etc. I have also heard of patients complain of fatigue, drowsiness, mental dulling, and other similar symtoms from antidepressants so negatively attributed to benzodiazepines. Also, some patients report that their antidepressants just stopped working after a time, sounds like tolerance to me? 

SSRI/SNRI are more associated with troubling side effects like nausea, vomiting, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, etc. than from what I have seen with benzodiazepines. And from all that I have read, antidepressants only achieve remission in approx. 1/3 patients and the anxiolytic properties of the medicine can take up to months to manifest whereas benzos can be within hours or days. And some patients have such severe panic/agoraphobia, etc. that their lives are essentially destroyed, should they really not be on a benzodiazepine still?

As for the increased risk of dementia/cognitive impairment from benzos, I have researched a lot on pubmed and other sites and the research seems really convoluted and kinda 50/50. Some articles say there is increased risk, some say no effect whatsoever, some say there just isn't enough evidence to come to a conclusion, and I even just read a meta-analysis earlier today that found some evidence that long-term benzo use may have a small protecting effect against dementia???! Other articles found that upon discontinuation of the benzo any impairment in cognitive function was regained whereas others said there was permanent deficits. 

&#x200B;

So overall, do you all think benzos are just horrible drugs for anxiety long-term or is there a definite place for them? are they getting a bad rap whereas SSRI/other antidepressant are marketed much better? I don't have an opinion either way just really curious to hear from people who have a lot more psychopharmacology knowledge and experience than myself

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading and educating me",1
"So, i'm not sure where to begin. This might be a long and uninteresting post, but I would love it if someone could give some opinions about what I should do next. English is not my first language either, so if you notice any obvious grammatical/spelling errors, there you have it. 

I'm going to provide sort of like a timeline, or just sketch it up to what I feel right now, and what i've been through, and everything.

I'm a 21 (soon 22) year old male, and as of now, I suffer from EXTREMELY crippling GAD (general anxiety disorder, but I think that you guys know that), Panic Syndrome with agoraphobia, and social anxiety. 
I've always had the social anxiety throughout my entire life, but it's my recently developed mental conditions that are ruining my life. On top of that, or well, more enveloped in those diagnoses, I'm a hypochondriac, i'm terrified of diseases and especially those type of acute ailments such as heart attacks and strokes/aneurysms. But i've had that all my life, but during my first 20 years my fear was more about cancer and more long-lasting illnesses. 
I was easily depressed during my teens, but that had more to do with the fact that I had very low self-esteem (and I still do) but as soon as I started to get attention from girls that faded away. Since then i've been an upbeat and generally happy guy, and I still am, most people don't notice it through my anxiety though, and it's very often that I can't feel either sad nor happy since fear takes over everything. 

It all started approximately a year and half ago, when I was smoking weed at a friends house (not my first time either, and I know that was foolish of me), and I got my first panic attack. 
I told them to call an ambulance because I thought I was having a stroke or something (the lights kept fading in and out and my entire face was numb, and i could barely stand up), and well, they didn't because they understood that it was in fact something that had to do with the weed. 
I could barely move for several hours because my body was so weak and I was petrified, but the feeling soon vanished. 
After that I was fine, completely fine, for about a week. Then a second panic attack came along, and this time without the help of any sort of drug usage. (I abstained from alcohol and any sort of drugs until I was 20, and i completely stopped drinking and smoking weed when i started getting my panic attacks). I was terrified, and I couldn't understand what was going on, I thought for sure that I was about to die. Anyhow, I started getting more and more frequent panic attacks, and developed General Anxiety Disorder in between the attacks, and soon anxiety started to rule my life. I because more reclusive and I didn't want to go out to bars or hang out with friends anywhere other than my home, but I sometimes managed to get myself together and go to a movie or just hang out somewhere else than my home, and I could occasionally do some errands. But working or studying was impossible, I actually had to drop my Dutch studies because I just couldn't go to school with my anxiety. 
It just so happened that my anxiety went up and down all the time and I could never know what to expect from it, and every time, every symptom was extremely physical, most of the time I never knew that I was even scared or stressed out myself. 
Anyway, about two months back I had an EXTREME panic attack that manifested itself as cardiac symptoms (chest pain, a numb left arm, extremely rapid heartbeat, some other areas of pain, hard to breathe, etc) and I had to call an ambulance. Turns out that there's nothing wrong with my heart, and that I don't have any (known) somatical diseases, besides some eczema on my scalp and acne and whatnot. 
I've done several EKG's and it seems like there's nothing wrong with me. 

Anyway, after that incident i've been terrified to do anything that involves physical strain on my body, because I've felt like my heart can't take it. I used to love taking walks even with my anxiety, for a month after the incident I was too scared to even go for a 10-minute walk around the block. 
My legs turn to spaghetti but are also extremely heavy, I can't breathe at all and I get paresthesia throughout parts of my body, so I immediately start to draw the conclusion that my heart is damaged and can't handle the stress. 
So now here I am... i've started to handle it a bit better, but I can't go anywhere outside of the small suburb that I live in, and I prefer only being outside for a short time, as short as I can really, and this is completely ruining my life. 

I have EXTREMELY physical symptoms of my anxiety (which I still fear is something else than pure anxiety alone), and paresthesia and pain in my left arm (which according to doctors and physiotherapists are nerve or muscular pains or just psychosomatic entirely), and general back pain mostly focused on my left shoulder and especially my left shoulder blade (everytime I move it, it makes a, or actually several ""popping"" sounds..) and i've been going to chiropractors, naprapaths and physiotherapists and have only found very short-term relieve of my physical symptoms, and not all of it. 

As you might guess from my diagnosis, i'm very very skeptical and frightened of medicines and especially side effects. 
Right now i'm on 225 mgs of Lyrica (Pregabalin) and 10 mgs of Buspar a day, and I find that it barely helps me at all. 
My muscles are so tense, and my body is in a constant state of anxiety and my fight or flight-responses are always triggered, i'm so easily startled. And most of all my pulse is elevated, my body feels just... wrong, I can hardly ever breathe, and my entire body hurts. My pain is almost to the point of getting close to Fibromyalgia, but since i'm a 21 year old male, my chances of having that are pretty slim. 
I refuse to eat SSRI's and SNRI's because i'm just too scared of side effects and the first weeks of increased anxiety (because my anxiety is already TOO FUCKING HIGH), and my doctor just keeps wanting me to either eat Cymbalta or take an neuroleptic (without me being psychotic or suffer from any sort of diagnosis that's not anxiety-related), i'm not bipolar or suffer from borderline, i'm not even depressed. 

BUT HERE IS THE REAL KICKER: I've applied, and managed to get into a 3-year archaeological program at the university in the city where I live, and it starts IN A WEEK. 
And my psychiatrist wants to put me on SNRI's which she knows elevates anxiety levels during the first week, without any sort of relief for that anxiety. 
I'm still too scared because the physical symptoms I get whenever I try to leave the confines of my small suburb, like taking the u-train, the bus, or even a car ride, makes me feel like i'm about to die. It's not panic anxiety, it's just so much general anxiety on such an extreme level that it's ruining my life, made me lose my dream girl, and just makes me have to live at home with no income whatsoever, because I can't keep a job even if I tried to.

So right now, 225 mgs of Lyrica a day but according to my doctor she doesn't want me to raise my dosage on it because she thinks that I'll always have to increase the dosage (which might be true) and the Buspar that i'm on, triggered some sort of paranoid delusions (I thought that I was going to die, got images of me in the hospital and just felt trapped and closed in when I was OUTSIDE, and at one point I thought I had died, and the bus stop was some sort of purgatory... SAY WHAAAT), which is completely unlike any of my usual symptoms, and even on a very very low dosage, just 15 mgs a day. 

So what should I take, what should ask for, when i'm too scared of the typical SSRI's or SNRI's, and just generally don't respond to antihistamines as an anxiolytic? The ONLY thing that has worked so far is benzodiazepines, but here in Sweden doctors are generally against it, but especially MY doctor, she refuses to even give me any for the first period if i try an SNRI (which I'm also against because of the sexual side effects, something that i'm also experiencing from my Lyrica, i don't want to worsen it)... Oxezapam which is an extremely weak benzodiazepine is the standard here in Sweden, I won't even get that. It's weaker than valium and xanax. we also have Ativan but it's NEVER prescribed unless you've tried all the other medicines. 
I know that benzodiazepines could help me with my studies, but at a high cost. But I can't get anything like that, I think it's unfair because If i can't study now, i'll be completely cut off from any sort of chance at getting money, because we get paid to study here in Sweden, oh well. 
I'm also starting CBT soon but I hate my psychologist, because I can't relate to her at all (which isn't a problem i usually have, she's just cold and generally un-empathetic), so that's of course something that i'm going to try, but I need something to take down my general anxiety first.

That's about it... any sort of insight or advice for what I should ask for when it comes to medicines, or just a kind word... go for it. Ask me anything, say anything. 
Just try to help me if you can, thank you.

"Guanfacine xr bedtime dosing can help with sleep, anxiety, nightmares, and attention",1
Zyprexa for acute flares of anxiety?? Woah.,1
Why is this comment being down voted? Nothing about this is incorrect,1
"That simply isn’t true. Every time the topic of chronic benzos comes up there, the vast majority of comments/upvotes are about how dangerous and ineffective they are",1
">ty. Gabapentin is as strong as I'll go. If someone needs PRN benzos, what they really need is exposure therapy. I say this as someone who once had crippling social and flying anxiety. As in panic attacks for two weeks before and after a flight. What helped me was more flights. Unless a trigger is known meds don't even work fast enough to actually help.

Do you know what reason is missing? 

Therapeutic efficacy. 

You even listed placebo as a positive lol. 

My biggest problems with Buspirone is that it's exactly that a placebo that causes lightheadedness and dizziness (sometimes vertigo) and brain fog/mild cognitive impairment. 

What off-label indications are you referencing? 

As far as I knew and upon double checking real quick, it seems the only indication it has alleged therapeutic efficacy for would be specifically Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).

I've only found sources specifically stating that it lacks efficacy for Social Anxiety Disorder (which I found a bit surprising, but I have found some very minimal and limited evidence that it may have some efficacy for social anxiety), Separation Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Withdrawal Syndromes, Discontinuation Syndromes & Rebound Syndromes, especially lacking for Phobias & Panic Disorder, Insomnia/Sleep deprivation or Sleep anxiety, C-PTSD or PTSD as well as HVD. And no value for Personality disorders, not that I was anticipating that but just to mention as it relates to anxiety. 

It also has 0 immediate effect, and takes 2-6 weeks for it to begin having an effect. So it's definitely not applicable for any type of a as-needed anxiety which really narrows it's already narrow range of use. 

And while it is true, that other than the 3 mild adverse reactions I listed previously, Buspirone tends to be a fairly harmless & easily tolerable drug. It does increase the risk of Serotonin Syndrome but not by much, as well as lowers the drug-induced seizure threshold. But most importantly, It is true that within the dosage range of 5-100 mgs, it can cause a variety of persistent drug-induced movement disorders. And that's a very serious thing. 

But I seriously don't understand why prescribers even prescribe it, I've never seen someone say they're doing good on it. Just sorta null response and then mentioning the lightheadedness/dizziness. 

While I disagree with a lot of the fear-mongering and refusal to consider the usage of Benzodiazepines ever that's been going on in recent years, I don't understand why providers don't just use, SSRI's/SNRI's, SARI's, Pregabalin, Alpha-2-Adrengenic agonists like Guanfacine/Clonidine, hell even Beta-blockers before Buspirone. I really fail and struggle to see in what instances, Buspirone is the superior option to go with. Especially as a 1st line treatment. Could you help explain what I'm missing?",1

"The miraculous-ness in itself is kind of the problem. Benzos work great and fast. So great, in fact, that a lot of people take them and then go “I just want to feel like that all of the time”. Keeping in mind how similar they are to alcohol, it becomes a familiar story. 

The first problem is that, unlike SSRIs, benzos cause some level of acute intoxication. At low doses where this is mild, it may not be all that significant for most people. But there are a decent number of jobs where it’s either explicitly forbidden by policy (pilots) or legally / ethically dicey (surgeons). 

The acute “buzz” (however mild) also makes benzos a bad option for people with a history of substance use disorders. It can trigger a relapse on their original drug of choice (especially if it was a sedative) or a new problem. 

Assuming none of that is a problem, benzos make people feel better instantly. They’re really good at letting people just kind of zone out. It’s a pleasant feeling. Benzos let people just stop thinking about their problems - which gets in the way of both processing the bad things that have happened to them and trying to actually solve their problems. There’s limited evidence that benzos increase rates of PTSD after acute trauma (and none that they reduce it). 

After not very long, that pleasant feeling starts to go away. Which leads to doses that escalate pretty quickly over time. This is also the point at which some patients may not feel like the doctor is prescribing enough and seek them out elsewhere. Higher doses have increasing risk and there’s not usually a clear end game. 

Oh, and if you miss a dose, you feel absolutely awful. Which reinforces the belief that this is the only medication that works and the patients “anxiety” (withdrawal) is just intolerable without benzos. Also, the withdrawal can kill you pretty easily (as could drinking too much or taking some other opioids / sedatives at any time, for the record).

Finally, even with people using PRN doses for anxiety who don’t develop a substance use disorder or physiologic tolerance - its a short term solution.

This is fine for someone who needs an ativan to fly twice a year and doesn’t have the resources or energy to “conquer” (deal with in therapy) that fear. It becomes problematic when someone needs an ativan to leave the house. They take an ativan and go outside three times a week for an hour to do their shopping, but it severely disincentivizes patients to engage with the harder long term solutions, like therapy. It doesn’t fundamentally change anything about the patient’s situation or coping abilities. It doesn’t help move their life forward. It can be enabling, in some settings. 

SSRIs / SNRIs or even adjuncts like gabapentin or the various things with anti-histamine action are lower risk in almost all settings. 

All that to say - I don’t think benzos are horrible. They can be very helpful in a variety of settings. I don’t have a problem with PRN benzos. I don’t have a problem with short courses on scheduled benzos. I don’t have a problem with the few rare situations that truly necessitate long term benzos after trying everything else. What I do have a problem with is prescribing benzos without a plan for stopping them that’s explicitly discussed with the patient. If it’s for PRN, it’s the boundaries of things like frequency are and what the expectations are in terms of things like therapy / other active treatments. If scheduled, I will talk about the plan for getting off of them, what else we’re starting that may take longer to kick in, and what long term medicine we’ll try next if this one doesn’t work. 

With the appropriate framing and boundaries, they can be a great tool. The problem is the rarity of the framing and boundaries in general practice.",1

Abstract  
Clonazepam (CNZ) is a drug used for insomnia treatment. Our objective was to search CNZ effects on executive functions (EF) in patients with chronic primary insomnia (CPI)-CNZ treated. Ninety participants were studied divided into three groups: a group of patients with CPI only (n = 30), a group of patients with CPI-CNZ treated (n = 30) and a healthy control drug-free subjects group (n = 30). EF were examined by means of E-Prime and by the Tower of London tests. Data of the EF were compared between groups, and correlation calculations between EF and CNZ dose were performed. Patients with CPI-CNZ treated showed more deleterious effects on EF (attention, inhibition, working memory, planning, cognitive flexibility, and monitoring) than patients with CPI only. Attention and cognitive flexibility correlated with CNZ dose. In conclusion, CNZ treatment was associated with deficits in some EF in patients with CPI-CNZ treated compared to CPI only and controls. We found a dose dependency between CNZ and some EF deficits.",1

"Hey all, been on 10MG Paxil daily for 5-6 years now (33/M) and it has been absolutely wonderful. I had my first random panic attack back in 2018 when I was between jobs, had me in the hospital because I felt like I was losing my mind. Doctor put me on 10mg Paxil, that took...maybe a month or two to fully kick in? Been fine ever since...up until a month ago. I decided to start weening myself off Paxil because I felt like I was back to normal around November '23, when my dad was put in the hospital. Took half a pill (10mg) every other day until my dad passed last month, between the stress of starting a new job, buying a house, losing a parent and realizing I only have my almost 80 year old mother left, I broke.

I started going back on my daily Paxil dose, but felt like I needed some help until it kicked back in, as I felt I was losing my mind again. Doctor prescribed me 10mg Buspar ""as needed"" which worried me a bit because everything I found on Buspar said it needed consistent dosage to be effective. Two days into my Paxil and Buspar 2x a day, I'm seeing results, day by day until about 10 days in, I feel like myself again. I decided to come off the Buspar and go as needed, but two days later, last Saturday, I felt the anxiety creeping back in. I've been taking my Buspar again every 12 hours for 3 days so far, but I'm not seeing much improvement, especially nowhere near like I did before. I do notice though, I tend to feel about 90% normal at night, about the time I get off work and head home. I take Buspar in the morning around 11AM when I get up, and Buspar and Paxil together when I get home around 11PM. 

  
I keep telling myself the medication needs time to ramp back up  to level me out again, but man.. I hate how easily it is to feel like I'm not in control. I'd really like to come off the Buspar at some point and just go back to my Paxil and be fine, but it feels like I might be stuck taking more pills for a while. Anyone else on this combination? It would be nice to get some insight about roughly how long it took for anyone else to feel normal again. I want to feel like myself again, even if it means taking some extra pills to help. ",1

Just got back from the doctor after a battery of tests left with a clean bill of health….annnd realized I had forgotten to take my buspar for a week now (on a fairly small dosage).

I have been experiencing severe pain in all of my joints, cramped muscles, I have pins and needles and a vague headache and nausea and now with no other explanation, wondering if it was the buspar.",1
"I put myself through a lot this past year in terms of my mental wellbeing, and wondered if any of you folks had input on my situation or had a similar experience of going on an AD, switching to another one, then switching back to your old one.

I was formally diagnosed with depression/anxiety when I was 19 and my psychiatrist put me on lexapro 10mg. It worked wonderfully for a year, but once I was 20 I began to experience depression/anxiety again very suddenly so my dosage was upped to 20mg. Again, the lexapro was working amazingly, I remember never having felt so happy and content before and feeling like I finally made it. However, being at 20mg I was extremely tired everyday (needed daily naps) and gained a lot of weight (around 25 pounds, which was a lot for a 5 foot 3 girl). The weight gain really took a huge toll on me, none of my clothes fit anymore and I started to think to myself that I would never be able to lose weight if I stayed on lexapro. I convinced myself that I was absolutely fine to stop taking medication because mentally I was in a good place (while on lexapro of course...lol), so my psychiatrist (a new one this time) helped me ween off of it this year March. Obviously ended up being a terrible decision because I mentally deteriorated and almost ruined my relationship with my s/o until I realized I should have never gotten off the medication in August after my biggest mental breakdown ever.

I got put on wellbutrin XL (300mg) + buspar (20mg, x2 a day) in August, and it has been about 3.5 months since I started and this is where I was looking for opinions/thoughts. My psychiatrist put me on wellbutrin because I was afraid of gaining weight (I managed to lose 20 pounds during those couple of months I got off lexapro) and buspar because of my anxiety. I was super optimistic because my older sister had depression (no anxiety though) and wellbutrin XL was great for her, so I assumed it would be great for me too because genetics. Honestly, I'm nowhere near as terrible as I was when I was unmedicated, but I am also nowhere near as happy as I was when I was on lexapro. I have been getting into fights with my s/o, nothing too crazy but also something I am not proud of. This is a bit weird but I measure how well my medication is working by looking at my relationship with him. On 20mg of lexapro, we would have 1 argument maybe once every half a year, and I always felt in control of myself with a clear logical head. Unmedicated it was probably 1-2 arguments every week, and right now it's probably 1-2 arguments every month. My s/o is an amazing person, he is kind, loving and everything I could have ever asked for, so every time we do argue it's because of me. I feel like the wellbutrin has made me an angry person, which is a common side effect early on, but it has been more than 3 months and I am still sooo unhinged. I also do not feel particularly happy, and am sad much more often than usual (sometimes for no actual reason). The buspar is absolutely useless, everyday I have a racing heart for no reason and I feel nervous for literally anything. I could be going to the gym and I'll get anxious at just the fact that I have a bus to catch (this is a daily occurrence).

I know it sounds like the answer is obvious: switch back to lexapro. It's killed 2 birds (depression and anxiety) with 1 stone and I felt so normal on it. I don't feel like myself right now, and I haven't felt like myself ever since I got off lexapro. I don't know if I should give wellbutrin + buspar a longer chance, but its been 3.5 months and they've hardly worked. At this point I feel like I'm putting my relationships with my family, friends and s/o in danger and most importantly myself. I can't lie I am so scared of gaining weight again, the difference between then and now however is that I am active and go to the gym. Yet I still know that going to the gym and dieting while on lexapro may mean nothing, which is why I am scared. The thought of my clothes not fitting anymore and seeing myself in the mirror is making me doubt myself. I know it sounds like all I care about is my appearance, but as a 22 year old college girl that is unfortunately very important to me. I'm going to see my psychiatrist soon, and the last time I spoke with her she suggested benzodiazepines which spooked me. I couldn't believe that lexapro outright obliterated my anxiety, meanwhile I'm on 40mg of buspar a day which is an insane dosage and I am literally nervous to take the bus...",1

"Hey guys,

I'm a 22 year old college student who has been suffering with depression and anxiety, and most notably, depersonalization for a couple of years now due to what I believe to have been adrenal fatigued resulting from a bout of severe panic attacks. I tried to deal with it on my own for a few months with zero, or perhaps even negative success. So then I tried therapy with an on campus psychologist with some success in regards to thought recognition and a small sense of control. However, this merely touched the surface of my issues. 

Some real relief began after visiting a psychiatrist as recommended by my campus psychologist. At first she began me on Lexapro 5mg, then increased to 10mg. This helped slightly with my anxiety, but not depression and also had some side effects I didn't find acceptable. It made me feel flat, emotionless, and without libido. I guess an optimistic person would have called me ""stable."" Anyways, after bringing this to her attention, she decided to add Wellbutrin in conjunction to my Lexapro, which was a good idea on her part. The Wellbutrin relieved my depression the most, and counteracted most of Lexapro's side effects, minus the libido problem. 

Though Wellbutrin helped a little, neither of these medications addressed my depersonalization problem completely. Wellbutrin did relieve me of my crippling anhedonia and obsessive thoughts though, so that was a start. I started to gain a lust for life again, but the feeling still felt shallow and detached from myself. Though I could gain momentary pleasure again, like when playing video games, I still lacked the overall containment feeling I once had taken for granted. 

After deciding I couldn't any longer put up with Lexapro's side effects, and since it wasn't helping me enough to justify them, my psych took me off of Lexapro and replaced it with Buspar 10mg, 2x daily. 

It's hard to tell, but I don't think the Buspar is doing much for me. Nowadays and thanks to my CBT therapy, most of my anxiety is no longer as thought provoked and is usually either completely random and physical (jitteriness, heart increase, fear feeling in the chest, etc.) or aggravated by specific situations, like speaking to attractive girls or speaking in public (which isn't good, being a Communication Major). 

I brought up my concerns regarding Buspar to my psych, who recommended I increase my dose of the Buspar. However, I've done alot of research on beta blockers (I'm nearly a college graduate, I know how to distinguish academic content from BS content), and ended up persuading her to let me try a course of the beta blocker Propranolol 10mg 2x daily, which I will start tomorrow. Im hoping this medication will reduce or eliminate the random feelings of ""adrenalin rushes"" I seem to get. 

My question is this. Should I have tried increasing my dose of Buspar as recommended by my psych, or have I made an informed choice in wanting a trial of Propranolol? I'd like to remphasize that my anxiety symptoms are not usually thought-provoked anymore, and now they are either random or perpetuated by specific situations not relating to my thoughts, but always physical in nature.  

I'd also like to know if Wellbutrin and Propranolol can work together effectively, given their slightly counterintuitive mechanisms of action? 

Just looking for some insight here. I'm gonna go ahead and give it a trial run regardless, but I guess I'm the kind of person who doesn't do very well with ambiguity. 

I appreciate any help you guys could provide. Thanks.",1

"Hello, I’ve been medicated since age 10. Nothing has helped, either had zero effect or made me worse in other ways. 

I decided to give up on medications thinking it would be better for me but I suppose it’s not helping.

Only thing I take psychiatry wise is adderall and it’s helped me more than any other medication in the past.

I’ve seen probably over10 or 20 psychiatrists in my life trying to find something to help me so I have various diagnoses. I will put them in two categories.

Ones that follow me around and I think accurately describe what I’m going through: PTSD, adhd, ASD, GAD, and depression.

Ones that were only diagnosed once by various psychiatrists (after talking to the psychiatrist for the first time for fifteen minutes while reading down a checklist, also worth noting they had very poor reviews and reputations) and I do not strongly identify with: OCD, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder

Although my depression is the source of my suicidal ideations and prevents me from feeling joy or happiness, anxiety probably affects me more in the day to day from the perspective of others.

Abilify, prozac, oxcarbazepine, seroquel, strattera, buspar, Wellbutrin, luvox",1

"Back in May of last year, I started taking Buspar for my anxiety/ depression. Buspar worked great except for making me bloat like crazy. In December, I switched to Lexapro (what my mom takes). Lexapro was amazing for my anxiety/ depression but made me gain 20 lbs within just a few months and severely lowered my libido. I started Wellbutrin earlier this month; my libido as well as my anxiety has come back. I just want the tiniest dose of an anxiety medication to pair with Wellbutrin to take the edge off. Something that won’t make me gain crazy weight, make me bloated 24/7 or kill my sex drive. Has anyone found anything that works for them? ",1
"I need help. I don't know who to turn to, what kind of doctors I can speak with, and what I should do about my medication to get my sex drive back.

I was fine all my life. Horny af even. No problem getting wet and aroused enough for sex to feel great.

But then I take Effexor for three (3!!!) months and I suddenly feel like I'm ASEXUAL or going through fucking menopause. Low to nonexistent libido. Dryer than the Sahara. I might rarely have a sexual dream, or some kind of sexual undertones, or randomly be slightly turned on. But it's not as often, or as strong, it's always random and goes away just as quickly as it came on. I don't have the desire or urge to initiate anything sexual or intimate with my boyfriend, other than like holding hands or kissing. I mean it's bad. He's so patient with me, but I feel so guilty, embarrassed, and less confident because I just know other girls my age don't have this problem and would gladly please him more than I can

I've gotten my hormones checked out. I've gotten advice from my primary care doctor to use lube or coconut oil. I've started Wellbutrin. I've talked to my gynecologist and switched around my birth controls.

My therapist who suggested Effexor refused to believe it was the medication that started this. The hormone doctor got my results back and wasn't concerned about anything. The advice from my primary care doctor doesn't help solve the issue (and lube isn't as satisfying as natural arousal--it still makes sex feel irritating and unpleasant). The different birth controls don't help; going off birth control slightly helped my libido but not the wetness, and I had to go back on it anyway because I don't want to get pregnant.

I feel like I'm at a loss. My bf wants me to talk to a doctor again, but WHO??? A sex therapist? A different hormone doctor, or a different gyno?

I'm still on Wellbutrin and Buspar. Should I stop either them? If so, how do I safely come off Wellbutrin?

I'm beyond frustrated, and I genuinely wish I could sue Effexor or something. I know my anxiety might be partially getting in the way of being aroused, but the dryness and the lack of any sexual desire is not anxiety alone; it seems more serious. As a 25 year old, I feel really embarrassed and sad about this and I feel like doctors don't take it seriously that a young adult should not be having these issues",1

In the last 4-5 months, my anxiety has been absolutely through the roof. Extremely visceral reactions to things that would previously only mildly bother me, actually losing sleep frequently due to fear. I am having to take 2-3 hydroxyzine pills a day.

i know there’s some sort of adjustment period to taking them which is why the first couple days i just charged my severe nausea to the game. the third time i took them, i got extremely nauseous, dizzy and lightheaded, and my eyes felt like they were tingling. i felt like i would throw up. that time i took them without food because i thought i would be able to eat at work but couldnt that day. the fourth time, i took them about an hour after eating to see if it would help but it didnt. i took them around 4 pm and felt incredibly nauseous the entire rest of the day to the point where i couldnt eat again because everything sounded nasty and thinking of eating anything made me feel like throwing up. 

i had two trulys yesterday with a friend after work after i found a pack of crackers to eat and i felt a little better after eating them, went home and smoked to get rid of the nausea that was coming back and was eventually able to eat a sandwich at like 4 am. i didnt take any today but woke up feeling sick again and after i drank some black tea to try to calm my stomach i vomited, and i STILL feel nauseous. that was about 45 minutes ago and the office is closed. 

i left a voicemail but i just want to make sure i’m not tweaking or anything because i dont think it’s normal anymore and want to stop taking them. it’s only been five days since i picked up my meds and i dont think i can do weeks of this. im sorry the post is so long i just didnt want to leave out any details in case there was something important i did wrong. i don’t know if it’s an interaction with me smoking and drinking because i used to do that in excess before when i was taking them and never had any issues. thank you in advance for any answers",1
"Hi all, I 26m am looking for experiences and recommendations for social anxiety medication. I’ve been wanting to avoid it but I am tired of always being anxious. To give some additional info I have tried many of the more common SSRI’s (Lexapro,Prozac,Etc) but most either did nothing for my anxiety or gave me genital numbness which is a deal breaker for me. Does anyone have good luck with Viibryd and minimal sexual side effects ? Has Wellbutrin or any other antidepressant/anxiolytic work for you ? I tried Buspar in the past but if gave me this strange feeling in my head so I stopped it. I am starting to feel hopeless and just want some sort of relief. I tried propranolol and that is great for the physical but not the mental side of things. ",1
So quick backstory I’ve been on basically every ssri and snri along with Klonopin and other pills like buspar but for about 6-7 years now my body has taken 2mg of kpins everyday. So last week hit the 4 MONTH not week mark of prozac 20mg fail and I just stopped and I felt brain fog but nothing crazy now today 4 I wake up to my brain getting zapped and the bigger thing I can’t remember little things is this a side effect from stopping the Prozac or could the klonopin be catching up that fast and be so prevalent ,1

Oh yeah. Fuck hydroxyzine (for me.) All it did was give me terrible medicine head and made my anxiety worse because of it. Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine (which I didn't know at the time) and I might be sensitive to it because all I felt was like I took a handful of Benadryl and then tried to stay awake and be productive. It was awful.,1
"Unfortunately buspar gave me SI among some other sides and I stopped, only at 10mg/day",1
I see where you’re coming from and I think the bruxism was caused by the Wellbutrin. However that is the only side effect I have from the medications and otherwise they’ve been wonderful,1
"Female, 28, 110lbs, 5'5 
I have anxiety , trichotillomania and pelvic congestion syndrome.

PC Dr I just saw prescribed me to buspar, 5mg twice daily, for GAD, I saw a gyno a week ago for pelvic pain and she gave me cyclobenzaprine for muscle spasms, I don't take it often, but just took my first 5mg of buspar and will take daily as prescribed, I will see my primary in 4 weeks, she knew I was given the muscle relaxer and didnt say anything about mixing them, I told her I have only taken 2 since i got them on the 19th.

I'll keep things succinct here: I donate platelets twice a month.  When they test a sample of my blood there, my platelet count is consistently 250-300 and my hemoglobin is 14-15.  While I've always had intensely heavy menstrual periods, my iron is usually very high.  (Not sure why, as I don't really eat meat.)

Two months ago, I began a very slow titration onto Buspar for anxiety.  A week or so later, I got about 50 feet from the blood bank before my arm began bleeding a lot through the gauze and tight wrap.  Two weeks later, it took 15 minutes of ice, elevation, and compression to stop the bleeding enough to wrap.  Same thing two weeks after that.

The only new thing is the Buspar.  Could that be causing this issue?  I'd hate to quit donating, but it's working pretty well for my anxiety.  Or is this side-effect concerning enough to quit the Buspar?",1

So basically, I was taking hydroxyzine for anxiety and it was doing, well, not much. My doctor switched me to buspar for a month and I gradually built up this almost UTI feeling of urgency and slight burn when urinating. I knew it wasn’t a UTI because I’ve had enough of those to tell the difference.  I realized it was worse for a few hours when I first took a dose then would start to go away then would worsen again with the next dose. My doc took me off of it and I let him know clonopin helped me in the past so we switched to that.  The problem started clearing up, the new-old med is working great again....
Problem is it didn’t FINISH clearing up. It’s not there for a while then I’ll have a moment where I have to pee and I feel that slight pressure/burny feeling or like a feeling like I just can’t finish peeing/can’t empty my bladder and it takes me forever to be able to leave the bathroom comfortably.
Was I wrong? Is it maybe not because of buspar?
Did buspar do something to me?
I’m starting to worry, truly. 
I really hoped this would finish clearing up and maybe it just took a while for it all to leave my system but over a month...that’s not logical with the half life of buspirone...",1
"I’ve recently been asked to switch off of Lexapro (escitalopram) and start taking Buspar (buspirone).  I’ve cut from 20mg to 10mg over a month, then 5mg for a week as my Doc prescribed, then on to the Buspar once a day.

I have been taking Buspar for a week now.  

I know I am having Lexapro withdrawal — those weird floaty shitty feelings and anxiety, almost a vibrating, weird whispy feeling — it’s been about 6 days since Lexapro.  I’m quite frankly fucking pissy; short with my loved ones, and I keep apologizing, but I don’t want to feel like this.  Is this going to level out?  

This totally fucking blows.",1
"I'll include medical history below, as I think it's less relevant. The short of it is I've had terrible anxiety problems and lowered mental performance. My doc wants me to try Prozac. I did the reading and it seems to me that Prozac is the best of a dangerous class of drugs. It helps around 50% of people and causes truly awful side effects and or long-term withdrawal symptoms in almost as many people as it helps.

I read up on everything I could find and it seemed to me that Burspar was more likely to be effective for anxiety. It seems to help most people, doesn't leave you drowsy, has few serious side effects, and it's dirty cheap. I don't understand why it isn't more popular. What am I missing? Also all the reading says that one of its chief advantages is low/absent addiction potential, but my primary said ""We don't proscribe that. Only psychiatrists do in very serious cases. It's too dangerous and habit forming."" What gives?

Since the subreddit asks for it, here's a fuller medical history:

35y. Male. 150bs. 5'10"". Caucasian. In the US.

I've always had issues with anxiety, and though it was never diagnosed I'd say I'm somewhere on the high-functioning side of the autism spectrum and had bad issues with ADD as a child probably continuing on through adulthood. 

I worked at a startup for seven years in my mid twenties, often putting in 70 hour weeks and travelling about 50% of the time. This really wrecked me. I started having awful insomnia, heart palpitations and very high heart rate, and then started having panic attacks.

I've tried to reduce stress since then. Generally I stick to a forty hour work week, jog for a half hour every day, don't drink much and try to eat well. Still I'm more and more anxious, occasionally depressive, and I frequently become very forgetful and have great difficulties concentrating. This is extra troubling as I work a very cognitively demanding job.

I've been reading a little about CBT, but I can't really talk to a pro right now as I made a poor choice insurance wise this year.

Medication wise I've found benadryl to be helpful sometimes during a panic attack, and I take ashwagandha which I *think* is helpful, but not dramatically so. I don't want to take benadryl all the time because it drains me if I take enough for it to be helpful, and it also really raises the risk of Parkinson's and dementia.

"For years I used to do sinus rinses daily, had freq sinus infections, I had distilled water jugs on standby, etc. 


Now post op for years my symptoms are much better, & I only rinse when I'm feeling congested or have a cold. Maybe 1-2/month at most. I'm on city water. 


Tl;Dr is: I'm lazy and don't feel like using distilled water bc I either don't have it on hand, or I have to microwave it to make it a comfortable temp, but I can use warm water from the tap just fine. I've done this over the past 2 years with no problems, but I'm wondering, am I playing Russian roulette with my sinuses? 


I'm not asking if buying purified water for this is better, bc ofc it is, but like what are the chances I'm gonna get a brain eating amoeba? Extremely high, extremely low? 


If there's a place I can look up water quality reports for my municipality, I could try that, not sure if it would provide relevant info.

Hi everyone,  

I’m a 26-year-old female diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and OCD, both of which I’ve dealt with since childhood. My anxiety was severe as a child, requiring significant intervention. I’m sharing my situation here to get advice and organize my thoughts.  

Here’s a brief timeline:  

- **August 2024:** Went cold turkey off Prozac (I know this was a mistake).  
- **September 2024:** Restarted Prozac when my OCD worsened.  
- **October 2024:** Experienced two of the worst panic attacks in my life, with intense fear of death and existence.  

By **October 23rd**, things escalated:  
- Lost my appetite.  
- Developed neurological symptoms: **severe muscle weakness, twitching, and a strange rumbling sensation in my arms and legs.**  
- Progressed to debilitating fatigue—I used to run a mile in 10 minutes, but now I can’t walk a mile without being drenched in sweat, heart rate reaching 160, shortness of breath, and crushing chest pains.  
- **Joint and muscle pain has become unbearable**, especially in my left arm, neck, shoulders, and back. It’s not just stiffness—it feels like a deep, nauseating pain that makes even basic movement difficult.  

**Other symptoms:**  
- **Pressure:** Feels like weights are pressing on my body, worst when sitting or walking, slightly relieved when bending over or swaying side to side.  
- **Twitching/Vibrations:** My body twitches at night, and it feels like vibrations are causing me to flinch.  
- **Jaw issues:** Chronic TMJ, jaw locks, severe pain, hard to chew. I recently got a crown and wonder if it’s related.  
- **Other:** Pins and needles, extreme stiffness, brain fog, sound sensitivity, heart rate spikes (140+ when walking), and legs that feel like jello.  

**Medications I’m currently on:**  
- **Prozac**: 40mg daily.  
- **Buspar**: 5mg twice daily.  
- **Ativan**: 0.5mg as needed for sleep and panic attacks.  
- Doctors recently prescribed **Gabapentin**, but the side effects were too intense for me to continue taking it.  

**Support system:**  
I have a great psych team, including a psychologist I meet with twice a week who successfully helped me out of a bad episode four years ago. This is the worst relapse I’ve had since then.  

**Life context:**  
I have a good (but stressful) job in social services, which I enjoy. Recently, I was dealing with marriage issues, which may have worsened my symptoms.  

**Important context:**  
- I had a mild case of mononucleosis in August (fatigue and lost voice for two weeks, but fully recovered). Could this be related?  
- I’m terrified this could be myocarditis, MS, or something else serious.  

**Tests so far:**  
- 4 EKGs (sinus tachycardia attributed to anxiety, 160 bpm at peak).  
- 2 chest X-rays.  
- 3 CBC counts, 3 metabolic panels, troponin levels (clean). My neutrophils and platelets are consistently a bit high, which doctors have always attributed to stress.  
- On my most recent ER visit, **monocytes and other inflammatory/infection markers were elevated**, but doctors dismissed it as anxiety and said everything is normal.  
- CRP (normal).  
- Head CT (no contrast) and MRI of brain and cervical spine (clean per doctor’s call, awaiting full results). I was almost hoping the MRI would show something with my spine just so I could have some kind of explanation for all these symptoms.

I’m scared, confused, and overwhelmed. I don’t want to keep visiting the ER and specialists, especially since I can’t afford it and feel bad taking up resources.  

Could these symptoms be lingering effects of mono? Anxiety-related? Something else entirely? Any insight or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!  ",1
"35F Diagnosed with chronic migraines, IBS, IC, asthma, endometriosis, OCD, and depression. I take Viibryd, Buspar, Propranolol, Omezpradole, Singulair, and Claritin daily. Newest medications include Nurtec (every other day preventatively) and Klonopin .25mg twice a day as needed. 

This is kind of a long one but I’m DESPERATE for help. I posted about this last week before going to my PCP, but I didn’t get a real response so I wanted to get a second opinion on here.

For almost two weeks, I’ve had severe vision issues that seemed to start after a migraine on Monday, October 14th. The migraine itself passed fairly quickly, but the eye issues have stuck around. I have severe sensitivity to light, blurred/hazy vision, pressure behind my eye, and overall distorted vision. In addition, I was experiencing very high blood pressure (160/105) and pulse for hours. I also was dealing with pretty severe nausea surrounding lights. 

I went to the doctor this Monday. She did an EKG and determined that my heart was fine, and that my increased blood pressure and pulse were likely to due to my anxiety, nausea, and pain around my migraine (although I explained to her that the migraine pain was minimal). She gave me 8mg Zofran, a shot of toradol, and a prescription to begin Nurtec every other day for preventation of further migraines. I saw no improvement, except in my nausea which returned almost 8 hours later on the spot. 

I had horrible panic attacks the following night because I was not getting any relief and had no clue what was going on. So, I scheduled a crisis screening to get on something for my anxiety to help me through this. My doctor prescribed me 1/2 to 1 tab of 0.5mg klonopin to take twice daily as needed. I’ve only taken 1/2 tab when I’ve been on the verge of a panic attack (so maybe 4 times since prescribed). 

I started taking the Nurtec. It seemed to knock whatever the remaining migraine was that was left, but the eye issues still remain the same. The only symptom that eased up was the pressure behind my eye. 

My vision feels completely distorted. I am having flashes of light randomly in dark spaces (kind of like a strobe light), blurred/hazy vision, extreme light sensitivity, and almost like there may be a smudge on my glasses but no matter how much I clean them it’s still there. 

This evening, I noticed one of my eye lids looked maybe swollen or droopy. My husband noticed it too. It is the eye on the side that I’ve been having the migraine and most of these symptoms on. I’m not noticing any other symptoms of stroke, so I don’t believe it would be that. So, I’m kind of at a loss. 

I was at the eye doctor in July and had no vision changes there. The PCP made me a referral to a neurologist, but I’ve still not heard back on when that is scheduled for. Of course the swollen eye happened on the weekend when no optometrist office is open. So, here I am on Reddit begging for reassurance this can wait until Monday or if it is something I should seek emergency care for. 

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",1

Hello, r/Askdocs, I recently had a second PCNL done on my left kidney to remove the other staghorn.       


The PCNL went by flawlessly, it wasn’t until I did a lithotripsy a few days later to get the remainder of the stones in the top part of the kidney that the doctor couldn’t reach, that I started experiencing negative side effects.          

Right now, I’ve been discharged from the hospital and I’ve been home for four days, I was doing just fine, and now all of a sudden, I’m having a lot of pain in my left kidney, alongside the fact that I am urinating very heavy blood clots.           

I’m talking it looks like ketchup that you’re putting on french fries and it’s been happening three or four times already. Making it hard to urinate.         

Also, when I got the lithotripsy done, I was only told that an infection or blood loss could happen, but I was never notified that it could lead to hypertension or diabetes.             

I was already prediabetic, but then, thankfully, due to diet and exercise, I managed to get rid of it, but I noticed immediately after getting the lithotripsy my systolic blood pressure went from 104 after the PCNL, to a whopping 126.            

Now normally it is around 120 or 130, but I always presumed it was due to the fact that I had the staghorns. Because right after the first staghorn was removed from my right kidney, my blood pressure went down tremendously from an average of 160/110, to 138/86.               

After the second one was removed, before any additional surgeries, I was regularly testing at 104/60. But as soon as I had the lithotripsy done, my blood pressure shot back up to 126/85.

So now I’m worried I may develop diabetes as well. 

What’s the literature currently out there, what are my next steps? To get some more bloodwork done to verify my glucose levels haven’t gone up tremendously?           

(Update I am back in the ER to get things looked at, CT scan was done to verify no blockage is present, but I’d still like to know the likelihood of me developing permanent problems because of the lithotripsy)",1
"demographic info: 32F, 5'2 130lbs, white/jewish 

For the last few years I've been completely falling apart for reasons that no one is really able to explain. I have a history of PTSD that I treated with therapy and consider it to have ""downgraded"" to situational anxiety. A few years ago I had a bad breakup and around the same time had a bad URI (RAT negative for covid) with a painful dry cough that lasted for months. After that I started feeling very weird - low energy, malaise, sense of impending doom, and assumed I was feeling depressed from the breakup. But then I started noticing that whenever I was standing, my HR would shoot up to 110-130 bpm and stay there. My GP did several ""poor man's"" POTS tests and my HR did increase by a lot when I stood up, but they didn't find anything with a tilt table test. Cardiology started me on midodrine anyway which helped, but for years I've had chronic feelings of tiredness and anxiety, and have fainted a couple of times. Last year I went through a period of intense stress, and began experiencing very intense physical anxiety and insomnia. I trialed several psych meds but they all made my heart race, gave me chest pain, or made me feel extremely anxious and agitated. I finally ended up taking 5mg lexapro a day, a very low dose, for a few months. I didn't think it helped very much and it caused me profound sexual side effects so I stopped it. During this period I also developed severe, painful bloating and abdominal distention which fueled the anxiety a lot, and things felt very unmanageable after stopping the lexapro. Finally I ended up where I am now which is taking 20mg of buspar a day (the max dose I can tolerate without getting paresthesias) which helps a lot with the anxiety, but is causing similar sexual side effects (these are definitely caused by the drug and not by stress, I can explain more in the comments if requested). Meanwhile my stomach is getting worse all the time. I've had a clean EGD, no C. diff or H. pylori, negative SIBO test, but X-ray showed a severe stool burden and anorectal manometry indicated pelvic floor dysfunction. My GI put me on linzess which didn't help the bloating but gave me diarrhea. I'm now also taking xifaxan and neomycin. I don't know if it's in my head but since starting the course, I've had increased anxiety and insomnia, a lot of nausea, and horrible diarrhea. I think the stress and dehydration is flaring up the orthostatic symptoms and I'm a total wreck - yesterday could hardly get up without feeling dizzy and was not able to cook or do any work or chores. So all in all I'm experiencing fatigue, lightheadedness, bloating, diarrhea, anxiety, and the icing on the cake is genital anesthesia/pleasureless orgasm. 

So here's my question: what is happening to my body and what the f do I DO? Primary care thinks everything is anxiety and I'm trying to cooperate with my psychiatrist but I've tried every class of drug there is and I feel a lot of stress and sadness over the sexual side effects. GI thinks I have slow gut motility and a bowel but the meds they are giving me and pelvic floor PT aren't helping. Psychotherapy is not helping. Cardiology thinks I have a ""POTS-like syndrome"" but doesn't have many recommendations except to push salt and fluids, which just makes the bloating worse. Is this all just anxiety? If so I don't know what to do because I've tried so many meds, therapy, the DARE program, meditation, yoga, etc. I exercise and take good care of myself. The anxiety rarely feels cognitive (not worrying excessively or afraid of specific outcomes or situations), I just feel vaguely on edge and uncomfortable and like something is wrong with my body. I don't think I've felt normal for a single day since I got that infection 3 years ago. Things have gotten so much worse this year and I have no idea where to go from here.

I am constantly experiencing some level of pain in my joints, but some days it is so bad i can’t concentrate in my college classes. the only thing that provides momentary relief is cracking my joints, but the pain returns within a few minutes. my whole spine hurts 24/7 and my shoulders, fingers, knees, ankles, and elbows vary in pain. i have a lifelong history of repeated ankle sprains. i also experience frequent lightheadedness and chronic fatigue. i get frequent headaches and have a consistently high heart rate. it is worth noting that i am quite obese (i’m working on it, i have a history of an eating disorder) i am diagnosed with autism, adhd, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, ptsd, pcos, and asthma. i take prozac, elavil, buspar, prazosin, adderall, claritin, and oral contraceptives. there is no chance that i am pregnant and i have noticed no relation between my pain and my menstrual cycle. i also have not noticed a correlation between my mental health and my pain levels (but if any docs think it still could be psychosomatic, i’m open to the possibility). i’ve had EDS suggested by peers with the disorder. I meet a lot of the typical hyper mobility criteria, but I don’t have stretchy skin and I have never, to my knowledge, dislocated anything. Does anyone have any ideas about what could be happening?

Health:
Worsening anxiety, med resistant insomnia, recent diagnosed ADHD, low vit D. Massive weight loss in the past 3 years due to gastric sleeve (250lbs in 1 year). PCOS with active cysts. Prior relevant health info is periods were so bad and symptomatic that it was causing severe anemia as a teen. I have not had mental health so bad since I was a teen.

Mirena #2 was placed March 2020 at my heaviest weight (420lbs). Have had Mirenas since 2015 after turning 20 and not having success with BC pills for numerous reasons. Since 2015 my acne and mental health have improved drastically. 

Note: upon Mirena #1's replacement in 2020, I never had breakthrough bleeding. I am unsure if this had to do with my weight or the IUD.


Today:

My mental health is at its worst in 15 years. I started BC pills 15 years ago for periods as a teen, then switched to Mirena IUD after 6 years of pills. Currently, my life is great, but my anxiety and panic disorder is affecting my life so badly. I DO NOT have a source of stress I can link this to. It is literally seemingly happening for no other reason except chemical imbalances. My insomnia does not respond to Hydroxyzine, Benadryl, melatonin, Trazodone, doxylamine succinate, etc. I've tried different (safe) combos of melatonin + Benadryl, etc. I cannot sleep more than 3 hours at once. It has been worsening since February 2024. My overall health is suffering.


I've had breakthrough bleeding since 2.5 years of current Mirena. My OB did not seem to remember that I was using the IUD not for BC but for hormonal control. At the beginning of current IUD, I had no periods. I rapidly lost weight, still no periods for a year after weight loss, then they returned Oct 2022. They are progressively getting worse and worse - more blood, pain, worsening PMS symptoms (mood, acne, water retention) to the point it's like I do not even have an IUD. My periods are close to being what they were before I EVER had an IUD as far as pain and symptoms.


The only difference is that I am not bleeding as much as I was as a teen, but enough for my OB to prescribe a one-off additional BC pill to get my anemia under control as I was bleeding so much that it was jeopardizing my hemoglobin for a surgery that I needed. So - enough to need some medication intervention but not blood transfusions yet.


I've since run out of supplemental BC as that was a year ago. My OB says my insurance likely won't cover an early replacement despite all my symptoms and it only being 6 months earlier than recommended for control on hormonal issues. I do have medical records since Oct 2022 to support the fact that I've had bleeding return.


My IUD has been checked several times and while it has shifted downwards, it's still believed to be effective for pregnancy (not my concern), I am unsure if this shift has affected its efficacy for my hormones.


I have not had hormonal labwork drawn yet despite me asking. I am unsure what I would need drawn. I am more than willing to order tests on myself if I can have some advice on what to order, and take it back to my doctor.


My questions:

1. Is there any studied correlation between hormonal issues in women, weakened BC options, and mental health? I truly believe my weakening IUD is contributing to some of my uncontrolled anxiety. I'd love to take something to my doctor to get this moving faster. 

/
2. Is there a way I can get insurance to cover an earlier-than-normal (which is 5 years) IUD replacement? I am bleeding through tampons despite having a Mirena, severe debilitating cramps - it is like I don't have an IUD at all (placement was checked 1 month ago). I have several doctor visits for my insomnia, bleeding, mental health issues across 3 providers to support symptom documentation.

/
3. If my current OB is unwilling to change my IUD (they gave me pushback when I reminded them they told me my IUD was only for 5 years not 7 because I am not using it for pregnancy), is it possible to get a new OB who will be willing to change it + work with insurance, or do I need a history with a doctor in general? Meaning - I am scheduled to have my Mirena replaced in 6 months, but I really don't know if I can handle another 6 months (3 years total) of misery and life disrupting symptoms. However, if I'd have to go through another few months working with a new doctor, I may just keep my current one just to get my Mirena replaced ""on time"".

/
Bonus: is there anything out there related to rapid weightloss in women and efficacy of hormonal IUDs? My GP is convinced that a lot of my current health issues are cascading effects from my very rapid weightloss (250 lbs in a year was not an exaggeration). I am trying to build a case that I need this thing replaced soon not only for my physical, documented health (cysts, worsening anemia, pain) as well as my mental health (which is my main concern currently).",1
"Hello, thanks for your time and consideration reading my post. I'm a 37M living in the US. I am 5'9"" and roughly 320lbs. I'll first list my diagnoses and medicines to get the necessary information out of the way and then go into my concerns.

Diagnoses:

* MS (relapsing remitting)
* IBS (mixed)
* On and off costochondritis
* History of gastric ulcer
* GERD
* Depression and Anxiety (mostly health related)
* Morbid obesity
* Mild iron deficiency

  
Medications:

* Glatiramer Acetate (40mg 3x weekly MFW)
* Venlafaxine (75mg daily)
* Modafinil (200mg daily)
* Pantoprazole (40mg daily)
* Lisinopril (2.5mg daily)
* Buspar (20mg twice daily, RECENTLY STOPPED following discussion with psychiatrist)
* Cranberry supplement (1x daily)
* Iron Supplement (65mg 1x daily)
* B12 Supplement (1x daily)



In 2014 I was diagnosed with MS (relapsing remitting). I didn't start taking medication until 2020 when I started on a 3x weekly (MWF) glatiramer acetate injection. I tolerated it well and I have a yearly MRI and follow up with my neurologist. At our last visit in February he mentioned a new small lesion in my brain but also noted that I have very low disease activity otherwise (maximum 1 new lesion per year, sometimes a couple years apart, and all non-enhancing and no previous lesions worsening, some in fact shrinking).

Since my diagnosis I have struggled with depression and anxiety (despite the low disease activity) out of all sorts of uncertain outcomes. I've been through talk therapy and behavioral therapy and have been on medications for these concerns. I have recently started seeing an actual psychiatrist rather than getting my mental health meds directly through my GP so that I could get more specialized care. When I started seeing her (March of this year) I was on 60mg Duloxetine and 20mg twice daily of Buspar, but recently switched to Venlafaxine and dropped the Buspar as a trial to see how I feel. I had been experiencing some significant brain fog and was wondering if it might be attributed to the high dosage of Buspar. She thought it wouldn't hurt to try and that I could just get back on it if I noticed a spike in anxiety. This was last month (09/2024).

About June of last year (2023), I was having chest pains that were making me extremely anxious. I noticed I was feeling a little bit more cold than usual. I also noticed I was feeling a little more sick, as if I was about to come down with something, and then nothing every happened. This persisted for a while so I reached out to my GP and she had labs drawn on a number of things. My CBC at the time showed my MCH was slightly low (27.7pg), which they were largely unconcerned with as everything else was normal but did an iron panel regardless which showed my iron was a little low (Iron 50 ug/dL) as well as my Transferrin Saturation % (14%). There were no dietary changes at the time, and there was a thought that possibly the Pantoprazole at the time was inhibiting some iron absorption (at this time I was on 80mg, 40mg twice daily for about 2 years post-ulcer). They had me start an iron supplement (65mg daily) which I still take as I have not been instructed not to. I also met with my GI and we reduced my Pantoprazole to 40mg once daily. Along with CBC my GP ran Vitamin D panel, CRP, ESR, and ANA Reflex, all came back normal. This was all within July and August of 2023.

Around this time I had also been experiencing some chest and rib pain similar to something I had experienced in the past and was diagnosed as costochondritis, thought this time was presenting with back pain as well. I had Xrays done for this in 2019, a CT done in 2021 and then now they ordered MRI of my thoracic spine and CT of my chest. There was nothing notable on these images and it was again diagnosed as costochondritis. 

In October I contracted Covid for the first time, which hit pretty hard and afterwards I was having some wild vertigo type symptoms where I would feel unsteady moving my eyes side to side. I went to urgent care as my GP was booked out pretty far and they put me on an antibiotic and a short course of prednisone and it receded pretty quickly. I would randomly get little bouts of this same thing here and there over the next couple months, but usually only a day or two and they were few and far between. Sort of just chalked this up to sleeping weird or my MS messing with my balance or inner ears.

From October to December I would still experience the same sort of coldness and on-the-verge-of-sick feeling from time to time. Some days it would come more towards the evening, sometimes I would feel it all day, some days not at all. And some days I wouldn't feel both at the same time, just one.

In December my GP wanted to do follow up labs to see what my iron levels were at following the iron supplement. My WBC count was slightly elevated to 11.1 10e3/uL and my Auto Absolute Lymphcytes and Monocytes were elevated as well (4.1 and 1.3 10e3/uL respectively). My MCH returned to normal range (but lower end) at 28.7pg and my Iron and Transferrin Iron % also stabilized but also lower end of normal (79 ug/dL and 23% respectively). After my initial iron drops and then seeing my elevated WBCs in addition to my symptoms I was feeling at the time I began spiraling thinking about leukemia or lymphoma or something of the sort, but my doctors all told me they were nothing to worry about and that I was probably fighting off infection of some kind.

Fast forward to March of this year (2024), I was still feeling some pretty significant anxiety and also continued back pain and the coldness (I would alternate between cold and hot and historically just ran hot usually) and general verge-of-sickness malaise still persisted. I reached back out to my GP, She did more labs and this time everything was within normal range (aside from very slightly elevated Creatinine which was short lived and likely due to dehydration). WBC was back to 9.8 10e3/uL which was pretty historically normal for me, and MCH was up to 29.3pg. Iron was up to 127 ug/dL and Transferrin Saturation % was up to 38%. I had some imaging of my lower back done, where they found two mildly dessicated discs in my lower spine which I went to PT and ortho for as well as some short runs of pain meds.

At this point she had mostly said the sensations I was feeling were likely fatigue and nerve sensations due to MS disease activity and we sort of left it there. I spoke with my neurologist again after our yearly visit to bring up the symptoms again with him and he ultimately said the same thing. I stressed my concerns about something like lymphoma due to my history with EBV and mono as a kid and he said that after looking at my recent imaging my lymph nodes all looked fine and that it was also likely MS symptoms.

Shortly after my visit with my  GP I began having significant side pain that was more in my abdomen than my back and so I went to urgent care. They took some abdominal xrays and showed some signs of stool blockage and did more labs as I explained my current possible MS symptoms that I was experiencing and unsure about their relation to anything. They ran liver and pancreas labs, basic metabolic panel, and a urine test, all normal. I was given the all clear and sent home with a plan to clear my mild blockage and revisit with my GP if needed.

In August of this year (2024) I had a significant panic attack. I was having chest pain again and this time it felt like I was also having trouble breathing and it slowly but surely spiraled into a panic attack which I have only really had explicitly once before. I reluctantly went to the ER and they ran a number of tests and Xrays related to my heart and everything came back normal, however my CBC Differential came back with an elevated WBC of 14.2 10e3/uL and elevated Auto Absolute Neutrophil and Monocytes (9.2 10e3/uL and 1.6 10e3/uL respectively). My Auto Absolute Lymphocyte was also on the high end of normal at 3 10e3/uL. They again expressed that it could likely be to fighting off an infection, stress, anxiety, etc., and that it was nothing to worry about.

Well, challenge accepted because i continued to worry about it until this week where it was really starting to boil over and I contacted my GP about my concerns regarding my elevated WBC labs over the last year and the continued verge-of-sickness malaise and wacky body temperature issues. She again expressed little concern but wanted to run the labs again and run a peripheral smear just to put my mind at ease. Today we ran the tests again (10/3/2024) and my WBC was again slightly elevated though lower at 11.7 10e3/uL, with only my Auto Absolute Neutrophil showing a slight elevation (also lower than previous) at 7.6 10e3/uL.

When she ordered the labs she said it would be a CBC Differential and a peripheral smear. However when I went to the lab, they said they only had a CBC differential ordered and when I asked about the smear they said it was probably part of it. But I have yet to get any results for a smear or any indication that one is happening. I messaged my GP about it but haven't heard anything.

At the end of the day, I have been sick with worry over what my wacky CBCs could mean. I've seen everything from leukemia to lymphoma, and I've been particularly anxious about the prospect of lymphoma given my medical history. I just wish I felt better. I've gained a lot of weight in the last year because I feel so run down and depressed and anxious. I've beaten myself up over my labs and spent countless nights worrying about these results, what it could mean, what's being missed, and what I could be doing to make sure it's not something worse than just my MS as many have suggested it to be. It's just so new as a symptom for me (within the last year, never really experienced this prior) and it's also such vague feelings that I don't ever really see much as far as similar symptoms with MS patients.

Which brings me to the difficulties of my journey: what is MS and what isn't? Is my MS diagnose or my intense anxiety solely to blame? Or are these diagnoses clouding the waters and making it more difficult to diagnose something else? It's hard for me to know what is and isn't something to worry about and what is ""just my MS"", I worry so much lately that I wonder if that's what's elevating my labs and also causing my MS to flare. It's hard to feel certain especially when it feels like there are no definitive answers.

  
I apologize for the lengthy post, I wanted to make sure all my bases were covered and that I got this as fully descriptive and informational as I can make it.

"I 18f have been diagnosed with hypermobile ehlers danlos syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, including delayed gastric emptying but not gastroparesis. I have a history of mental disorders and was born addicted to cocaine. My diagnosis are yet to be figured out but I have been certainly diagnosed with ASD L1, ADHD unspecified/combination, PTSD, and PMDD I’ve had several therapists and due to episodes I’ve experienced I’ve been given these suggestions: 
Borderline personality disorder, Bipolar 1 disorder, Complex post traumatic stress Disorder, and Obsessive compulsive disorder. As I said there’s still a lot of figuring out to do because the mental hospital messed up my diagnosis quite a bit. I’ve been medicated for several years starting with Lexapro 10mg, adding Lamictal 100mg after Lexapro caused a medication induced manic episode. We tried Abilify which caused a psychotic episode. We tried Latuda which caused hormone changes. We tried several birth controls (almost every one available with my insurance) and they all made my PMDD significantly worse. I inevitably had a Skyla IUD implanted, which has been perfectly fine for two years. Currently they switched my medication a lot, I take the following: 

Buspar 10mg 2x per/day AM
Effexor 150mg 1x per/day AM
Stratera 40mg 1x per/day AM
Lamictal 100mg 1x per/day AM
Prazosin 6mg 1x per/day PM
Cyproheptadine 4mg 2x per/day AM/PM
Xanax PRN rarely used (Once a month at most) 

As for my physical health I developed an unspecified tic disorder in 2020 when my poTs started. The first tic attack was after having my first shot of alchohol with some friends. It then woild happen randomly from sneezing, coldness, anxiety, excitement, or any substance use. I should include I use medical marajuana daily in the form of vaporizing soleventless concentrates as that was the recommended form by my doctors after RSO did not work for me. My poTs symptoms increased to what we believe to be hyperadrenergic in 2021, at this point I was only on Lexapro and Lamictal, and a birth control called tri- sprintec. I had no IUD. I have episodes of extreme sweating, nausea, vomiting, shaking, irregular and fast heartbeat, palpitations, chest pain, impending sense of doom, high blood pressure, and when the episodes become bad enough, non- epileptic seizures from stress on my body. This has become similar to muscle twitching I’m experiencing. I’ve had shaky hands since my poTs started in 2020, and I’m used to the feeling of tics, but this is much different. It’s more of a jolting muscle twitch, similar to what you see in the beginning stages of ALS (this is just the most accurate comparison I’ve seen, I do not believe I have ALS). They are similar to my tics, but I do not have a premonitory urge at all. It’s completely random, uncontrollable, and often startling. I can no longer write properly, do my makeup, or anything that takes precision. It is the worst when I’m focused and trying to make small movements. It also increases from stress. I recently had an MRI and my results became almost completely skewed. Most of the twitching is in my arms, shoulders, and chest. It also happens in my legs when I lay down or try to focus on relaxing. I’ve also recently started to experience severe migraines. It will feel like I’m being smacked in the back of my head with a frying pan, typically after some sort of movement like standing up or jerking my head to the side. It will last 2+ hours, including light and sound sensitivity, and once with aura. I’m not looking for a specific answer as I know from experience symptoms can mean many things, but is there a direction someone can point me in? ",1
"This is going to be long so sorry in advance but I'm at a roadblock and need some help. So around mid march of this year I went to an NHL game but the whole time I couldn't enjoy myself because I was vomiting almost any chance I could it felt like. After all was said and done I probably vomited around 4-6 times. I wasn't sick or anything of the sort so I assumed it was just anxiety.

Ever since March I haven't been the same. For weeks after, I would wake up in the mornings and feel violently nauseous and in most cases would vomit at least once a day. My memory is very foggy, but around April or May I still was just constantly nauseous, gagging and belching over toilets, and vomiting.

So I finally see my PCP who is a nurse practitioner, and she felt it was just anxiety which I agreed with. I had already been on lexapro in the past and didn't like it so I got put on Pristiq and got a prescription for dissolvable zofran. Long story short it felt like it was working until it really wasn't because I was still nauseous and vomiting.

Since those things weren't helping my PCP ordered I get an ultrasound of my abdomen early June and they didn't find anything concerning or out of the ordinary. June was particularly rough at moments as it was my birthday and I also had a trip that month. During the trip I felt horrible, to the point where I felt like I genuinely had a stomach bug or something. I pretty much was bed ridden most of the day despite taking as much zofran as I could and always staying on top of my Pristiq doses.

Around the end of July I felt somehow even worse especially mentally and would have uncontrollable crying spells, so I went off the Pristiq. Around this time I also started noticing the zofran just wasn't able to keep up and despite taking it I would vomit. By the end of July my PCP was thinking about prescribing Xanax because we were at a loss of what to do. Instead I was prescribed Buspar and Hydroxyzine as per needed. I also scheduled an appointment with a GI specialist and this is where I'm at currently.

I recently went upstate to visit my boyfriend at his college this past weekend and I threw up once before catching the train and felt super anxious the whole time trying to commute up to him. When I got there I was exhausted but figured some sleep will do me good and I'll be back to normal, but that didn't happen. The first full day I was there I was once again basically bedridden. Mentally I feel fine! I wanted to go up and visit him and the campus so bad, so I didn't and still don't understand why I was bedridden and threw up.

Im still currently prescribed 25mg Hydroxyzine, 10mg twice daily of Buspirone, and (in case this is important) Ive been on Loryna birth control for well over a year almost two now I believe. I use Loryna birth control to skip my menstrual cycle. Please if anyone has ANY advice I could really use it. Im sick of having to hear my PCP say she's at a loss for words every time I come back.

At this point since I've been like this pretty much the entire year I don't even get super nauseous like I used to much anymore but I'm still throwing up. I have slight stomach pain but it more so feels tight almost like it's getting pulled down. My stomach is constantly bubbling whether I'm full or not full. Another point to make is that my stool patterns have changed dramatically. The zofran made me super constipated, but as of recent I've been having some intense diarrhea especially in the early morning.

Im a 20 year old trans man (who's been out to friends since 14 years old) living with my parents. I have no other existing health problems, and have been to multiple therapists. I have smoked marijuana and most times it makes it somewhat better but as of right now I haven't in over a week. Nothing I try seems to work and I would appreciate if anyone has any help, experience, or advice. Especially because I start Phlebotomy classes soon. Thank you for reading this.",1

.........

Hello! I greatly (greatly) apologize in advance for the length of this, but if any doctors on here (or patients with similar experiences) have the time to read this, I would so appreciate any thoughts, insights, recommendations, or opinions on any of this.

Basically my health has been in shambles since this all ramped up over the last couple of years, and I've currently used up all of my current short term disability and am on week 3 of waiting to hear about my long term disability claim (through my employer).

They will terminate me after a certain amount of weeks on LTD, and my PCP suggested talking to Berger and Green to consider govenment disabiliy.

I'm a passionate environmental consultant and trying to hang onto my career by a thread, but I'm not reliable enough for my team's needs and can't handle my typical workload anymore (I do task management and project management and have an employee; we have a very high stress, 24/7 job managing 50-60 projects at a time for a high stakes client, interpreting legal regulations and I am solely responsible for some of these projects, and keeping our clients out of trouble (and keeping the environment as protected as possible). It sucks, I used to do fieldwork ALL of the time, which probably contributed to a lot of this (hiking up down the Appalchian mountains every day for years, traveling multiple states every week, night and day work in the woods (bat surveys) carrying heavy equipment on little sleep, lot of tumbles and falls, multiple ER trips for severe exhaustion, BP low, HR high, dizziness, vestibualr issues, and loss of coordination. Got to a piont where I was too much of a liability to my coworker to be out in the mountains (no cell service, 5-6 hours hike back to the truck, and unreliable Garmin in-reach to get a lifeflight). Since I can't do fieldwork, they can't keep me 98% billable, so I've had to become a task manager (basically project manager/assistant PM), but the workload is mentally and cognitively exhausting and I work a lot of evenings and weekends to get work done when projects (always) go haywire.

My boss and team is amazing, but they are not giving me hours anymore even though I can handle some work since I'm fully remote and can work flex time around meetings etc. But I'm pushign it trying to force myself through when I feel terrible and have pain/discomfort all day from my ankle joint, spine, and TMJ. And the recent neurological and cognitivei issues make me almost non-functional a lot of days. Socializing is hard but I finally found friends who for the most part believe me when I tell them the health issues and that I'm suffering and dealing with real issues. I've had other friends and family become a bit dismissive, unbelieving, and tired of me/these issues, understandably. I have a great partner now who's really been here for me thankfully, which has helped tremendously in providing some postivity and comfort/hope.

My financial situation is in shambles and I've had to cash out half of my 401k to afford medical expenses, home adaptations (rolling desk for my couch/bed, massage stuff, supplements, heating pads, etc etc) and to be able to afford rent/food/bills/gas/etc. I have no income coming in, and disability (through my employer) keeps telling me they haven't received the records they need from my doctors still. HR has me in limbo, and I am constantly messaging and calling doctors and the disability insurance company to try to resolve the issues.

(Thanks again in advance for anyone who does read through all of this, and a big, big thank you and appreciation to medical professionals... I'm not sure how it is everywhere else, but doctors and patients are all burning out and overwhelmed here in Pittsburgh, and wait times are 6 months to a year, if at all, for most places).

      * when seizures/neurological episodes happened between May and September 2024, several instances where my resting heart rate shot up to 140s/150s and was sustained for a long time (20, 30 minutes, with additional waves of it?); severe chest pain and tightness; severe burning in arms and limbs
      * past radiology has picked up on:
   * Ankle (right ankle)
      * chronic peroneal subluxation
      * had five foot and ankle surgies
   * Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
      * Diagnosed by a geneticst two years ago after no clear answers or diagnoses from other doctors, and mostly ""normal""-ish results from years of bloodwork
      * Scored on the Beighton Scale and reassured that I an indeed on the hEDS spectrum, not just hypermobile.
   * ENT
      * Deviated septum and told by ENT doctor my nose seems to be ""lacking cartilege where there should be some"" - so every time I breathe, my nostrils get sucked shut and I don't get as much air in as I should. He told me to try wearing a nasal dialator so I wear one most days (makes a world of difference but gets really uncomfortable by halfway through the day). He said surgery is another option but to take care of my other issues first.
   * TMJ
      * noticed symptoms back in college/after college
      * mostly told by doctors there's nothing they do about it except ""give steroid injections when it gets bad enough that you can't talk or breathe""
      * went otherwise untreated for years (did have two steroid injections several years apart)
      * went to a ""dental sleep medicine"" practice and that doctor had me try day and night splints for extended periods of time, PRF injections (3 rounds, combined with laser treatments each time), and a sphenopalatine block (that reduced some of the trigeminal neuralgia episodes but they came back)
      * Currently:
   * Vestibular
      * tested negative for POTS
      * tested positive for a mild vestibular imbalance
   * Neurological
      * too much to put in here but basically i've been dealing with progressing (noticeable) neurological issues for the last 5-6 years or so, with a huge uptick over the last year, then a really quickly progressing series of seizure-like episodes in May through August of this year that sent me to the emergency room (rushed in an ambulance, lost awareness and memory a lot) - they were severe enough that they terrified my downstairs neighbor and she said she kept asking if I could wake up (I was unconscious to my knowledge and unresponsive per her (amublance bill said ""stupor""), and having a horrible wave of weird feelings, distorted visual images while my eyes were closed, and a very disturbing and scary sleeplike state - I have a few seconds of memory of the ambulance ride and seeing an ER door (being rolled out of ambulance in stretcher), then a few memories of ""coming to"" in the ER room and being confused about why I was there; unfortunately my doctors and medical records continue to say that I never lost consciousness)
      * The episodes last for hours and include:
      * Build up of progressing neurological symptoms over the last 6-8 years. Diagnosed with suspected Functional Neurological Disorder (FND), told I have psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, then told it was simple partial seizures, then after multiple intense ambulance rides/emergency trips, a spot EEG, and 4-day EEG, my current neurologist ruled out epilepsy but said my EEG was not good. He's testing me for periodic paralysis, hypokalemia, and other things. The episodes result in things mimicking focal aware and focal impaired seizures, with a few instances of going unconscious and my vitals in the critical range (high lactic acid, low sodium/hypokalemia, high sustained heart rate, low blood pressure; one episode (after given contrast dye and a nitric oxide pill during the coronary CT) made my blood pressure shoot super low and my heart rate tank into the 40s for 30-40 minutes, they had to get me in a wheelchair, hook me up to IVs and give me coffee water and a banana.
   * Osteopenia: 
      * Unexpectedly got a double compression fracture in a jiu-jitsu/MMA class in 2022. It was missed on the first scan. It was found several months(?) later, I did not receive p/t until months after that.
      * Another doctor found mild scoliosis and signs of chronic pars fractures on subsequent scans, and I believe at one point there was a disc bulge (or something like that) from the fracture site.
      * I had a DEXA scan and was told I have osteopenia and was monitored/counseled by a NP at the AHN Osteoporosis Clinic. Had my second DEXA two weeks ago (September 2024) and the results showed a T-score of -1.3 in my spine (noted as ""low range of normal"" on the results) and between -0.5 and 1 in my hip and forearm. I believe if I remember right, my spine curves and there's slight compression on my right side.
      * I now have daily mild intermittent back pain to the right of my lower spine, mostly with sitting or standing for long periods. It helps to hang from something and decompress my spine.
      * I compared this recent DEXA result to the 2022 one and it appears my bone density remained the same in my spine, but the AHN clinic said it was “normal” and no further guidance. I just take bone health supplements and try to eat well and keep up with bodyweight style exercises for strength training.
   * Hormones
      * 2022/2023 - went an entire year without menstrual cycles (physical and mental stress), resulted in non-detectable estrogen levels but was told nothing could be done and to just work on stress reduction so that my cycles come back. It was during this time that I fractured my back. My cycles are back and (mostly) regular now but with severe cramps and occasionally heavy bleeding and PMS symptoms. I had HPV twice in my early-mid 20’s (lasting for a long time each time) despite having the vaccine against it, and was told at one point I had abnormal squamous cells with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and had colposcopies twice. I was told I was fine and to just continue with my normal yearly pap smears. My current OBGYN is monitoring me via yearly exams but I never really got an explanation of anything from any of my OBGYNS.
   * Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)
      * Was dx'd with this due to exclusion several times over the last 5+(?) Years. my PCP also keeps noting fibromyalgia, I think because he doesn't know what else to put
   * Bloodwork:
      * usually ""mostly"" normal, but with some CBC and metabolic factors in the borderline low/high range, with CBC levels slowly going down. Recently low RBC and trace myocytes and something else that was related to premature bone marrow cells floating around my bloodstream
      * *Porphyria urine test: (ordered by neurologist)*
* Mental health
   * Dx'd with CPTSD from an abusive relationship (relationship in 2015-2018) - invovled rape, sexual coercion, emotional abuse, control, isolation, and threats of violence (with a gun). My abusive ex-partner (fiance at the time) also wrecked my car with me in it in 2016 for unknown reasons - he started staring into space and sped up the car into the 90 mph range on a busy winding highway - the car hit a curb, rolled 4-5 times up an apartment entrance driveway, and crashed into one of the dumpsters and landed on the side. Seatbelts saved us. I crawled out of the window and down the hill until the ambulance came. ***I had a significant concussion from this, underwent months of vestibular and ocular therapy (was told my right eye was drifting off a bit and they had to ""undrift"" it). I was laid off of my job (another enviornmental consulting job) after being on short term disability for 6 months, two weeks before I was scheduled to come back. Told they no longer needed my position.***
   * Had severe OCD when I was younger, and it came back after college after moving back in with my parents for a time. ""Pure-O"" type of OCD. Underwent successful ERP therapy with a therapist specialized in OCD. Thankfully no longer disabled from it.
   * Chronic tension, mild fight-or-flight state, anxiety. I do just about every mindfullness trick and coping stratety in the book. Periods of intense unwanted isolation made it worse (usually due to being gone for work, being too ill and tired to be able to hang out with friends where they go/are, being housebound when I'm really symptomatic/in pain and sick. being 20-30 mins away from all of my friends, and people not really understanding why I have to cancel on plans or stay home/do something less tiring. Had to quit martial arts classes and lost my community there. Fieldwork for job was isolating
      * now found a good group of friends through a local climbing gym (I'm able to go there and just hangout/work on my laptop/read, without climbing or working out much) so this got much better but I'm still tense in all of my muscles and have to watch myself all day because I easily go into flight/anxiety mode. Usually can mitigate it now with breath and mindfulness, grounding, etc. Definitely gets triggered as the IBS bloating, TMJ pain, back pain, ankle pain, etc get worse
   * have a great therapist and psychiatrist now
      * *before, had a bad experience when an psych NP switched me from 40mg buspar to prozac - during the titration phase I wound up in the ER with seratonin syndrome like symoptoms (doc ran some tests and said he didn't think it was though, but he's ""seen this before"" from prozac)*
* Family history (relevant, to my knowledge):
   * Epilepsy 
      * Sister – dx’d with a “seizure disorder” then finally epilepsy. Late onset (in her late 20’s early 30s). Dx’d with both epileptic and PNES seizures after epilepsy monitoring unit study. Trial and error medication, finally found one but has a major grand mal every year or so. Had/has absence seizures, petit mal, grand mals.

"I(38F) have chronic hypotension and idiopathic tachycardia. No history of addiction. Medications: Buspar, Hydroxyzine, Qelbree, Cholestyramine, and Metroprolol. FTR, I started taking the Qelbree recently after a long bout of not addressing my ADHD anymore due to my Adderall not playing well with Tachycardia (by choice; my PPC would've continued prescribing). Tachycardia has not worsened, though I know that can be a side effect. 

I've experienced a lot of medical trauma over the past two years. I have Social Anxiety Disorder and selective mutism, so I'm not great at advocating for myself. A little less than 2 years ago, I developed an abscess on my left kidney and sepsis. During my 2 week hospital stay, I discovered I have a stupid high tolerance for pain medication. I don't typically take any pain medications/opiates so I don't know why. Pain management was not great, but it was somewhat okay, because, while getting the drain placed in my kidney was kinda awful, I typically had a high pain tolerance.

They found gallstones while I was there and I had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy the following month. The surgeon cut a bile duct lengthwise with the cauterizer and I spent a year in and out of the hospital (mostly 4 hours away in a cancer center with surgical oncologists). Several rounds of sepsis, several biliary drains. My pain tolerance dwindled and my blood pressure was constantly in the way of pain relief. At one point, I was forcibly pinned down while I was cut into to place a new biliary drain, which I was assured I would have twilight sleep for, because my blood pressure was too low. Several bouts of appendicitis immediately following waking after ERCPs while my nurse tried (and usually failed) to get my pain under control. My blood pressure was constantly cited as the reason they couldn't give me more (in some cases, anything). My veins became worthless and I ended up with tons of scar tissue. Super hard stick. I'm now terrified of needles. I've been hospital-free since February-ish, which is excellent, because I was in at least once a month for 1-2 weeks before.

I now have a kidney infection (not diagnosed, but I'm sure, because I've had many). UTI set in Monday morning, symptoms showed it reached my kidneys by this morning, and I know sepsis will set in soon, based on prior experience. I realize I need to get treatment. This isn't about that. 

Despite having zero addiction history, and only being hospitalized (repetitively) because of legitimate and urgent medical reasons, my lack of response to pain medication has led to me being treated like a drug seeker. I don't want to get high. I just want to not suffer. I'm terrified to go in for this, because I don't know how to handle the fact that there will be needles (full-blown phobia now), probably MRIs (I'm claustrophobic), and no pain relief. I can't deal. I know I'm a major pussy at this point (I swear, I didn't start that way), and I'm awful at advocating for myself. What are my actual options for pain management with hypotension and how do I advocate for myself? I honestly cannot handle ever going through what I went through again.

ETA: I've been diagnosed with PTSD due to medical trauma. That seems to result in a range of reactions, mostly annoyance. I do understand that my current handling of medical problems isn't totally rational. Also, I'm a redhead, which a nurse mentioned might affect my pain meds tolerance.",1
"Hi. 



Reference doc list:

Doc A - my GP

Doc B - telemedicine psychiatrist (no longer seeing due to rules around what meds can be RXed via telemedicine)

Doc C - current psychiatrist



29F. Recent re-onset of general anxiety disorder, ADHD (new diagnosis by Doc C). I've had insomnia before in my life as a teenager, they put me on Ambien, it sucked. As a teen I dealt with situational depression and anxiety. From 20-28 I was doing better. Now my anxiety is full swing.

I've been dealing with insomnia since at least February with it worsening. I cannot fall asleep without the aid of medication + supplements. I cannot STAY asleep more than 3 ish hours.

As a previous sufferer of insomnia, I'm very familiar with good bedtime hygiene. I don't eat close to bed, no harsh lights, phone, etc. I cuddle with my cats and play Scrabble or something with my partner, then we go to bed. I get exercise. I do not need these suggestions.


I often wake INTO panic attacks. If I don't wake into panic attacks, then half the time I end up getting one because I know my day is going to be shit with 3ish hours of sleep. I do not remember dreams so I do not think it's nightmares.

I have not had one night since February 2024 (when I started tracking) where I've slept through the night like I used to - best I've had is 6 hours straight, and that was after being awake for 32 hours.

I can easily stay awake for over a day without taking medication.


I've been prescribed or tried the following:
- Hydroxyzine 30mg
- Trazodone 10mg (I hate this one - congestion and head aches)
- Benadryl 25mg
- Unisom (doxylamine succinate)

Combine each of those with an additional:
- Melatonin 10mg
- various magnesium supplements

Sometimes I have utilized CBD in combo with all of the above. Still the same results.

Ex. Last night I took 30mg Hydroxyzine and 10mg melatonin at 11pm, asleep approx 1145. Woke up at 3 am. No panic, but couldn't get back to sleep.



Other medications:
Lexapro 10mg (started 1 month ago)
Buspar 5mg (started one month ago) 2x daily



I have a Mirena IUD that needs to be switched because it is not as effective (returning severe periods, mood swings, acne) but that's not possible til March 2025. I do suspect my hormones play a part.



Normal CMP, CBC, iron panel, thyroid panel, B12, slightly low vitamin D but Ive had way lower. That's all that was tested so far.



My partner does not say I snore or toss and turn. I simply wake up after 3 hours into a panic attack, or I wake up after 3ish hours, and either stay awake or work myself into a panic attack. This is even after Lexapro.



I don't think my doctors currently (A and C) are considering I LITERALLY mean I'm getting this much sleep a night and have it documented. I keep being told the same things. I've only had bloodwork once. I'm looking to change from my psych, Doc C, as well.




What is there else that could be checked? Cortisol levels via saliva? A sleep test? Sleep medicine in my area only offers sleep apnea testing as far as I can see.",1
"im a 20 y/o woman, i weigh maybe 150-160. i take buspar 3x a day, ativan on occasion and occasional propranolol. 

last night i was going to bed after a long night at work (im a tattoo artist, and i was sitting for a good 6 hours tattooing) and i’ve been having dull shooting achy oains in the lefr side of my chest and ledt arm. dull, it never gets worse and ive had my heart checked many times before bc of my cardiophobia. had a couple harmless heart palps yesterday too because i didn’t eat at all until i got home. for context. i have super bad panic disorder and ive had ekgs, holter monitors and bloodwork done. i just getbsk antsy because this new thing is well, new! 

but as i started to fall asleep, my body just?? felt super heavy ans unmovable? my hearing went out and my brain was still alert being super confused like “what the hell is happening??” and i was ablw to shoot awake a coulle seconds later, like i wasn’t asleep?? but??? i don’t know. i don’t know if it was me FALLING asleep or something i don’t know. 

im awake now and im super antsy thinking about what ir could be now that the pain is there and im thinking i passed out but you dont remain conscious when you’re passed out?? but i dont know?? im super scarwd and im terrified. idk if uts just because i was so exhausted and my body is sore from tattooing for so long?? or?? i don’t know im like freaked out.

* = tried multiple times, ^ = severe adverse side effects 

I have struggled with major depression my whole life. It is genetic on both sides of the family. I was diagnosed and began treatment for it at age 16 after suffering silently since about age 8. Currently I am trying cymbalta for the second time and unfortunately it isn’t working. I am working with a psychiatrist I love (along with a therapist and host of other specialists for my various issues) but I’m starting to feel like a hopeless case. I feel like I have tried so many drugs from so many classes, often with bad side effects, horribly slow titration processes as I am very sensitive to medications in general, and nothing to show for it. My longest medication was effexor for about 5 years but my body has a nasty habit of getting used to psych meds and they decrease in efficacy. 

Where do I go from here? Is there any particular medication that sticks out to someone as “oh you should try this next”? I’m looking into Neurostar but the history of migraines and BP2 may disqualify me. Of course it doesn’t help that the cymbalta isn’t working so the depression is just bad in general right now (for the record I am physically safe and my fiancée is aware that I’m not doing fantastic/I have a great support system). 

Just looking for any and all ideas. I have a follow up with my doc Sept. 11 (though trying to get in sooner) and the thought of having to go back to the drawing board yet again is just. Really disheartening. TYIA if you’ve read this far. ",1
"For context I am a 25yr old female who has a history of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Despite getting more severe emotional and anxiety symptoms during my menstrual cycle, I had been relatively stable for at least 5 years or so up until November 2023 when I was admitted to the hospital after having a 5 day long manic/panic episode (I was diagnosed with panic disorder at the hospital but my psychologist thinks it was a manic episode) in which I couldn’t sleep even for a second. I had previously been taking a corticosteroid for 2 weeks and I think it triggered this episode, as it was very severe and had never happened to me before. At this time I was taken off my daily Prozac (20mg) and Ativan (1.5mg) prescriptions and put on 100 mg of Seroquel at night, 2 mg of Clonazepam at night, 10 mg of buspar twice a day, and 112.5 mg of Effexor in the morning. This combination was the only thing that got me to sleep. I noticed dry mouth when upping my Effexor dose and I struggled with major grogginess from the seroquel/Klonopin combo during the day but I managed. Fast forward like 8 months from November to June, I was doing fine and feeling good on the combination. With an IOP program, I titrated down on the Klonopin and finally stopped taking it in June. A month later, I started to feel really sick during the day with fatigue and what I thought was low blood pressure. I got some blood tests run, they were all normal except low vitamin B12 and ferritin. I was put on a vitamin b12 supplement but not iron. I also cut back my seroquel from 100 mg to 75 and then to 50 mg over the course of the week due to my worry that it was exacerbating my low blood pressure. After getting to 50 mg, shit hit the fan. I was experiencing major headaches, brain fogs, and vertigo that made even the slightest movement make me feel unsteady. I felt so sick and on the verge of tears every day. I was put back up on the seroquel and when I did not feel better, back up to 0.125 mg of Klonopin. This helped for a few weeks although I have felt unsteady and weak since. Starting 3 days ago I have now had tachycardia. I woke up in the middle of the night 3 days ago with my heart racing, I got up, freaked out, called EMS, and my heart rate was 120 bpm and blood pressure 148/100. At the hospital my rhr was 105 bpm and my ekg came back as sinus tachycardia. They sent me home, I went to the cardiologist, and he thinks nothing is wrong with my heart. I have noticed that the tachycardia only happens at night after I take my seroquel dose and I am worried that for some reason I am now not tolerating my seroquel well, even though I have been on it since November. My heart rate also tends to increase after taking my Effexor in the morning but not usually to more than 100 bpm. None of my doctors (cardiologists, psychiatrists, pharmacists) know what’s up. I started to have panic attacks during the day because I am so worked up about this. I want to get off of the seroquel and even the Effexor because I am so frustrated and worried about the tachycardia but I am worried about withdrawal. I need advice, if anyone has any, about what to do with my medications. ",1

Was anxious last night went to bed at like 5am and woke up at 12pm. Slept and napped for a couple hours during the day after that. Went to fold laundry and accidentally fell asleep for another 3-4 hours. I’m still tired, I’m always tired forever and ever. At work I get to were I yawn and yawn and my eyes start watering and it looks like I’m crying and I get even more tired. Sometimes I’m okay but most of the time I’m tired and I could sleep. Last night I’d not slept till 5 because I convinced myself something awful would happen if I slept. Idk if it’s just normal sorry if this is stupid. I got labs drawn at my last appointment to see my pnp but it won’t be for a while till I see her. I’m assuming they came back okay since they didn’t call me to tell me otherwise",1
"I’m 20f and have had severe vertigo for 3 days with no stopping of the dizziness. About 2 months ago I started buspar for anxiety and started experiencing dizziness, but it was a common side effect and didn’t limit me from doing anything so I kept taking it. About 3 weeks ago I got the dosage upped and the dizziness increased. I was hoping it would eventually go away but it didn’t. The other day I woke up from a nap with the worst vertigo I’ve ever had. The room is spinning and it’s hard to walk because I’m so off balance. I feel sick. I have to squint or only keep one eye open when I’m up because that seems to be the only way my eyes can somewhat focus. My eyes feel like they are moving back and forth (it doesn’t look like they are). I went back down to the original dose of buspar hoping it would stop the dizziness but it hasn’t (I thought it would by now since the half life and bioavailability is so short). Nothing is wrong with my hearing. Any ideas what could be wrong?",1

Sex: F

Race: White 

Duration of complaint: 3 days

I’m 35F. I just started propranolol 10mg twice a day about a week ago to prevent migraines and anxiety. I started out only taking one a day in the morning on July 1st and moved to two a day a few days ago (I believe Thursday). The slow start was recommended by my doctor so I could monitor my heart rate and blood pressure the first few days while I was awake. 

However, the last two days I have had extreme dry mouth. It feels like no matter how much water I drink, I cannot make my mouth feel less dry. My throat feels very dry too, making it almost feel like it’s swollen. The dry mouth is causing a lot of anxiety because it makes me feel like I can’t breath, but my O2 and everything are fine. I also have waves of anxiety and my heart will start racing out of no where. I’m not sure if all of this could be a side effect of the propranolol or if it would be something else since the dry mouth only started the day before yesterday and I’ve been on the medication a week. 

Another option could be that I drank a Matcha Chia Latte for the first time Sunday and had another today. Could this potentially be unrelated to the medication and maybe a result of an allergy to matcha? 

My heart rate has been kind of all over the place since starting and I’m feeling very floaty and dizzy. I did initially start this medication because of chronic dizziness that they believe is a result of my migraines. I honestly do not know how much all of this could just be anxiety or actually a side effect of the meds. 

The other medications I take are Viibryd 15mg (1x day), Buspar 7.5mg (2x day), Singulair 10mg (1x day), Omeprazole 40mg (2x day), Claritin (1x day), and some vitamins I can list if needed. I also take Ibuprofen regularly (1-3x a day) due to my chronic migraines. 

Any insight would be greatly appreciated! ",1

"Long story short I'm a 23F with bpd symptoms but not a super firm diagnosis, lots of panic disorder, and some anxiety. the panic and the dread is by far the worst part of my symptoms atm. I saw a pmhnp a couple weeks ago, I told them I was on 75 effexor, 60mg buspar, and 50 mg hydroxyzine with still tons of panic attacks that are so bad I'm self harming, panic that is so bad I think my world is crashing around me, so obviously just this med combo isn't doing it. I've asked for more help during the panic, and i've been told just take more hydroxyzine which is helpful but not as helpful as something else would be. I got .5 mg ativan for the worst of the panic, which is progress and what I felt I needed and I probably only get that bad once every week or couple of days so addiction isn't scaring me too much with the ativan. The buspar, I take the max dose every day, my effexor i have been claiming gi issues with as well. I saw a new psychiatrist and she was an MD as well, she gave me 30 mg remeron to take at night in place of the effexor and told me to go off of effexor cold turkey... I don't really feel comfortable with this plan at all the more I'm researching remeron and the withdrawals of effexor. Is cold turkey quitting 150 safe? I have been on it since april, and on 150 for about a month. From what I've heard about effexor withdrawals this seems like a mild death warrant, and I'm extremely insecure about my weight and adding remeron now knowing how popular weight gain is on it kinda freaks me out. I also asked for more help with my bpd symptoms and mood swings, emptiness, etc. She said she wanted to put me on vraylar in the future but wanted to start remeron and stop effexor before trying vraylar. Is this a doctor I should listen to? What would yall do?",1
I had an er visit a couple days ago and and my QTC (b) was 473 and QTC (f) was 452 and now I cannot stop overthinking I have prolonged QT. I’m a 28 year old female and I do have health anxiety. So now I have downloaded this ECK+ app to read my watch readings and I cannot sleep. I’m on lexapro 10 mg already and just started buspar so I’m hoping my meds aren’t the issue here. I have been on lexapro for 7 years and nobody has ever said anything about my QT interval. Now I’m ruminating that something is wrong. I see a cardiologist already and he’s never said anything either. I did this on my Apple Watch which says 423 (f) and 437 (b). Is this normal for female? ,1

I take Buspar and Valacyclovir
I am anemic and i have PoTs but no symptoms in years. 
I went to the hospital 3 days ago because I thought I was dehydrated. I lost my vision and got super dizzy all while driving and in a split second. Turns out I have a vertebral artery dissection with a pseudo aneurysm on my left side. And then on my right side, I just have a vertebral artery dissection with a blood clot.
They took an MRI and I apparently have not had a stroke yet. They're also saying my symptoms have nothing to do with the aneurysm or blood clot which makes zero sense to me because all of this started happening around the time they suspect the Dissections happened. All of my doctors at the ER have been confused because they've all said they have never seen it on both sides like this. They can't do surgery because of it being on both sides and they need blood flow on at least one side to do it. They were supposed to do a vanogram but then changed their mind and discharged me?? Now my symptoms have definitely gotten better since Thursday when it started. All of my symptoms were stroke symptoms and they 100% thought that I had one until the MRI showed otherwise. I'm confused as to how my symptoms would have nothing to do with this major finding at the same time they think the dissections happened? They told me that there was nothing they could do for me except put me on blood thinners and hope for the best. They're predicting a stroke in the near future and they definitely drilled in my head t it's very dangerous but then all of a sudden act like they didn't care. I just feel like there's something missing here and my symptoms are definitely related in some way. All of the symptoms l've had such as headache, weak on one side, vision loss (that is still happening along w the headache and difficulty processing stuff), very slurred speech and hard to read and process, and extreme dizziness are literally symptoms that you can have from an aneurysm and it's also the same as stroke symptoms so i'm just wondering if there's maybe something the doctors missed or couldn't see? They straight up told me the MRI would have picked something up if the symptoms were related. Also, if my head continues to hurt on just my left side like it has been for the past 24 hours along with my wonky vision, should I go to a different ER or would that be just a waste of time? I just don't know what to do and them telling me this was very serious and I could have a stroke or even die at any moment so to be careful and then randomly sending me home out of the blue has really confused and worried me. I do not think they communicated enough at all, although I understand they're saying there's not much more they can do for me. They also told me to return to work tomorrow after I got discharged today?? I drive for a living so l definitely cannot do that. I think i'm just terrified. I'm 23 and i've never had anything like this happen before, so I want to make sure I understand what is happening to me and if I should maybe search for another solution. Was everything the ER did reasonable and i'm just overthinking and not wanting to accept? Or is there anything else anyone thinks it could be? An additional issue or something maybe missing? ",1
