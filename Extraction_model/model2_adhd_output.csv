"I know this will be hard for you to read as I still have some left in my system and am very tired.
I normally take 70mg of vyvanse. Yesterday I took 200mg of vyvanse and felt nothing at all. Because I'm the smartest person known to man I decided I could take 110mg more than the day before. I'm was so smart, I was thinking I didn't take enough (the idiot inside screamed the fuck makes you think this can end well) I had taken 70mg for at least three years so I knew I had the tolerance of fucking superman. Such a high tolerance it didn't even matter that I was just above 120 pounds and skinny as fuck. This goes everywhere. 

I'm fairly sure I OD'd, I was pale as a vampire, breathing hard, had an irregular heartbeat, extremely restless (could not stop tapping feet for than a few seconds, and only while I was thinking about it) twitches, tiredness, strange neaseu that was made pleasant by dopamine I'm sure, tremors, not sure what this qualifies as but I'm just gonna call it a hallucination, but I was checking to see if my veins would pop out if cut of circulation on my wrist (using my hand) and it just looked like it wasn't supposed to be the way it was and it was different not different like it being sorta purpleish and coldish and veins hardly popping out but different yet not different, my hands were cold and stiff, any sudden movements of my hands caused that pins and needles feeling, I became fatigued from small tasks such as holding my phone and standing as well, I told myself I was going to sit down but I was looking at phone sand then I ended up completely zoning out and like ten minutes later I realized that i was still standing there I only snapped out of it because I was tired from tapping my foot, I became slightly confused, very spacey, the tingling I had welcomed and enjoyed at first had become the ever present potent and undying voice of my stupidity, became good at writing for some reason, or at least wanting to do it, brain was to clouded to write during this, but I've been writing long paragraphs in reponse to text messages that were easily answered in one or or two sentences, the buzzing was really huge, I was very light headed, my vision blurred as well, I couldn't focus on more than one thing at a time and that one thing became the only thing that existed until Something brought me back, I kinda felt like I was dreaming, and my muscles were extremely tense I didn't notice at first but then I relaxed and realized I was pretty much flexing most of my major muscles also was closing my jaw really for no reason. I'm still feeling some of it now, I still have slow and clouded thought process, nothing compared to earlier though, low blood pressure and I'm sure cold is an effect of this, still tapping my foot but it is small movements, every once in a while I get a get a warm feeling, I'm startled easily and when I'm startled it's like a pleasant feeling but the thing is I hate it now, it also greatly increases the enjoy ability of the butterflies cuz person you like. I am Fairly sure I'm not going to die, but is there a way to increase my blood pressure? Or is it better just to go to sleep? My pulse is more or less going back to normal (slowed to a worrisome rate at one point and was also pretty faint now it's getting back to normal) on it, not sure how to explain. Should I sleep? Or should I stay awake? Again if I would've died it would've most like been a couple hours ago. Thats when most symptoms were the worst. This was my first time ever getting high and will be last. I didn't even like the part of the high that didn't scare the bloody fuck out of me. It was quite dull and I took three tests and wrote an essay fairly fine. I remember thinking it was getting kinda stronger towards the end of the day and fuck did it get strong.


Tl;Dr: I'm a fucking 120 pound genius that took a shitload of vyvanse and had the perfect first high, OD's are bitchin' and I guess should I sleep? Not going to the doctor or seeking medical help unless I beilve I should. Or if you explain very reasonably why I could die or be seriously injured.


Edit: I just took a piss for 2 minutes straight non stop, I'm not exaggerating. I'm in awe that my bladder didn't explode. I don't even know how I went that long without peeing. I feel a lot better in a way that I can't really explain too well. I think my fuzzy dream headache is gone and replaced with a not so fuzzy but still kinda fuzzy headache. Seriouusly does vyvance make you not feel the need to pee? I mean it was a mind boggling amount of piss. The stream was really thick once it came smoothly. It stared with a bunch of fucked up streams that made no sense. Up side down, everywhere, and I don't even. The fuck am I even writing this for? It literally as nothing to do with anything. I got pretty fucked up didn't I? Normally I think I would have explained this entire page in a few sentences. I've never felt like I had lower intelligence and thinking ability (not because of me thinking I'm an idiot for doing something stupid I actually feel like I killed a ton of brain cells) but for some reason people have been saying I should be a writer. My mind goes blank when trying to think of a reason. The thing they said that on I was pretty much in an automatic writing mode where the words are controlled by me but stoping isn't. Which is why I'm still awake. That and still a bit paranoid imma die in my sleep or something. I literally can't stop. I'll try really hard now.",1,
"I tried adderall for the first time last year, and started regularly buying it from kids about 6 months ago. Initially I just used it to plow through finals or big projects, but then began taking it for work to get through the day. So now, 6 months, of abusing the drug almost everyday, I've built my tolerance, but have also been having strange symptoms.

I usually actually took vyvanse because it was easier for me to get and was regularly taking 60mg a day. I recently have gotten connections to adderall, switched, and love it for the less headaches. But I know I continue to build my tolerance, I took 65mg today.

I've never been great at handling stress, but lately it's been terrible. Lots of crying and shaking when I'm stressed. I went to a therapist who told me I suffered from anxiety. I have insomnia many nights. I feel nauseous often. I've lost about 15lbs within the past month. And this may or not be related, but I've developed a dry rash that almost resembles mosquito bites. The doctor I saw for this told me he could not determine what type of rash it was, said it'd likely go away in a couple weeks, but has still persisted.

So my boyfriend knows how much adderall and vyvanse I do, and occasionally asks for some if a big test is coming up. But today, he asked me to either get a doctor's approval and prescription or to stop doing the drug everyday. 

I know I complained of all those symptoms, but the thing is, I cannot go a day without the drug. I use it to simply just get through the day, school or no school. I DO not want to be dependent on a drug, but I don't know how to quit.

If I do need the drug, I am afraid to get a prescription. My parents would be skeptical since I was a high-achieving student in high school, and also my mom doesn't like the idea of drugs that alter brain chemistry.

What do I do? I feel so stupid for getting addicted to adderall! ",1,dry rash
"I don't have ADD or ADHD (to my knowledge). I once took 80mg of Vyvanse to study for school and it made me sleepy, it didn't really help me focus at all but I did crash really hard the next day. 

A different time I took 54mg of Concerta and it also made me sleepy and didn't help me focus. 

I also have depression and anxiety. I get prescribed Wellbutrin and Xanax but I don't take them as regularly as I should and hadn't taken them either of the times I took Vyvanse or Concerta. 

What could be the problem here?",1,sleepy
"Basically, I saw my doctor on Friday, and instead of upping my dose of Vyvanse (because she figured I'd still peak around 3, and it wouldn't help me focus through my evening class) she prescribed Dexedrine 10 mg spansule, to take in the afternoon (around 1)  - and only when needed (ie, working late, evening classes)  is this kind of thing normal?

I am absolutely planning on asking the pharmacist (he's usually helpful in explaining things) but has anybody else with ADD/ADHD had this experience? and have you had any negative side effects?",1,
"I'm planning on going to the doctor tomorrow to get another prescription of Vyvanse for school. The last time that I went for a prescription, I was given a drug test. I'm not totally sure what they were testing for, but I was clean. This time, I smoked pot (2-4 hits from a bowl) for 4-5 nights in a row, ending this past Sunday night. I'm a VERY casual user, those days were the first in about 5-7 months. If I go and and am tested (coming up positive for THC), what would happen? Are they even testing for THC? If not, is that information even useful to them?

I have been using my older sister's leftover Vyvanse, to see if it even helped my attention for my classes. It's done wonders for my study habits and attention paid in class. I only use it for my 2 long days at school, which are Mondays and Wednesdays, otherwise, I don't take it. I will probably test positive for that, but she and I have the same doctor, so will that cause any problems?",1,
"I hope i'll be able to summarize all of this well. Using a throwaway account since my boyfriend and friends also use reddit. 

I've been getting panic attacks since I was 6 years old. As a result of this, the doctor suggested to my parents they put me on anti-depressants at the age of 10. They figured the doctor knew best, and asked me to take them. I was an obedient child, so I did. I'm 23 now. I've still not been able to get off of anti-depressants to this day. I've been struggling with severe depression, horrible self-esteem issues. I had acne from age 11 until I was 19 and finally decided to go on accutane because I was scarring and I knew it wasn't going to get any better. I had tried everything. My skin cleared up and it was amazing but with that only came another health problem. I won't get in to that now. 

All of this had made me obsessive about my skin. For 2 years my acne was so bad I never left my house. Not once. Not even to go in my backyard. I was so ashamed. I already had all of these other flaws on top of acne and I felt like the ugliest creature alive.

Once my acne cleared up, I started to finally go back outside again. It felt amazing. I had hope again. Only a few months later, I caught mono. I was 19 at the time. The only side effect I ever experienced from mono was chronic fatigue. I would sleep constantly. I had to drop out of school. I couldn't even get out of bed to eat or get a glass of water most days. I went to the doctor and they prescribed me some anti-viral medication telling me I should be better in about a month. 

9 courses of anti-virals later and I never got better. I tried everything. Diet changes. Mega-dosing B vitamins. Drinking disgusting amounts of energy drinks, even Redlines. 

I'm with this amazing guy right now. We've been together for 2 1/2 years. It's incredible how patient he has been with me. That he even wanted someone as emotionally and physically damaged as me in the first place. Recently my mono came back with a vengeance. Worse than I ever remember having it. I would fall asleep. It didn't matter where, or what time. The longest I slept was 21 hours.

Of course this interfered with our relationship immensely, so he started researching for me. He found all of these people online who had chronic fatigue caused by chronic mono claiming that adderal saved their lives. My psychologist was willing to give it a shot. She prescribed vyvanse to me, the lowest dose possible. I've been taking it now for exactly a week. But now i'm noticing these small zits appearing on my neck and chest .. places where I haven't broken out in years. So I looked it up, and there were so many people claiming there is a strong link between acne and vyvanse/adderall.

I'm devastated. Because to me there is no choice. I would rather go back to being the way I was sleeping all the time then have to have acne again. I can't do that. My boyfriend is so upset. I know he is because he's been telling me what a difference vyvanse has made. And I know hes' right. Since i've been taking it i've been able to function as a normal human again. 7 hours of sleep is enough. I'm not tired constantly. We even have a sex life again.

I'm usually terrified to express my feelings to anyone because I always, always get the same reply.

""Have you tried counseling?""
""You're ridiculous. That's such a stupid thing to be upset about.""

Tried counseling. Been in a mental hospital 4 times. At this point i'm pretty convinced the easiest answer would be to just kill myself. I'm never going to be a normal person. Mentally or physically. My boyfriend deserves so much better.

Oh and thank you to anyone who bothered reading this.",1,zits
"I’m surprised no one has said this yet, but not eating after 6pm and a close second is intermittent fasting.

When you think of it as a strategic game as to how to shrink your stomach size so you eat less, intermittent fasting is the answer. 

Go to bed hungry for 3-4 nights and you’d be surprised how quickly your stomach size shrinks",1,"stomach size, size"
"I’m betting you get downvoted for this, a lot of people think it’s the “easy” option. Some people have that same opinion towards weight loss surgery too.

But what they don’t realize is that the vast majorly of people are taking this drug as part of an informed decision about their health in conjunction with their doctor. It’s not just celebrities who want to lose 10 lbs to look good on the red carpet.

It is well known that by delaying gastric emptying it makes you feel fuller, so, you eat less. Eating less means you lose weight. But there are other components to how it works too, and a lot of these are being studied. For a lot of obese people, it isn’t simply a moral failing, or that they are just greedy. There is also the concept of food noise, which works in the same way as other addictions.

One description I once saw: imagine a co worker brings in a box of donuts. Everyone will have a donut and go back to work. There are left over donuts that get put in the break room. Most people will just go back to work and get on with their day. But for people who suffer with food noise, all they can think about are those donuts. They aren’t stupid, they know it’s a mistake to have another, but, they are there, and it’s like it’s itching the mind. And that itch won’t go away. Eventually they will not be able to take it any more, and then go and get that second donut. Or maybe even a third.

They aren’t being greedy, it’s similar to how a lot of addictions work. 

Or, constant thinking about food. Like, planning ahead what to eat next, when you’re still eating something else. I had a similar thing when I used to smoke, constantly thinking about and planning my day around when or where I was going to pick up my next pack. When chantix came on the market, you didn’t hear smokers being criticized for taking it, as part of an informed decision about their health. This is no different.

Interestingly, semaglutide (ozempic) and other GLP medications are also being studied as treatments for other addictions, like alcohol. I don’t think there are many people who would criticize people getting help for the awful disease of alcoholism. So, please stop criticizing people who are taking ozempic, wegovy, zepbound etc",1,##epbound
"Ritalin was helping bc the dose I was on made me feel sick halfway through eating. 

Now I’ve switched jobs (less active) and am on a much lower dose and I’m gaining about a kilo every 2 months - start binge eating the moment the Ritalin wears off.",1,"sick, binge eating"
"I got Metformin for my PCOS Insulin Resistance. Once I was on it, the exercise and dieting actually worked. Pre-metformin I would diet and exercise and see zero changes; my weight didn’t drop, there were no non-scale victories, nothing. Once I started taking metformin, it was like a switch was turned on in my body and diet and exercise ACTUALLY worked. 

The shitty part of insulin resistance is that it makes it incredibly hard for you to lose weight, which sucks because the “cure” to insulin resistance is to lose weight.

It’s not a miracle “diet” drug by any stretch of the imagination. To lose weight I still had to diet, exercise and do healthy periods of fasting (no snacking and giving my body time between meals so there were breaks between insulin spikes). 

But once I got in to an easy rhythm of all three, the weight started to fall off. I plateaued after about three months, and my dietician recommended I bump up my calorie intake to a normal range (From ~1500-1800 to ~2000-2200) and try to get the addition calories from proteins. She said to talk to my doctor and a trainer about building muscles. She told me that she often saw plateaus and in her experience 3-4 months of calorie deficit and mostly (but not all) cardio exercise and then switching to a high protein diet within my normal calorie range with a mostly (but not all) strength training exercise, for another 3-4 months and switching back and forth had the most regular results. It worked really well for me, but without the metformin I would still be running and getting nowhere.",1,
"I agree with the willpower growing bit,

"One time I wanted to make brownies. So I made the batter and then put the pan in the oven. Threw the box away. At this point, I saw that the trash was full, so I decided to take it out. While walking to the trash can, I saw my fishing pole and thought it's a nice day outside. Set the trash down and drove to the river with my pole

Once I got at the river I realized I forgot all the bait, but I saw a hole in the ground and wondered what lived in there. So I started digging it out and found some frogs. I wanted to take them to my house because we have a pond and a frogs would make a good edition. I didn't have a bucket to bring them home in so I drove to the store to get one.

Once at the store I remembered I didnt have any fishing bait, so I picked some up and went back to the river. Finally started to fish, after some time I caught a fish and once again realized I had no way to bring it home to eat. Speaking of not being able to bring my dinner home, I decided to let the fish go, pack it up and go get some frozen pizza. 

Finally back at home, I saw there was no trash bag in the can, so I went outside to throw the pizza boxes away. That's when I saw the trash bag I forgot to throw away in the first place. Took care of that mess and went to cook my pizza. I opened the oven and saw my brownie batter that I made quite a few hours ago that I completely forgot about. Luckily, I also forgot to turn the oven on so my house didn't burn down. 

Turned the oven on, got my brownies, they were pretty tasty. Woke up the next morning and wondered why there was an uncooked pizza on my counter...",1,

You can use techniques to calm it and structure to try and keep it regulated but it will still throw tantrums and good luck getting it to do what you need it to do - a good day involves just minimal chaos.

And everyone else is looking at you wondering why you don’t just make your kid behave like theirs does. And you’re exhausted trying to get this kid in line. You can be strict and abusive but that doesn’t get good results - it makes the burnout and rebellion worse than ever and causes terrible pain for everyone. You can be loving and patient and that produces better emotional outcomes but you are still not in control of what happens.

"LIke a good new orleanian, I made a pot of red beans and rice every Monday the summer I stayed on campus. Money was tight, so I'd make a large pot and eat on that for a few days.

That was the plan anyway. Lived in the dorm and the kitchen was off the floor's common room. So, I'd be cooking red beans and rice, seasoning it up, cooking sausage and tossing  it in.

Turned around and had some floor mates walking in asking what smelled so good. Wound up selling a heaping plate of rice and beans for 5$ a plate.

Turned into a thing. Red beans and rice on Monday. Gumbo on Friday.

Paid for all my groceries that summer and bought my books for class with it. Worked out rather well.

Today was my first time taking vyvanse and I’m having one of the common side effects which is insomnia. Does this mean I should switch or should I wait it out?,1,insomnia
"Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, but I'm not too sure where else I should go. 
I have been taking Vyvanse every day for several years now in order to help me be functional during the day. I have tried going off it and tried other meds, but none of them work well for me, and taking Vyvanse is the only way I can be really productive during the day.

However, in the afternoons/evenings when it begins to wear off, I start to feel really horrible. My hands shake, and I become extremely anxious, depressed, become very overwhelmed, and I get a weird very intense feeling of guilt and dread for no real reason.

Does anyone else here who takes Vyvanse or stimulants in general also experience this? If you do, is there any ways I can make this 'crash' less bad? It's really the worst part of my days for me and it makes me feel really awful, but I cant stop taking the medicine. 
Does anyone have or know any suggestions or advice that could help? I just want this feeling to go away or at least be lesser",1,
"I have been on this medication for ADHD for probably 5 years total. I’m just wondering why sometimes it seems perfect and then sometimes it makes a person feel like garbage (tired and depressed)? And I don’t mean later at the “comedown”, I mean shortly after taking the medication.

Background: I have tried methylphenidate —- I was on the short release form for probably 2-3 years, and it seemed to kind of work at the beginning and then for moving forward for some time.. at least, what I mean is, it worked for providing some focus to me for a couple hours in the day.(The long-acting forms, i.e. Concerta and biphentin did not work for me for some reason!). But, then I realized I needed something longer-acting for my lifestyle.. (but it also started making me lethargic somehow, or doing the opposite that it was supposed to!)…

I had also tried Adderall XR —— I think I was on it for roughly a year or a little less (many years ago), but it actually did absolutely nothing good for me at all, and then my P-doc at the time did not let me change back to something else! I had since moved on to a new p-doc, and that’s when I got put on the methylphenidate, and now I’m back on Vyvanse (since methylphenidate seemed to stop working, and I needed something longer-acting anyway!).

I just want the treatment to work for moving forward, consistently, just for once…? :(",1,lethargic
"I'm a 46-year-old male, I went through a divorce in 2010 took no medication, and had no mental illness. After the divorce, I took Vyvanse to focus on work and thought I had a type of Adult Add. At first, I was very focused at work recording very high levels of performance. It started after work I would hear my co-worker's voices when I got home from the office. It gradually grew into hearing persecutory voices all the time of co-workers and friends I grew up with. I isolated because I interpreted the voices as some sort of government technology. I developed this complicated delusional storyline during the Obama administration. It has taken me close to 15 years to realize definitely that the voices and my mental state are a result of mental illness. When you hear this type of interference and eschew thinking it is very difficult to see your own circuits as faulty. It seems to be put there by an outside force. I was sure it was a government trial program of some sort. After these episodes, I go through periods of normalcy and besides an antidepressant, I'm healthy and don't consider myself mentally ill. I'm having problems understanding what my diagnosis is or should be. After a hospitalized episode a therapist diagnosed me with a type of Schizoaffective disorder, then My psychiatrist completely disagreed and said its on the Bipolar Spectrum. Since it completely goes away the voices and paranoid thinking I'm leaning towards the Bipolar disorder. But when I'm in the dormant period, like now, I'm thinking that since I realize that it is my brain that caused the crossed thinking It won't happen again. My question is am I being Naive?? I have been hospitalized over 10 times in the last 15 years. Could I be at a stage where by seeing through the episode as my brain causing the illness, the clarity cures the illness because that gives the paranoia that I experience no power?? There definitely is some gray area with these illnesses but where I'm at now I don't see how my brain can dupe me into another hospital stay if that makes sense??",1,

We just had snow days and I really slacked and didn’t take my Vyvanse for 3 consecutive days. The two latter nights of that time period had me experiencing a nightmare both nights. Badddd ones. Like one of them, I don’t even really remember the details of, but when I woke, I was in a full blow panic. Yes I should be more consistent with this med, and I plan to do better, but this just seems like a very odd side effect… not even sure if it really is related… :/",1,
"My husband had a cannabis induced psychotic episode this month. I had no idea it was coming on until it got REALLY bad 2 weeks ago and I brought him to the hospital and the doctors decided to commit him. He was there for about 6 days, it was a pretty traumatic experience for him because he was so confused the whole time. It was so awful to watch because he was not at all himself and he was so out of control of his mind it was just so awful to watch him suffer like that. I was there with him every single day and every day they had him on anti-psychotics he got a little bit better.

But post-hospitalization I’ve realized he still is having delusions even though he’s still taking his medication. He has these beliefs that he’s the shadow of a 4th dimensional being and they’re sending him signs about things. He still believes all the things he was believing while he was in the height of his psychotic episode. The paranoia is lessening thankfully but he’s doubling down on these beliefs with me to the point where he’s considering leaving me because I don’t believe the same things as him now. He believes he’s recieving signals in his dreams because he wants to connect with these beings through his consciousness. I can’t find any info online if this is normal or not for delusions to continue like this.

It’s been getting so difficult for me because I’m starting to wonder about my sanity sometimes having him basically give me an ultimatum about this in a way. But he’s only 1 week post-hospitalization and he’s considering these huge life changes. I’m just so confused and I don’t know what to do. I don’t believe these things but I don’t want to lose him but I also don’t want to encourage him with these delusions.

I’m just so lost and exhausted right now. 
Does anyone have any advice?

Edit: he believes he’s having a spiritual awakening on some spiritual journey he’s on. He’s on certain subreddits too that are really fuelling these beliefs. I’m just at a loss of what I should do",1,
"for reference i have BPD2, borderline, OCD and BED. over the years ive tried sertraline, prozac, wellbutrin, abilify, and vyvanse for my condition. vyvanse 5mg is great for my BED and the wellbutrin xl 150mg was great for my depression for about 8 months before it seemingly stopped working, sending me into mania and psychosis, which landed me in a psych ward where i was put on seroquel 100mg. 

although seroquel is great for my sleep and somewhat for my mood, just like prozac and abilify, it gives me debilitating death anxiety. the anxiety attacks hit me like a train 4-6x a day and ill get multiple rapid thought cycles about passing away, being dead, etc. this side effect does not go away with time, and lowering the dose never helps. i considered trying sertraline again but it was merely a bandaid placed atop a 10in bleeding wound - it made little to no difference.

i feel so unfixably broken and im scared no drug will ever properly work for my disorders long term. im thinking maybe i should suggest to my psychiatrist that we increase the dose for wellbutrin to see if that does the trick since the side effects are minimal for me, but im afraid she'll give me a side eye for already wanting to discontinue seroquel.

i have no idea what to do and i don't want to keep trying different drugs. what would you do in my shoes?",1,"death anxiety, anxiety attacks"
"I've struggled with constant, intense racing thoughts my entire life, leading to anxiety and depression. To clarify I was diagnosed with Bipolar type 2 and ADHD. Now when I say I have racing thoughts, I mean that I am constantly over thinking so fast that sometimes I have to enact a physical or verbal reaction like turning my head quickly, or something like that, to stop a thought process. it's been going on my entire life. While I had been prescribed medications for depression and ADHD (ex:
Zoloft, buspirone, gabapenton, adderall, Vyvanse) in the past, they haven't helped. 

Then one day I took a low dose of MDMA from my brother, he's a very smart guy and yes he tests everything he has. That low dose of MDMA was like taking the foot off an accelerator, I felt what I thought was normal, I wasn't even overall happy like I was on a higher dose, I just felt calm, not anxious. I was able to dance talk and breathe without excessively over thinking. slowing down my thoughts and making me feel normal for the first time. 

Are there any legal, existing medications that could potentially replicate this calming effect on my mind without the risks associated with MDMA use?",1,
"i'm 19 and i have adhd, severe anxiety, severe depression, high functioning autism, c-ptsd, and i'm still living with my neglectful mom. before medication i was very unstable. 

i was angry, agitated, anxious 24/7, and bed-locked. i couldn't eat because i'd stress about calories, i couldn't sleep until 5am because i'd be up worrying, i couldn't even exercise because i could barely move, and i'd have screaming matches to nobody but myself when my house was empty. i would often throw and hit things, and the slightest thing would send me into a meltdown or a panic attack, despite never being violent to another person. i even had a genuine nervous breakdown at some point.

my psychiatrist started me on vyvanse and propranolol, though, and that helped me so severely. i can move again, complete tasks, i can sleep again. i take my meds an hour before i wake up and i wake up feeling like a person. i'm more patient now, which feels good; i never liked being angry.

strongly recommend this combo, especially if you also have POTS, which i'll be tested for soon. also if you had a bad experience adderall like i did, vyvanse feels nothing like that.",1,

I am in therapy now twice a week, but i don't know how to open up about how severe this was, because im only now realizing. the sheer embarrassment feels like it's going to kill me.

i dont know how to forgive myself or move on. i feel like i will never have a career or savings or a partner or a family or a life. i dont know how im even going to get out of this bed. i just want to know that other people have experienced this and gone on to live fulfilling lives.",1,"ad, psychosis, delusions"
"Before i start, i would like to mention that i have been diagnosed with ADHD, (medicated for it, 40 mg vyvanse and 5-2.5mg decamphetamine (no later than 4pm otherwise i cant sleep) when i need to lock in [obv not medical terminology but thats basically when im advised to take it), and asperghers syndrome, as well as some thing with executive functions or motor functions or something, but if its motor functions it would be very mild and if its executive functions its prolly cuz i procrastonate alot or something idk. The start of this year i also got diagnosed with ASD, however i think its mild.
I used to take fluoxotine, however i stopped because i felt off. Im not sure if it was the fluoxitine or anything else, and im not sure if i still feel it bc i forgot what i felt witch made me stop it to begin with.

As the title says, I keep imagining myself doing something instead of actually doing it, and i get the satisfaction for it

For example, i’d imagine myself sending an email that i need to send, but instead of actually doing it, i go through it mentally. It feels exactly like im actually doing it, except 2 hours later i realise that i havent actually done it. Ive found myself sitting infront of homework, and imagining myself doing it, before i realise ive been stairing for 15 minutes.

On the bright side (sort of), when i get pissed off, i imagine myself destroying my room. Ive never done such a thing, and im mentally stable enough to not follow through. Maybe ill do something not as destructive like slam my hand against a table or scream into a pillow.

But every time i want to tell my parents something, or talk to someone about something important, i imagine myself doing it, and then im calm, and by then, i cant recollect everything that i said in my mind to say in person, and even if i did im wouldbt be in the right mood to do it. Like i’d suddenly feel like everythings okay.

I think of it as sertain thaught processes tied to certain moods, and i can only think specific things and ways in those moods.

As a result i feel disconeected. Its not as extreme as ive made it out to be here, but theres not really any way to descrive it. Ive been feeling a bit numb recently. Not really sure how to help i. Im sure theres many things contributing to it, and not just one thing thats causing it, but i think its a goood idea to seek out thaughts and advice.

"This is gonna be hard to type but screw it. I can’t remember anything and literally can’t learn how to do anything. I have a very hard time communicating and even hanging out with my old buddies because of how little I have to contribute to conversations. I’ve always been a little shy and awkward but it didn’t stop me from being able to do things when I was younger.

It’s gotten to the point to where I won’t call my grandmother because I don’t have anything to say ( just an example). If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be helpful.

" Hi friends. So quick back ground, I have diagnosed adhd, ocd, gad, & some seasonal depression. I’m on Vyvanse, Prozac, trazodone, propanol for test anxiety. Propanol and trazodone are new < 2 months. Everything else I’ve been on for well over a year. 

I graduate law school and business school in like 3 weeks, and start studying for the bar exam in may. So basically my life is a ball of stress right now. 

To sum it up, the past 2-3 week, I absolutely have had no energy. I’m talking going to sleep at 11 pm, waking up at noon. Exhaustion through the roof weak body. It was starting to give me anxiety because I hadn’t been studying for finals and the executive dysfunction & emotional dysregulation kicked in. On the weekends I practically only woke up to eat dinner, and kept it pushing. 

On the other hand of the spectrum, I woke up at 10 am on Wednesday, took my vyvanse and felt so motivated to do school work. I worked on what I needed to, I even went live on TikTok to do a study with me. I felt social and like myself again —- until I didn’t. I went to a dinner, got home around 8/9 pm. I knew I needed to start winding down so I could sleep. 

Out of nowhere it’s like my energy turned itself up a notch, my thoughts were running everywhere, etc. I’ve been stressed out about post grad jobs, so I started applying to jobs. I wanted to stop at like midnight, but my body legit wouldn’t let me. I was applying to jobs and searching until 5am. I then tried to lay down and it was like my eyes felt wide open, and I just wanted to get up and start my day, but I also had horrible anxiety (chest pounding). I forced myself to stay in bed, fell asleep for an hour. 

I took my vyvanse again at 7 am, and it actually made me fall asleep for about two hours. Like I said, I’ve already been on edge with my anxiety for weeks now, so when I woke up and felt like crying I didn’t think anything of it. I went to a meeting about bar prep, and it made me very emotional, but I ended up laying down with my weighted blanket, again couldn’t sleep. Went to class and everything was okay. I was driving home and my panic attack symptoms started to show themselves. 

I had a full on mental breakdown. Screaming & crying about the lack of support during the bad exam & some unfortunate family circumstances 

It took me a second to calm down like an hour or so, and then all of a sudden, I was back to my wired self. Tried to take a nap since i was clearly upset & needed to take a break before I finished an assignment. Nope. I layed in bed and “rested” for 4 hours. Finally got up and got straight to work, obviously got distracted because Vyvanse wore off, but I was not really upset to do my work , having normal convos with my friends, very 180 from me having to pull my car over because I was overwhelmed. 

I finished my paper at2, and I ended up just wanted to do other tasks. So I took a shower. It’s now 4:30 am, I’m laying in bed, and I can’t sleep. My mind is going really fast but also numb at the same time . 

If you’ve stayed this long, thank you. Does anybody have any idea if this is hypomania? I don’t think so because of how my fasts thoughts aren’t necessary elated, I’m really stressed. 

How much longer should I ride this out before seeing a doc?",1,ad
"For starters, I dont feel too depressed lately; all things considered, my mental state is a lot better than it was a few years ago.

But it's still pretty miserable, and I feel like I don't *enjoy* enjoy anything anymore. Sure, I have things that keep me entertained, but I feel like all they do is help me kill time.

So, every weekend, I wake up, and I groggily make the calculation: will anything I could do awake feel ***better*** than staying in bed?

And the answer is no, every time. Sleeping is one of the few things that DOES actually feel ***good***. I dont have to think about where my life is going, or feel guilty that I could be using my time for something better, I just stay there, comfy, and dream something more interesting than my real life.

Sometimes I wont even get up to eat, and only get up when the sun is down.

The worst part is that lately I've really been trying to make changes and actually start improving my life, so every time I waste a valuable day literally doing **nothing**, I feel less and less convinced that I have any hope in changing my lifestyle.

I try every time to argue with myself that getting up and doing shit is the better choice in the long run, but willpower ain't my strong suit, and my half-awake brain will respond every single time with ""*nah, fuck that shit. I want to feel NICE for a change.*""

"I've been diagnosed ADHD twice in my life, once as a child and once as an adult and plagued with depression and anxiety which I've read either go hand in hand with or are exacerbated by ADHD. My PCP put me on some meds for mood and depression, then put me on Vyvanse, then tried a few others before pairing the vyvance up with vraylar and they have me on a low dose of something for bipolar which he says he doesn't believe I have but that it's ""just for sleep"" and I mean, the nightmares stopped but only because I don't dream at all any more, or hardly ever or simply just don't remember having them any more. Anyway, regardless, I asked my PCP about a referral to a psychiatrist but instead they referred me to like, a psychologist/therapy/behavioral health place that my Medicaid covers. 

I've had several sessions with that guy, he seems nice but it's mostly me just talking at him for an hour every two weeks except last week he had a bad sinus infection and I had to wait a whole extra week and I was getting bad. He barely says anything except agreeing about some stuff and every now and then saying ""that might be some negative self talk"" about whatever. 

Today he asked if maybe I wanted him to refer me to a ""wholistic psychiatrist"". What even does that mean? It sounds like someone without a license is what it sounds like to me. I have a shit load of stuff to talk about which is why I never stop talking when I'm in there but I'm not like that anywhere else but there. And I think he said this was the only psychiatrist in the area. Are they gonna use crystals and shit? Are they going to be able to diagnose me with anything else if there *is* something else? (Bipolar I think could be a possibility but if so it's mild). It just sounds like bullcrap. If I need meds, I need meds, if I'm not on the right ones, I need to be to function. What I was doing before I finally got on my meds I would not consider ""functioning"" even though I was almost usually hanging on by a thread.

"My Anxiety is Making Me Unable to Think

I have been a very anxious person for as long as I can remember, even as a very young kid. And I have always had bad memory and not very great focus, but far better than now I believe. The past 5 years or so I have finally tried getting help, but I feel worse off than ever. I've tried Vyvanse because my doctor thought I had ADHD and so did I, but all it did was make my anxiety worse and not help my focus or memory. Since then I've tried sertraline, venlafaxine, and have been on bupoprion for around 6 months now but I don't feel any different, and it's harder than ever to focus or remember anything because the stress of moving out and starting my career.

It's causing me to forget and miss things all the time at work, makes me slow to learn things, slow performing tasks as I keep forgetting steps, messing up on paperwork a lot, keep making dangerous mistakes while driving like forgetting to put my blinker on or look all around before trying to turn and act very impulsive and erratic generally. And by the next day, I question half of what I did the previous day and have a very hard time remembering what I did specifically, making me forget to do things even more.

It's severely affecting me in all aspects of my life and keeps taking more and more from me. I'm trying to get on a waitlist to see a psychiatrist and finally get a proper diagnosis so hopefully I can finally improve, but am trying CBT in the meantime, with great difficulty maintaining motivation to do the homework but trying my hardest. 

But I was wondering if any of this seems familiar to anyone else and what eventually helped you if anything at all. As I just can't keep living like this, I feel like I'll eventually make a mistake or poor choice so bad I won't be able to come back from it",1,
"I keep having mental breakdown episodes.

I'm 26 male, have a formal psychiatric diiagnosis kc Bipolar 2, ADHD and a informal general practitioner diagnoses of anxiety/depression. I've struggled with depersonalization and derealization for 10 years and have continuously been inquiring about it, but receive no explanation for it. 

I'm currently medicated for ADHD 60mg Vyvanse (taking it for one year), nothing for Bipolar 2 as I was diagnosed when I was 17 and several years later after being off medication from 19, I was given an ADHD diagnosed at 25, and thus they believe bipolar was a misdiagnosis. 

Now. I keep hurting myself. I keep feeling so angry and frustrated that I want to cave my head in with a brick. Last week I got so frustrated, angry and sad that I slammed a toothpick 2cm into my thigh muscle (it's still swollen). I've broken wooden dowes over my calves. Smashed a plastic chair over my face. Punched my chest until they're bruised. Hit myself with a baseball bat. 

During my episode last week (my girlfriend and I were in an argument, which are always severe and honestly a trigger for me) I felt so disassociated that I couldn't speak clear sentences, I was sweating even though it was cold, my teeth were chattering, I kept saying the same word repeatedly because it made me feel calmer and I had these almost tic like sensations that made my spine shiver. I couldn't stop crying and at one point I can remember not being able to stop blinking. The whole time my body felt so tense that all my muscles in my body continuously tensed up to the point I was shaking. I'm not sure I could have helped any of it. I still don't feel good and I'm crying almost every second day. My sleep is horrible and I keep having nightmares. These episodes happen maybe once every 3-4 months. 

I want to die but, at the same time I'm scared of dying. I have family and a girlfriend that care for me, but I feel so lonely. I feel like I don't really have any friends. For the past ten years I've been on so many different types of medication, so many types of therapy and I just don't want to do all of it again whi h is why I don't want to talk to a professional. I'm just so tired. I know I won't kill myself, but I'm terrified i could get to that point of no return. It feels like I'm snowballing. 

I hide it all, but even just by typing this on a throwaway account I feel like an attention seeker. 

Writing this all down has realized how insane I am and I'm gonna book an appointment to see a new psychologist because my last one kept dismissing. 

Anyway, I'm not sure what replies I'm expecting. Maybe if anyone else feels the same way, or can give me a name to what I'm feeling. Is this an ASD thing, bipolar?  Since my ADHD diagnosis I've suspected I might have ASD. 

That's about it.",1,asd
"I’m horrible explaining myself and will try to make this short as possible. 
About 5-6 months ago, I began continuing on my mental health journey with a new psych N.P. my PCP recommended after our move to a new state. I’m diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD, and have been for years (I’m 39). She started/continued some meds, but after the third month, she didn’t want to adjust these meds because I had “too much going on in my life”. I am trying to separate from my covert narcissist partner and father of our two young children, but I didnt understand why she’d change her tune after life simply happening as it unfortunately can. I’m an emotional and empathic person (I cry), but I’m also incredibly strong. She originally knew of these struggles, and also stated meds may need to be increased if needed. I was prescribed adderall and vyvanse in the past, but only wanted to start on a low dose of vyvanse and chosen not to start adderall. 
After reading reviews, some called her a “pill pusher”, among other things, and she was fully out of network. Now, I know this does NOT mean much, and there’s plenty of incredible physicians out there that choose not to deal with insurance companies. And for good reason. 
I’m simply trying to make sense of this.
Our appointments were only fifteen minutes, and fucking bet I cried when she asked me “how are things”. How could I not? Nobody asks this of me and I’m a sensitive wee soul… 
I tried to talk to her about this as carefully as possible, but it just seems strange to me. 
But, I’m also NOT  mental health physician, so that’s why I ask. Many thanks for any advise",1,

M/36 - Throw-away account, for reasons.
TL;DR ""I feel fucked"".

I'm seeking assistance. I've previously received diagnoses for ADHD, Anxiety, and Major Depressive Disorder dating back to 2018 (DD is now moot). Additionally, there was an assessment of Borderline Personality Disorder after a traumatic episode in 2021, when I made multiple suicide attempts within a day, leading to my hospitalization in the local psychiatric unit. This wasn't the first time I've tried to end my life; during my pre-teen and early teenage years, I attempted hanging myself. Remarkably, I survived that attempt because the twine I used to secure myself to a steel beam, gave way due to my weight and probably the sharpness of the beam during my struggles.

In preparing this post, I've turned to the ICD-11 for insights into my well-being and will be using it for my upcoming appointment(s) with Psychiatry and a referral to a Neurologist. That being said; I understand that I may have a deficiency in my ""general understanding"" of the diagnostic processes, and admittedly have a whole host of executive functioning issues.

This information I've gathered contrasts with the DSM-V, which lacks depth and predominantly focuses on symptom management, often inadequately addressing intricate comorbidities. Yes, I have a copy.

I mean ""Likert Scales"" are highly insufficient for capturing the intricate bi-lateral wave-functions in bodily interactions. Although, I do understand that increasing the complexity of diagnostics will overwhelm those unfamiliar with trait relationships and their long-term consequences.

I've easily dedicated well over 3000 hours to research and cognitive development in the area of mental health, engaging with tools such as counseling CEUs (AllCEU's - Dr. Snipes) on YouTube, content by other individuals with similar diagnoses, or experience with diagnosing, and the exploration of the various traits.

This document outlines the influence, or so I hope, of my potential underlying neuronal connectivity issues, arising from genetics and intergenerational-developmental trauma. These challenges have intensified over time due to insufficient support and understanding, leading to significant disruptions and quality of life degradation.

My journey has involved an incredibly diverse range of therapeutic methods (CBT, DBT, EMDR [tactile, visual, auditory bi-lateral stimulation], Psychotherapy, Exposure Therapy, et-al), which have mostly been self-guided, and at-times professionally directed. These methods concentrate on self-exploration and the cultivation of coping strategies for my daily challenges. Which I feel is important and needed for learning, validation and especially for the advocacy of my needs going forward with life.

My intelligence defies conventional neurotypical testing standards, in that I test poorly (5th percentile for my age-group at 36), but I can ""understand"" or figure out general concepts and connect them to their connectors and counterparts relatively easily. Lately, I've been exploring and employing the ""Feynman Technique"" to simplify complex subjects, necessitating continual updates to bridge knowledge gaps.


The traits listed below are the ones I've recognized as the most likely sources of challenges in my daily life. 

**Neurodevelopmental disorders**

**6A00.1 Disorder of intellectual development, moderate**

**6A01.1 Developmental speech fluency disorder**

**6A01.22 Developmental language disorder with impairment of mainly pragmatic language**

**6A02.1 Autism spectrum disorder with disorder of intellectual development and with mild or no impairment of functional language**

**6A03.1 Developmental learning disorder with impairment in written expression**

**6A03.2 Developmental learning disorder with impairment in mathematics**

**6A05 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder**

**6A05.0 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive presentation**

**Anxiety or fear-related disorders**

**6B01 Panic disorder**

**6B20 Obsessive-compulsive disorder**

**6B41 Complex post-traumatic stress disorder**

**6B44 Reactive attachment disorder**

**Disorders due to substance use**

**6C40 Disorders Due to Use of Alcohol**

**6C41 Disorders Due to Use of Cannabis**

To some extent, I've predominantly turned to cannabis as a means of moderating my behavior, and I've harnessed its effects on dopamine to strengthen positive routines, such as tidying up my living space or ensuring I stay adequately hydrated.

**6C48 Disorders Due to Use of Caffeine**
By inhibiting adenosine, it actually aids my sleep onset.

**6C4A Disorders Due to Use of Nicotine**
Hate it but can't seem to quit.

**Disorders of autonomic nervous system**

"growing up i was constantly put on and taken off of meds because of my trauma, depression, and anxiety. i have been on and off meds since i was 5 or 6.

on those meds i developed a ed of eating too much and an ed of eating too less.

i would get overweight on one medicine, then once i get taken off i would dramatically lose weight.

i am 14 now and i finally have meds that help me and balance everything out.

in march i was hospitalized for self harm and not eating. i ate full meals in that hospital and the food was great. when i got out i ate 3 meals a day daily, but slowly fell back into not eating.

i told my psychiatrist about it, and she said it may be a side effect of my meds. im on vitamin D, cymbalta, seriquil, and vyvanse.

i dont think its side effects from those meds though.

i currently eat, but not enough. i don’t have a appetite and i force myself to eat but not enough.

its making me paranoid.

why do i keep falling in and out of this ed?",1,
"
I’m (34m, 5’ 10, Hispanic) on my third year of taking 0.5 mg of risperidone daily (split into two 0.25 tablets that I take together around 3pm every day) for nervous tics in my face, shoulders, and diaphragm. Since I’ve been on it, the tics have all but gone away and I feel generally calmer when I’m on it, which is great. 

However, I’ve gained about 15-20 lbs since I started it despite being very active (I either go running for 20-30 min or lift weights at the gym for five days a week). I do ok with eating smart for breakfast and lunch each day but get an uncontrollable appetite around dinner time and end up pigging out for dinner almost every day. I feel like no matter how much I exercise, I can’t get rid of my belly fat and I feel like my pecs are holding more fat than they used to (prolactin?). I’ve also noticed on more than a few embarrassing occasions that my sex drive has decreased and erections are either hard to maintain or finishing is harder than it used to be. I look back at pictures before I started risperidone and my face would look much more defined/skinnier, despite keeping the same exercise regimen.

When bringing these things up to my psychiatrist, he says that I am on a very low dosage already and implies that those side effects are either exaggerated or that I should be able to manage them better. 

I like what risperidone does in that it controlled my tics and I feel less irritated when on it…but frustrated with the side effects and I feel like it’s affecting my confidence in my love life and dating. 

My question is- should I stick with the dosage and work harder to combat the weight gain/low libido with other natural solutions? Should I split the two tablets into morning and afternoon instead of taking together? Should I ask for a lower dose or a different medication all together? I tried lowering my dose one day on my own (bad idea) and noticed immediate irritability and nervous tics…

For reference- I also take 75mg of Zoloft for anxiety and 30mg of Vyvanse for ADHD daily as well. 

Thank you for reading a very long post and I appreciate any advice",1,"nervous, ##ics, irritability, nervous tics"
"Hello! I have been taking adderal for the last couple years. It really was a great medication. It helped with my depression,my anxiety, and with paying attention. I recently quit taking it because I moved and I can't find a doctor to prescribe it. It's controversial because it's addictivr. My current doctor is only open to non narcotic stuff.

Right now I'm taking Wellbutrin 100mg, Gabapentin 100mg, and Depakote. I'm feeling good. But it's not enough. I feel not even close to what I feel on adderal but I DID do a music project today. Music projects are very tedious and I absolutely never am interested in them unless I use stimulants. I want that spark that I get with adderal but I want to find an alternative. 

My doctor is open to possibly adding cymbalta in the future. I've taken that before and it's OK but the side effects outweighed the benefits. Bad sexual side effects. 

I was thinking Concerta maybe. It's a warm rush without the euphoria. It keeps me from being sleepy during the day. Or would he be open to vyvanse since it isn't quick release or will he deny it since it's still a stimulant? I'm trying to be reasonable but they are all very stern here in California about any sort of addictive medication. I'm hoping he will meet me in the middle eventually because I really just want to help myself. Genuinely. Okay well comments are MUCH appreciated, thanks in advanced!!

"2 weeks ago, i went to an inpatient program at a nearby hospital bc i was overmedicated. I was on vyvanse, pristiq, and ativan. I was actually in the process of being weaned off of Ativan bc it has the opposite effect on me (it doesn’t relax me at all, it just makes me sad and anxious) when i woke up my first day, i felt a little homesick and anxious. I went up to the nurses desk and told my nurse how i felt. I honestly just needed someone to sit down with me and tell me everything was going to be okay, but instead, he handed me an antipsychotic (haldol) and the rest of the day i felt SO weird. I don’t even know how to explain it, but it definitely made my anxiety skyrocket. The next day, i woke up and ate breakfast with some of the others. I noticed my neck muscles started to seize up. I was so scared i didnt know what was going on but i tried to move my head back into its original position but it kept going back. So long story short, a nurse brings me to the nurses desk, they explained that its a side effect of haldol and they shoot me full of Benadryl to cancel out the effects. Luckily it got rid of it but also wtf. After that i lost all trust in the staff. My body kinda went into survival mode for the rest of the time i was there. i was SO anxious everyday just waiting to get out. I realized the quickest way out was to put a smile on my face and pretended like i was happy and fine. Most people there were there for anxiety, and these “professionals” didnt even know how to talk to people with it! The psychiatrist preached about “coping skills” over and over but when i ask about my discharge she’d be vague. Even the day before my discharge i asked “whens my discharge” and she said “if things go according to plan then tomorrow” like ???? If your patient has anxiety, you need to be clear with them!",1,
"i’ve really been struggling for the past 3 years, especially recently, when it comes to my mental health. since i was 12 years old (23 now), i’ve been going through very stressful situations & a lot of trauma. in 2021, i was diagnosed with graves’ disease & had my thyroid removed. this past december, i was viciously attacked by a pitbull & was scalped- leaving my skull exposed. following this, i was diagnosed with epilepsy & pots because of my nervous system constantly being in survival mode since the age of 12. i feel like i’m falling off the deep end and just don’t know what do or where to turn. 

i’m on a bunch of medication due to my health issues which came into the picture as of recent. i am on synthroid, vyvanse, lamictal, duloxetine, remeron, birth control, & the occasional propanolol. i also take vitamin d3 and iron for past deficiencies which are now fixed as well as my thyroid levels being normal. 4 weeks ago, i was put on keppra for my epilepsy & had an adverse reaction, causing me to begin lamictal instead about 2 weeks ago. i know i’m experiencing the effects of keppra still because they take two weeks atleast to wear off, but this feeling started long before. 

my biggest struggle is that every morning, i wake up and literally can’t move or get out of bed until my vyvanse kick in. still, when they do, i’m extremely tired, im depressed, my thoughts are running a million miles an hour, i’m constantly stressing about everything i need to do and then i’m overwhelmed with guilt because i’m not doing those things, just stressing about doing them. if it were up to me, i could sleep for three days straight and still..ALWAYS tired. whether i get 7 hours or 14 hours, i wake up with a feeling of dread and exhaustion. i have no interest in doing anything at all. bullet journaling has been my escape especially lately because i can’t work due to health issues & the dog attack. i have no interest in even this. i just feel stuck, frozen, sad, angry, everything. when i leave my house (i can’t drive, so with others) i’m overwhelmed, overstimulated, irritated, snappy, just overall not a fun person. i’m grieving the person i was even a year ago because she had so much life in her & so much freedom. i just feel way too young to be this sick, this tired, and this burnt out. 

i’m not looking for sympathy & nobody’s struggles are bigger or smaller than another’s. i know we all go through things and i’m hoping this is just a rough patch, but i really needed an outlet and safe space to release these feelings, possibly gain advice, and hopefully hear similar stories. i’m sorry this is so long, but i really needed this. thank you to anybody that takes the time to read & respond. my messages are always open if anybody needs someone to talk or vent too. mental health is the ugliest disease & im sending good vibes & energy to anybody who may be struggling. <3",1,
"**preface-ish**

I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and psychiatrists have said which are on the spectrum of paranoia. I wasn't given a full diagnosis but they prescribed vyvanse to me to treat attention deficit disorder. 

It is hard for me to concentrate on what people are saying to me and i will often unknowingly think of random things when someone is saying something or i am reading but will continue listening/reading and its like i forgot that i was reading/listening to them. 

**sleep/anxiety**

It is extremely difficult for me to fall asleep at night and i will go nights without being able to sleep, this contributes to my anxiety. But in the daytime/when i shouldnt be sleeping i am constantly drowsy and tired and feeling like i need to fall asleep immediately, even if i do get a good sleep at night (sometimes i will sleep for 12+ hours at a time) i will still feel like falling asleep, and the feeling of having a good sleep doesnt happen often. To counter this i use the vyvanse, but it doesnt prevent me from this all the time (probably cause im used to it at this point) or i drink coffee (but i still feel tired but it like forces me awake but then i feel like absolute shit) 

**Vyvanse and “ADD” and fainting** 

I have been on vyvanse for 3 years now but i have taken months off of it repeatedly in that time, and go through bouts of taking it/not taking it cuz i forget to. 

I will note that i have “fainted” before, it happened once in february 2022. I walked to go to the bathroom, it was 1 am and i did not fall asleep yet, before i went into bathroom and got up my vision went fuzzy and black (happens often) and i went into bathroom this time and sat on toilet, i started getting black vision a little on toilet and i got up and it got worse, it went away completely when i was washing my hands but i looked in the mirror for a minute, noticing how blue my veins were on my body, on my chest, my arms my stomach, it looked to blue and prominent, i was worried and questioning if it was my mind playing tricks on me, i then started getting black and fuzzy vision again, and i felt dizzy, my vision went completely black (even though the bathroom lights were super bright) i held onto the sink counter and i guess my legs gave up and i fell foreward and hit my head on the counter but i somehow managed to also fall backwards hitting my head on the bathtub wall thing (slide in doors) i stayed there on the ground in pain until my vision came back to me and i looked in the mirror and a giant cut on eyebrow/inbetween eyebrow area (i have a scar there now) i went to emergency room and they said it was from dehydration, i understand i have a problem with drinking enough, i have always forgotten to drink enough water throughout the day, but i was drinking (slowly) a diet pepsi before i “fainted”. My vision often goes black when i get up, but ive had bloodwork done and it seemed a little on the low iron side but nothing to be concerned about they said. 

**anxiety**

I have bad anxiety and paranoid thoughs especially at school, its hard to do work or pay attention there because in class im constantly thinking about others perceptions of me and how my actions and appearance are perceived by people, always thinking people are out to get me.

This causes me to shake in class and its hard to move normally or sit still because i cant stop twitching/shaking. I get very stressed about doing perfect on assignments but i still neglect working on it and procrastinating. I get very scared when im away from my mom, when she drives somewhere i get sick feelings and nervous she will get into an accident, when we drive together im also very scared too, often when we are driving at night and theres lots of transports on the road when they come near us i think to myself in my head “oh no, i dont want this song to be on in case we die right now. I want it to be a good song.” or “i lived a good enough life, im not scared if we die right now, i love my mom, she loves me, and i am happy. I am loved”

**focus**

My focus has caused me to get in fights with my mom because she wants me to do my work, and im focused on everything under the sun but my work, even though the work is constantly on my mind as a stress. I feel i am too open and act inappropriate when excited and i will act ridiculous/always joking. Often when my mom is having a conversation with me about something serious or she is expressing frustrations i will notice an awkward silence of us of a pause, or the way she looks at me, or my dog looks at me or i just think of something random, and i will smile and then start laughing hysterically, this happens in class sometimes too or during important things and it has caused a lot of trouble in my life. It feels like i have no control over this. I notice it happens often when im stressed or anxious. 

**dreams**

My memory isnt very good, and its hard to remember my dreams, but when i do, they are extremely disturbing or just nightmares: embarrassment, scary people from childhood, school shootings, drive by shooting, sexual assault, kidnapping, car accidents, bad things happening to loved ones. If its not a nightmare, which is very rare, its just a weird dream where im doing something (example, trying to jump on rocks, or lillypads in a water part obstacle course type thing, but with a constant feeling of anxiety that someone behind me can see my crotch area) with disturbing undertones, ive never had a good dream that i can remember before.

**dreams**

I have been trying to lucid dream, so ive been trying to write my dreams down so i remember them (this has helped me remember dreams i have had like ive remembered 4 or 5 this past month, whereas if i didnt actively try, i would maybe remember 1 dream in 6 months, but vaguely) some highlights were having a dream seeing my male cousin have anorexia and me asking if hes okay, and the dream i had last night (november 19 2022). The dream i had last night felt like sleep paralysis: i was in the same spot i was in that i fell asleep, in that same spot and it was also dark and at night, it looked exactly like the house and living room and couch i was sleeping on(my mom and devin were home in real life) but in the dream i was under the impression they were gone, i was also under the impression that i was awake or awoke in the middle of the night and i look at the front door, i see it open and close but dont see who (or if anything came in) i was really scared and i could think in my dream, i wanted to get up and say something to whoever it was. I heard noises that sounded like my grandma (i dont like her, i dont talk to her anymore its been a year) she came into the living room saying how much she loved and missed me and kept saying things like that. (now im not sure if i was talking or if i was just thinking these things, but i remember asking how did you find me why are you here but she kept ignoring me) she went on top of me and kept acting disturbing and excited to see me, she was touching and squeezing my sides of stomach arms legs. I felt so scared and asked her to stop, i was feeling super ticklish and it was overstimulating and felt unbearable. And i kept (i think) saying get off and stop. But i remember then thinking to myself “this is just a dream. Blink to wake up. Wake up!!!!”  i woke up. I remember similar has happened to me around age 10 a few times by “old hag women witch things”. I am trying to learn to lucid dream so i can recognize im dreaming and wake up, also to try talking to myself to see why i am so anxious all of the time.

Every time i go to sleep (sometimes i remember doing this when i wake up) i hear screams or random voices but usually yelling/screaming, or just saying random words or crying. And i see kaleidoscope patterns or random paintings moving and transforming or random scenarios of people/places that are very vivid but the auditory sounds i hear don't match the visual things i see, right before i fall asleep. I have told a psychiatrist this and they said that is common for people right before falling asleep/waking, lately its been increasingly harder to fall asleep when i should so i try playing into these “hallucinations” i try to let them come on more naturally and let my mind wander more now because ive found it helps me not think and sleep faster.

**Sleep problems**

Its always hard to sleep when i want to at night (unless im super tired) because im always thinking and its difficult to stop or redirect my mind towards thinking of something that isnt stresses or anxieties i have (hard to think happy things). I dont usually ever wake up in middle of night that i know of, but last night i did, but its easy for me to fall back asleep. Its hard waking up in the morning, i usually sleep through my alarms, (like it will keep ringing but i wont wake up, this has caused people i live with, landlords, roomates, staff im living with, etc. they are annoyed with me.) i will sleep through my alarms usually for like 8-15 hours, often i wake up at like 4 or 5 pm and feel horrible that i did. It feels like i have no sense of night or day. Even if i get a “decent” sleep at night i will feel horribly tired/drowsy at school, even when i was a freshman. It used to be bad, i used to fall asleep in class and would sleep in the guidance office at lunch. Its a battle when i get home from school, because i feel like falling asleep right away, its hard to fight these feelings so i often do sleep. I often wont sleep at night because im scared of when i wake up. I have fallen asleep at work before, like last month i slept on the floor for a few hours and woke up super sore. And another time i slept in the chair but it was harder to get comfy (its hard to sleep unless im on my stomach in a certain pose, but i had that “grandma nightmare thing” when i had to sleep on my back (super rare for me) because my dog was in between my legs. I can control staying up for the most part but sometimes i cant, and if no one (like a boss/coworkers/my mom) is there to stop me i will sleep even if i know i cant. 

**At my wits end**

I want to fix this, i want to go to counselling again or see a psychiatrist again, its been since 2019 that i really talked to one and got an assessment of anything. I hate taking medication, i was on zoloft (was on it on and off) but stopped, i was on sertraline but stopped because of weight gain, and i am on and off with vyvanse but have been taking it for the longest period consecutively ever (little over a month). I dont want to be medicated but if it will actually help me at this point without horrible side effects im willing to try again. I would like to get some tips from a counsellor to help cope with these feelings so i can be more productive in school and finish highschool and get ahead in life. And maybe learn strategies that i can actually stick with, i want a routine for my life, a structure. I constantly try to make them for myself but they last less than a week till i forget. My life feels like its going downhill fast and i need help.",1,black vision

i work in a restaurant as a cook. and for the past week or so. i’ve just been so unmotivated to do anything. i wake up, put my laptop on my bed and watch netflix all day. most nights i don’t even sleep, or i just get like 2 hours of sleep. i don’t get out of bed for anything other than work, food and water. i’ve never felt like this before. i feel empty, lost, confused, i just don’t know what to do with myself. i have no friends, my hobbies like gaming and fishing don’t really interest me as much at the moment. i don’t do anything. my friends message me and i make excuses to not talk to them i just don’t want to. i told one i was admitting myself to a MH just to get them to leave me alone for a week, and most of the time i just tell them that i was napping when really i just ignored their messages. im just lost. today i went to drop my mom off at the office with my dad. and we drove past my great grandmas house and her neighbourhood and the park and the butcher shop and the corner store she used to always take me and my cousin to when she babysat us all day. every day. and she died a while ago and it just made memories flood back. and i just started bawling. i miss being that young and innocent and not having to worry about money or school or friends, or girls. i think my life is going to shit. i’ve been watching a lot of shameless lately. and it sounds dumb but i think it’s signs of bpd or depression, but if it’s depression i don’t even know what i’m depressed about. i have nothing to be sad about. i have a roof over my head, food, a job, steady income (sorta), and a loving family. i have nothing to be sad over. im confused and scared. 

im scared to tell my parents or my pediatrist how i’m feeling because i don’t want to be sent to a mental hospital, or anything like that. i just want to be happy. and i don’t know how my family would take it. i also haven’t had the motivation to shower or shave in the past few days

if anyone has any opinions/advice/wake-up call/grow the fuck up/medical advice. shoot them in the comments. if you have any questions for me to help you understand better or help me understand better, shoot away. where else am i gonna go. i just need help and i needed to get it off my chest. yes i’ve been to therapists many many many times before none have ever helped.

TW: no i do not want to hurt myself or self destruct myself. i never have and don’t plan on it.

EDIT #1 
I have opened up to my mom about it, she says it’s most likely depression since anxiety and depression go hand in hand. and as she was diagnosed with depression. i have called my pediatrist and she will call me back later tonight. thank you for all the advice and kind words i appreciate it!",1,
"I apologize for the long description but I'm struggling and I really need help. I have struggled with functioning in day-to-day life since I was 13. I have been put on a plethora of medicines, but nothing seems to push me over that mental block. I currently take Prozac which helps my mood exponentially and I take Vyvanse which helps my brain quiet down, but I'm still struggling. When I say I can't function properly or consistently I mean that I struggle to keep up with or even do menial tasks. My laundry is never done. When I actually do my laundry it either sits in a basket in my room for weeks, but most of the time I don't even finish washing all my clothes, and the basket of laundry sits in the washroom for days. I struggle with eating enough. I feel like I have no energy to make myself food so I eat 1-2 small meals a day. I do online school because I had to leave my in-person school because of my mental health. I have felt no form of desire or motivation to even complete work at all. I'm missing 80 assignments right now. I struggle with waking up in the morning because I have terrible insomnia that either keeps me up until 4-5 in the morning or if I do fall asleep I wake up almost six times a night.  My room is insanely messy. I can barely walk to my bed. I've also struggled with substance abuse in the past as well as self-harm and suicidal ideations. I was also admitted to a mental hospital last year. Since then I've been trying to get my life back in order, but I can't seem to get it right and it is really upsetting me... I don't want to fall back to the place where I was last year. I really really want to become a responsible person so that I can function as an adult. I feel like I make small bits of progress every now and then, but I always end up failing and I'm afraid this sense of failure will push me back to old habits like drugs and self-harm. I want to change because I am not the person that I want to be and I am not currently the person I know that I can be. I would love some insight if anybody has anything. I think the only difference mentally between me now and last year is the fact that I have people who love me. I now have friends and even a boyfriend and I really want to step up with my responsibilities so that I don't let them down. ",1,
"Hi all. I'm a 40 year old guy and always suspected I may be a little neuro-divergent. I've recently been researching more about ADHD, and doing the online diagnostic tests. I'm finding some of the items match my experience but others really don't - so curious about whether this may be a correct diagnosis.

My seemingly matching behaviors are:

* I'm a generalist at work, and have a wide range of interests in my spare time - but often lose interest after going into depth. I suspect this has hampered my career somewhat.
* Long pattern of getting bored in romantic relationships after a few months - seeking novelty, and idealizing new potential partners. It's nearly always me who instigates the break up.
* Strong drive to do cardio exercise every day (in my case, an 18 mile hilly bike ride). After this I feel more calm, settled, and able to focus.
* Difficulty relaxing (e.g. on vacation, after the first day I'm usually making to do lists, making plans for the future, and seeking activity).
* Difficulty starting convoluted work projects if they don't interest me (likely to procrastinate).
* Often find group work meetings deeply tedious and often lose interest/withdraw.
* The risk-taking adventure and creativity of entrepreneurship appeals to me far more than a corporate job.
* Easily distracted - even while at work, I'm often opening a new browser tab to read the news, check Facebook, etc (almost by muscle memory). I'm often unproductive in open plan office environments.
* Sense of overwhelm and inaction in starting a new project - e.g. I've been planning to renovate my home for years, but the range of tasks and attention to detail needed puts me off. Currently seeing a therapist, but the thought of going through the process to find a good match put me off for years.
* Strong curiosity about the new - ""what would life be like if I lived somewhere else? was dating someone else? was doing a different career?"" etc) - and need to experience it first hand before forming an opinion.
* Ability to hyperfocus in some situations, e.g. computer programming or playing a video game. I enjoy the sense of flow and peace they bring,
* Strong draw to sunlight and the outdoors (previously lived in England, and this was a problem). Exposure to both heavily improves my mood.
* Enjoyment of fast cars and motorcycles, perhaps in search of stimulation.
* I can sometimes fixate on people, e.g. coming up with many (in my eyes loving/amusing) nicknames for them or idealizing previous romantic partners.
* I often have trouble retaining interest in long movies or TV seasons.
* Dislike of standing in line (e.g. when thinking about a trip, remembering the security line I'll face at the airport is often top of mind).
* Some history of mild depression and anxiety.

My behaviors that don't seem a match are:

* Academically successful across a broad range of subjects and well organized (e.g. doing homework on the day it was set).
* Pretty tidy and organized at home.
* Tend not to forget appointments.
* Don't talk over people.
* Have no trouble staying seated when that's expected.
* Usually hit deadlines if externally imposed.

Sorry this is a long list! In the online tests, I'm usually hovering in the mid-way ""some symptoms"" list but don't feel quite ready to put this aside. Would be very interested in any thoughts or follow up questions, to help me decide if this is something to investigate or not. Many thanks.",1,
" The way my experience is unfolding as I seek mental health care isn't making any sense to me. I just want to play this out step-by-step and get some input on what's going on here.  

* **I've had severe and ongoing anemia** for many years now. This causes me to feel very lethargic. My mood is fine (eg, I like doing social activities, I like people, I feel pleasure; though I struggle to initiate social connection and do enjoy my solitude), however I get tired easily as is typical for those with anemia.
* **I started a graduate school program and hated it.** Before the program, my goals were changing and I started to suspect the expensive program was simply not the right call for me any more. I was itching to do something else in a related field. Nevertheless, I started the program and begin the journey of incurring a shit load of debt (stupid? yes, I know). The result:
   * I tried to force prioritize my actual goals during the program. However the program is demanding. As a result, *I mostly burnt out quickly.* 
   * I was very unmotivated in the program so *my grades dropped.* I honestly didn't care too much, since grades are not super important for this graduate program.
   * Altogether, *I could not bring myself to concentrate on school tasks.* 
* **While in the graduate school program, I began seeking mental health care.** 
   * I wondered if I also had depression since I was tired all the time. I decided to seek out therapy. It's free for me after all. I cried during the session because I feel vulnerable as I'm telling this therapist sensitive information. The therapist referred me to a psychiatrist.
   * **I informed the psychiatrist that I had severe anemia and I was tired all the time, but my mood doesn't feel particularly bad**. Of course, I also hate school and felt like I was wasting time and money, so I wasn't particularly upbeat about that. But I genuinely didn't feel chronically ""sad"".
   * I actually really liked the people and the social activities, however the work load felt 5x more of a burden because I truly just didn't want to be in school. 
* The **psychiatrist prescribed me Wellbutrin** anyway. I start taking it and shortly after, I begin experiencing mild tactile hallucinations*. Psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, psychosis, concentration disturbance, paranoia, and confusion are a documented potential side effect of wellbutrin.*
   * After taking wellbutrin for about 3 months, I didn't feel any difference to my mood.
   * Every 2 or so sessions, I mention to my psychiatrist again that I have severe anemia and each time he seems very surprised as if I am mentioning this to him for the first time. He'd then proceed to tell me he can't know what's going on with me while I have anemia. He doesn't take me off wellbutrin though despite me emphasizing that I am tired but not particularly ""sad"" except for the fact that school is annoying.
* During another session, I mention that I am struggling to concentrate. After me dropping 1-2 sentences max on my struggle to concentrate, **the psychiatrist recommends a stimulant combo of vyvanse and adderall for ADHD**. Over the 3-4 months while on Vyvanse/Adderall and Wellbutrin, I start experiencing:
   * Insomnia: On average I was getting 0-4 hours of sleep a night. This later brings up concerns about if I'm developing hypomania.
   * Worsened rumination / racing thoughts: Usually this involves me mentally looping the same bothersome scenario, talking out loud to think through the scenario, overanalyzing and not finding a resolution. 
      * I don't hear voices. I do express myself outloud when I think, particularly if I have a lot of thoughts.
   * Visual effects: photo flashes, looks like something flying past me but when I look, it is no longer there. I wasn't sure if these were floaters since they disappear when I try to look at these directly. I also notice visual snow and that sometimes the floors look like they're moving (not literally, but similar to a an optical illusion like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=optical+illusions+movement&tbm=isch)).
      * The less sleep I get, the worse the visual effects. 
   * Debatable effects on my concentration level. I can sit still for longer, but I'm still not particularly inclined to do work I find uninteresting. I also just feel cognitively slow, even when I'm not distracted.
* **My psychiatrist starts to concern me.** I tell him about the vyvanse/adderall side effects and he tries to put me on Haldol, an old school antipsychotic for schizophrenia. I start trying to google it and he says ""If you look it up, you won't take it...... ok nevermind, you won't take it. Forget about it.""
   * These just seems weird to me now. I feel like he's not doing any meaningful diligence before making recommendations. 
   * He tries to change my prescription to pristiq while weaning me off wellbutrin, but after taking it for 1 day and have weird side effects, I decided I would actually just stop antidepressants for a while and see if I feel any different
   * He also continues to forget I have severe anemia.
* **Since this process of seeking care was confusing for me, I decided to get a neuropsychological evaluation.** It's covered by insurance thankfully. 
   * I tell the neuropsych evaluator about my experience. He insists that I am depressed because I am tired often and I take wellbutrin (prescribed by a very inattentive psychiatrist who seemed to just be throwing stuff at the wall)
   * I also tell the evaluator things that I suppose could *kinda* sound delusional. For example, I received an envelope from Amazon that was wrapped in white powdery substance. I then texted a sibling jokingly about this and told him that the only reference to ""white powdery substance"" in envelopes I could find was related to anthrax. And clearly, many other people receiving these Amazon packages for the first time thought this was weird as the posted about it / it made the news: [https://www.google.com/search?q=amazon+package+white+powder](https://www.google.com/search?q=amazon+package+white+powder)
* Now that school is out and I can take some time to process my needs better, **I decided to take things into my own hands and wean off all medication:**
   * I wean myself off antidepressants and after over 4 months, I don't feel a decline in my mood.
   * A few weeks after I stop wellbutrin,  I also decide to get off vyvanse / adderall since the insomnia is really getting to me at this point. After getting over the initial crash from stimulant withdrawal, I feel totally normal. I'd even say my concentration is **better**, however that's probably in part because I am out of school for the summer and I'm doing interesting work.
* Many weeks later, I get my neuropsychological report. The report summarizes that I have schizoaffective disorder largely because of psychotic symptoms following wellbutrin / adhd stimulants and the fact that I related white powdery substance to anthrax.. **And that just doesn't feel right to me.**
   * This feels like a terrible gauge. And in general, there was no meaningful diligence. I kept thinking the evaluator would ask more questions that would offer deeper insight. 
   * The tests also didn't show I had any issues with attention. I did have significant issues with things like spatial memory (maybe why I'm horrible with street directions) and motor coordination ( I guess my chiropractor did say one leg is longer than the other...?).
   * The evaluator basically asked me questions like ""are you depressed""? Like dude.... that's partly what I came here to find out.....?!?
* **In summary, I think I just 1) Have severe anemia, 2) Hated school, 3) Received unnecessary medication that induced worse symptoms that I started with.** 

However, **I'd love some second takes.**",1,"mild tactile hallucinations, delusions, hallucinations, psychosis, concentration disturbance, ##noia, schizoaffective, psychotic symptoms, anemia"
"i’ve been experiencing painful brain zaps the past week or two. it feels like my brain is being stabbed by electricity. my vision has been blurry, i’ve been dizzy, and my brain just HURTS.

"I've been taking Vyvanse, and ADHD stimulant, for about a month, in a very small amount. Today is my first day trying double my normal dosage, though it is still a relatively small dose. So far, I've found that I've been louder, more assertive, and less anxious or perfectionistic. However, I've also been pissed for no reason, which is only unusual because I am a pretty chill, gentle, and self-conscious person. If something happened or someone was rude to me, I would normally either be silently bothered but do nothing or find it comedic. I usually have basically unlimited patience, especially with kids, but right now I definitely do **not.** I keep clenching my jaw, flexing and bending my fingers aggressively, being kinda unthankful and inconsiderate, snapping at people, and I am ONE FKING SECOND AWAY FROM SNAPPING MY LITTLE SISTER INTO TWO PIECES. I don't even have a real reason to be angry right now, it's just that my siblings are being a little loud, and IT IS SO ANNOYING. Why is this only bothering me now??? Also, I think it has made me feel significantly more narcissistic. And my attention span is shorter and I'm pretty impatient. Is this the Vyvanse? It is kind of pretty abnormal for me, even on a, 'bad day.' I do not like this. Will it go away or is this a permanent thing I'll have to deal with if I keep taking Vyvanse, if that's what's causing this? We just got it changed and it will be a month before I talk to the psychiatrist.. Do I need to keep taking it for the rest of the month?",1,
"For about a couple months now I’ve noticed some weird things about my mood I guess you could say. I’ll be super excited or happy and In a good mood about the day and all the things I wanna do and try. That could be getting into meditating, drawing, etc.. or if I have plans with friends or whatever. I’ll be genuinely excited about my life or that day then I’ll think about how the day is gonna go by fast or how much work, etc it’s going to take and instantly loose that good feeling in literally 2 seconds. My day will be shitty. It can even be something small like “okay I’m going to be social today and start conversations at work” (I’m pretty shy) and get so excited then get there and it goes downhill and I’m not feeling it anymore. It’s so annoying and I have no motivation to do anything because of it. I feel like I’m missing things from my life and feel empty/unsatisfied a lot. 

I thought it could be something to do with my medications (Luvox and vyvanse for ocd and adhd) but I just don’t know. Does anyone experience this ..?",1,
"I've been going to therapy for the last year, primarily to try and be a better husband and father. We're focused more on my wife than the kids though for whatever reason. I was abused one way or another as a child and had to grow up fast, but I wouldn't say that I had a hard upbringing and I made all of the logical choices to ensure my success in life. To get back on track, it seems like i'm the issue in my relationship/family. Because of how I was raised, I have unfair expectations for people in general (just do it even if you fail, have dinner done by 5 or 6pm, pick up your dirty clothes, etc...). Other people's brains don't think like mine and I shouldn't expect them too and I do agree with that. I am a very blunt person, I like to make jokes about everything and unless the situation is dire, I don't take things too seriously but I do what I have to do, and I expect others to do the same. I don't like conversations that take too long and I get short tempered with my wife a lot because she goes into too much detail that I just really don't care about. It drives me insane. My therapist has been basically saying the whole love bank thing, and how I need to do better at listening and caring about my wife's feelings. I do care about my wife's feelings, I hate it when she cries, I hate it when she feels hurt, but I can only give so many \*\*\*\*'s. My most recent negative interaction with my wife involved her crying in bed at night because she had recently hut herself and it was bothering her and she couldn't get comfortable. I gave her my sympathy, I held her, I tried to give her advice of the position she should try to sleep in, but none of it worked. So, I basically said okay i'm done, you need to stop crying because it's annoying me and I need to sleep; I have work at 5am and it's almost 11pm. Personally I don't think I did anything wrong except maybe my execution of ending the situation. 

&#x200B;

Ever since talking to my therapist\[F\] I feel like she's taking my wife's side almost all of the time and that my expectations are too much. I get mad easily, i know i'm not the greatest father and husband, but I do try. My wife says I only buy her things when I think/know she's upset... which isn't true. I rarely buy her things and it just comes randomly where I want to buy her something special. I feel like I'm changing my entire identity and I hate it, I'm scared, and i can't help but think ""why was I born this way? Why couldn't I care more about people and their feelings? I'm a terrible influence on my kid's.""

&#x200B;

The F'd up part is that I KNOW that I'm not a bad person. I help anyone that I can. When a few of my friends were out of a place to stay, I let them stay with us for cheap. When my mother in-law needs help, I offer my assistance. My my wife's friends need guidance, a résumé, a place to stay, I'm there for them. Do I necessarily care about their situation? No, it's none of my business. But I do know how to be kind and supportive because it just feels like the right thing to do even if it puts me in a slightly difficult but manageable situation. 

I've tried multiple time to get my wife to go to college, get a degree in something, anything; I'll pay for all of it. But each time is the same, she quits. Her job? It was stressful and people there were toxic and she wanted to quit, so I let her. Although I bring it up sometimes like ""Oh your gonna get another job?"" I'm still supportive of her actions, because at the end of the day I just don't care enough. I wish she would take more interest in gaining a better accomplishment than being a mom. Their my kids too, but they don't define me. I told my wife I want to try and open a university; she ignores my attempts to talk about my plans. But when it comes to hiring a lawyer to help her fight for custody of our (my step) daughter, I'll dish out 5k easily. Plane tickets for the children to go back and forth for visitation? No problem, I got it. 

&#x200B;

I do so many things and all I want in return, if she's going to be a stay at home mom, do the laundry, have dinner ready, clean the house, take care of the kids for the most part, and to just be generally submissive(?) (like not argue with me, if I say stop then stop kind of thing). I want to cry because no matter what I do, I always do something wrong and that's what apparently defines me.

&#x200B;

On the brightside, my wife just started therapy. But, and this kind of pissed me off, her therapist told her to focus on her own feelings and not mine. This was after I told her ""sometimes I really wish I could stab you"". I'll own that, It was so very wrong for me to say that even if we were arguing, even if anything. I don't want to actually do that, but at the same time I do (maybe she'll actually listen, maybe i'll finally get the quiet that I want so bad, but I know it's wrong to think that way as a human in modern society, but I also know that this is an archaic defense mechanism that our ancestors used to survive) I told my therapist about it (except my argument t why it's normal, i didn't want to argue with her about it). It is out in the open, not a secret because I WANT to be better. My therapist asked if I would ever do that to her, which I responded ""No, not that I'm aware of."" which she doesn't like because the answer should be No because we can control our own emotions. But to me it's the truth. I don't know what the future holds. I know how to walk away from a situation, I am not trying to ruin the life that I built and I especially don't want to scar my children for the rest of their lives. But what if I snap one day? It is not uncommon for people do things that they don't remember. What if that happens to me? How do I control that? My mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia in like her mid 30's, what if in the unlikely chance I develop it and become dangerous? Of course I don't want to but no one knows the future.

P.S. Im taking lamotrigine for depression and vyvanse for ADHD. When I miss my lamotrigine dose, I do get angered much easier.

If you read through this thank you. If you have any advice, please help me.",1,
"I was prescribed 30mg of vyvanse and started taking it around 25 days ago. For some reason recently I have had a sudden urge to not sleep. In the past 4 days I have probably had 3 hours sleep. I haven't been taking my quetiapine (for psychosis) as I take it before bed and since im not sleeping I'm not taking it. For some reason staying up, not sleeping, drinking tea (I prefer the tase of tea compared to coffee) to fuel my urge. It brings me a somewhat sense of euphoria. Not taking the quetiapine has made me abit irratic and paranoid, brining back  my auditory and visual hallucinations, but as soon I take the vyvanse and have some form of caffine I don't even care about them, just thinking of them as normal. know this is not normal and I am going to hopefully see my psychologist soon. Any advice would be helpful!",1,"irratic, paranoid, auditory and visual hallucinations"
"So I’m on vyvanse now. 40mg, mom wanted me to bump it up to 50 simply because my sister takes 50. I don’t want to do that for many reasons. First, I had a lot of people tell me personally that they had to get off vyvanse because they had side effects. When there’s a whole group of people that say what they’ve been through and all their stories sound very similar, there’s at least a shred of truth in there. Second, I think I’m at a good dose because I’ve noticed that I’m more focused now and whenever I feel like I need to do something, I do it. But my mom thinks that everyone takes 50mg which I asked my doctor about it and it’s simply not true. It’s actually 40 or less like what I take, and it’s a new drug so the research on it is probably only the bare minimum. So when I had my doctors appointment, we agreed to stay on 40. I told my mom about it and she accepted it and that was that. It got me thinking though, does she still think she’s a nurse? She used to be one but she quit so that she could focus on raising me and my sister. Even if she does think she’s a nurse, her registration and medical knowledge are both 2 decades out of date. Not only that but she suggested I do things about my medication which my doctor tells me he doesn’t recommend. She’s not toxic by any means. I love my mom but do you think she might be a bit delusional?",1,
"So last time I did Vyvanse I also had some of these episodes. I don’t know if it’s just seeing things due to being super paranoid and seeing things out of the corner of my eye like an arm reaching out for me, spiders, my cat buy dead just horrible things similar to this and it’s getting a little scary but it’s also a weird feeling. Holy shit never mind I take that bag it’s not “a weird feeling” its fucking terrifying. As I finished that sentence I just saw a dead baby walking. Like I swear I’m not making this up. Oh my fuck okay I’m getting super scared I keep seeing the same face everywhere I look. Guys please what do I do I’m actually fucking scared. Ugh I’m just gonna get through this with just starting at my phone. Ok last time I interrupt myself I just saw my blanket and i saw it as a my dog but dead…

Ughhh okay I’m not gonna do this any more I’ll just leave the things I saw after but anyways, I only took 2x 500mg weed gummies and 3x 30mg of Vyvanse. Is this meant to happen?? I’ve tripped on weed before, I’ve tripped on vyvanse before and I googled it to make sure mixing vyvanse and weed was okay and it said they don’t bother each other the two drugs but something weird I happening…

How can I get rid of the hallucinations or paranoia induced hallucinations either way I want it gone. And by the way I’m that period of time it took to write from where I said I stopped so I’m that period of time I saw at-least 15 Things move or shift into certain figures of the corner of my eye. Okay I. Feel like I’m losing it I’m literally having full on hallucinations. I don’t know hey but I k o seeing the face a guy keep appearing on the side of my bed and then when I look they just leave until my eyes can adjust to whatever im hallucinating.

Also 3 bonus Things…

Can lack of sleep cause these hallucinations? Because they went away for a bit but they came back suddenly and made me jump because it was so realistic. Also with the sleep thing I’ve being terrible at that because I’ve being using before bed and it keeps me up all night. 

my hallucinations are ranging from seeing the face pop up for less then a millisecond and seeing a different face pounce at my face out of no where and no it’s kind of getting scary. 

Can sleep deprivation cause very visual hallucinations because I didn’t sleep for a whole night on Wednesday then had Thursday and Friday off school and didn’t sleep until about Friday 8am and I woke up almost immediately after falling asleep (around 9:30am) and couldn’t sleep the next day on until around 10Pm and had a average sleep and now I’m wide awake because I’m high and it’s already 1am.

Ugh ok last paragraph, at this point I feel crazy and kinda embarrassed that I was about to wet myself in fear over a few pretty messed up hallucinations.

Is this from the drugs??",1,visual hallucinations

"Hi all,

Might be a tad long, but would really appreciate your support/thoughts on the below!

Background: I am a 27 y/o male with ADHD. Was on sertraline for anxiety last May and came off the drug completely late January.

On Sunday 29th May, I got married and it was the best day of my life - the amount of emotion and love I felt on that day cannot be rivalled. However, long story short, the day after I began to feel a bit odd: restless, anxious, maybe even a bit depressed. Thing is, I couldn't figure out WHY. I initially put it down to 'post wedding blues', but 11 days on and I can't honestly say that this is the case as I am not feeling sad about the wedding at all in my conscious thought. It would seem bizarre that after the best day of my life, I would feel so weird for days and even weeks afterwards.

Since last Thursday, I have been having sleep problems as well which makes my anxiety/palpitations worse. Getting off to sleep doesn't normally take too long, but i'll be up at around midnight, again at 3, and a few times in between, sometimes waking up wide awake as though I wasn't tired at all. Sometimes i'll have such a racing heart and i'll be sweating as well, with me then panicking about my sleep and how it'll affect me the day after: not ideal.

I spoke to my GP and it came up that I hadn't taken Vyvanse/Elvanse since Friday 27th May and she wondered if what I was experiencing was some kind of withdrawal affect. I wasn't sure because I was only taking 10mg/15mg a day and even then, I wouldn't say every day of the week either. So yesterday I took Vyvanse in the morning around 6:45 and by 9am I would say I felt normal again: still slightly anxious, but able to concentrate and speak to people and not worry about anything. But last night, I slept better, but still poorly. She recommended I take mitrazapine for this, but I remember taking it last year and it making me so so tired the day after - but worth a go again perhaps.

I am tempted to go back on Sertraline again, and the GP said that I could avoid the side effects I had last year as I had stopped taking it only 4 months ago - I don't why on earth I feel like this again, because nothing has happened in my life that is bad: objectively, things are great in my life circumstantially right now, but I need to be able to sleep and feel okay again.

I just wanted to see if anyone knew what had caused this possible chemical imbalance? i'm getting blood tests done today at the doctors to see if anything is awry physically. My wife is confused also by this, but is supportive all the same.

Thanks so much",1,chemical imbalance
"Hi, I'm 24 years old and have been in college for the last 6 years. This is common these days apparently, except I was not cut out for college and it's a miracle I've made it this far.  I'm a graphic design student so my finals season does not consist of tests. My projects this semester are large  
 in terms of workload and time. I have a senior thesis project, as well as a 5'x3' painting. I am   
behind in them. This is going to be a looooong post, and some of it is venting I do ask for guidance and encouragement if you have any though. I am also new to reddit in general so bear with me.

My first year of college primed me for a bad time especially I think because I was going through the worst of my PTSD mostly on my own. My disorders that have the biggest affect on performance are ADHD and SAD, and the OCD that has developed during the past year. The medications I take for these, Wellbutrin and Vyvanse, make it so I can be productive and not chronically exhausted, among other things. They also make it much, much harder to eat and exacerbate my OCD symptoms. They affect my sleep too, though I also ruminate. The graphic design major and OCD are sworn enemies. I also experience emotional dysregulation, and struggle with avoidance and self-esteem issues. I have Crohn's disease and arthritis as well. I consider myself disabled.  Now, to be honest, I think college has itself become a source of trauma for me.  Considering everything, naturally I would be more prone to stress. 

I had already struggled with some burnout, but it was the end of last semester that I realized finishing my degree might become something self destructive. By this I mean long-term physical/psychological ramifications, resulting in complete burnout and an inability to work. I also have a mad case of imposter syndrome. I have a therapist and psychiatrist, and we all agree that I need to finish college, which resulted in a medication decrease a couple months ago(so I would stop hyperfocusing on the OCD compulsions), and discussing the possibility of an SSRI. That did not happen because the med reduction did help quite a bit. However, I found it impossible to do work, and even harder to produce actual thoughts. We've talked through the imposter syndrome a bit too.

During the last month, I have started to experience what can only be described as feeling my nervous system, its kinda tingly, borderline zappy, which is deeply uncomfortable. This negatively affects my focus, emotions, and energy levels. I have recently discovered that it is probably a psychosomatic symptom of my worsening anxiety. Makes it harder to sleep too, and I become very aware of my pulse. My stomach also hurts more, I often feel nauseous, and in combination with the Crohns disease that is a bad sign.  So yeah, I have a whole sleuth of problems, and that brings us up to the past week.

I accepted that it was crunch time, and prepared for all-nighters and days of shrimping(curled up over a computer or painting). I was still uncertain I would be able to make it, but I had thought of some strategies to get me through it. I got some energy drinks and sbux cans of nitro. I also got cucumbers, clementines, mac n cheese, and chicken nuggets as provisions, since they are easy-to-make comfort foods that I will actually have an appetite for. This last Thursday, after realizing the nature of the nervous system discomfort and some of the bowel issues, I decided to take action by simply de-stressing. I played my kalimba and did some things because they made me more relaxed and happy, instead of doing those things to avoid work and discomfort. I figured if I could relieve my anxiety and crappy feelings, I would just have the back pain and sleep deprivation to deal with. This worked out nicely until the next day, when it turned into avoidance and some mild disassociation. I wasted all of Friday essentially, and my painting is due tomorrow. I am also alone this weekend, as my significant other went out of town Thursday for Easter. I am not usually alone for more than a day. 

So, to the subject of my post. I'm sorry it took me his long to get here. I have experienced some instances of paranoia in the past few months. I have become increasingly isolated. I'm in a constant state of stress. It is harder to sleep, and if I am tired I can barely be productive. I sometimes hear someone say my name, but I waved it off, as I would usually be at my barista job when this happened. I am often dizzy(even when laying down), and my vision blurs sometimes. I sometimes tune in to really quiet high pitched noises randomly. Because I avoided my work Friday and most of yesterday, I'm frustrated and extra behind, so I am extra stressed. 

When I got to working on my painting yesterday, things were going fairly well, but it took me while to realize I was hungry, and I was feeling weird and tired. I drank some water, finished my coffee, and made(and ate) some food. None of those thing helped very much, I still felt kinda hungry, my stomach started to hurt, I was more tired, and I started to think about my stress and think negatively. Before this I would occasionally hear clicking, which I would think about briefly then dismiss the thought. After this however, I would sometimes hear clicking and sounds of things moving, or like a house settling. I would think I saw movement in my periphery, only for it to be my reflection or just an object(like I was suddenly becoming aware of it).  Sometimes I would see little dots in my vision that would disappear. Some of it made me flinch, all of it made me anxious.

 I have always had the occasional image of a horrifying monster(s) being in my home, pop into my head(like The Rake or creatures from The Descent), but this time the images were more incessant and intrusive. I got increasingly more paranoid each time I heard a sound. More images of them being in the corner of a room, behind me, around the corner, in a mirror, outside of a window in the dark, behind a closed door. It wasn't so severe that I really believed there were monsters in my house, but I still felt scared and had a little ""feeling"" that something was in my house. Additionally, being aware that I have experienced this less severely when I'm alone at night combined with the fear that the stress of finals might break me...made me very upset about my brain betraying me. I was angry that it was doing so at the worst possible time. I also became even more anxious because it was threatening the completion that I am so close to. This made me more paranoid. I became scared that I would start hallucinating those creatures eventually, which would be a truly terrifying experience. 

I hugged my legs and made it so I was against a wall, and stared off into space, letting my vision blur, and tried not think about it. Eventually, I started to google early symptoms of psychosis, which I fit the bill for. I considered going to the hospital, but I haven't ever been committed to an inpatient psych ward. I looked into the ones around me, looked at their guidelines, looked up my rights, how to do it. Cried on the ground a little bit and begged my cat to come over so I could pet him so that I wouldn't be alone. Vaguely texted my significant other, he wasn't awake. I was still tired and thought that maybe if I go to my bed, which feels safe, I will feel better. It did soothe the paranoia a bit, and I kept researching. I thought about it more, decided to see how I felt tomorrow, and kinda just passed out. I felt really heavy inside, and emotionally tired too.

I woke up today, vision blurred again. Still tired, pulse is fast, and I have dark circles under my eyes, which I've only had a handful of times. I sat by my painting for a minute, texted my mom. She's a former caseworker and I haven't been extremely vulnerable with her in a while. Walked to the bedroom at one point, felt so dizzy I had to like sit on the ground, then I started hyperventilating. Went on a couple minutes. Still kind of have that ""feeling,"" but not nearly as bad as last night. I'm still scared.

 I have googled things very specific to my situation, and none of it is about personal experiences psychosis during finals. There's a lot telling me that stress is temporary, that it will pass, and to push forward. I agree to an extent, but stress also has horrible effects on the body and mind, I'm already traumatized and disabled, and I've been ""resilient"" enough to not drop out like I probably should have. It's lonely too, and I already feel lonely. College has made me bad at being a person and corrupted my relationship with art. I'm possibly on the verge of plunging into psychosis, it's not a matter of willpower. Why aren't people allowed to be weak? My brain is fucked compared to most people's, and 95% of that isn't my fault. I am going to have more trouble, and I can accept that! But why is weakness so much a sin in the eyes of the USA public that even thinking about giving up for the sake of one's mental health is something to be ashamed of? Like, seriously, I don't want to read peoples passive aggressive replies to someone asking for help over and over again, most of it is the same, so therefore redundant. Some diversity in solutions would be nice. I do want to get better, I am trying to change how I approach my work so that I can enjoy it, I try to practice self care. I'm just nearly at my breaking point.

I mentioned reaching out to my mom, and texting my significant other I think I will call both of them, and ask my mom to come be with me. Being alone right now is very difficult, earlier I was crying and just wanted a hug. My mom being a former case worker will also have more insight on what to do without immediately saying ""don't give up on college!!!"" without knowing the situation. I'm still considering the mental hospital, but that means I would have to disappear from classes(should I tell them I'm going if I do??), and I'd be extra fucked. I would need a note. I'm worried about mistreatment if I'm committed, and I'm worried about ableism from professors.  I don't know how much control I'll have really. I'm considering asking for an incomplete or two....or three, and luckily one of my professors already knows I'm struggling with OCD, but it's kind of humiliating. And they might say no because of the nature of senior seminar and senior studio. If so, I think it would be a minute before I attempt my final semester again, and it would put my full fledged career and plans with my SO on the back burner....again. My family, as supportive or ambivalent as they have been, might also be disappointed, and some of them will realize that I am much worse than they thought. Of course, none of that really matters if it means I get the help I need, but I don't know. 

**Questions and Requests**

I'm in SE Michigan, near Ann Arbor. Would a hotline help? If you know of genuinely helpful hotlines, please let me know. Tell me about your experiences of being voluntarily committed if you'd like. Hell, if you want, tell me about your experiences of being in a similar situation or having similar feelings. If you're in my area, and know what inpatient programs suck and which ones are overall good, let me know. Advice is appreciated, but if you really wanna tell me to not give up, offer another piece of wisdom too, or just keep it simple. I'm not currently struggling with suicide ideation so no need to worry there. Encouragement is especially appreciated. If you also struggled through college, but you're doing good now, feel free to share your journey. If you have other resources to offer, like articles, other posts, etc. please tell me about them. If you are also in college struggling and want to vent or lurk, feel free to. I just feel really alone in my struggle. You read my novella if you got this far probably, and I've been writing for like 2 hours, so thank you if you upvote or reply! I'm looking forward to hearing from people.",1,"##d, ##use"
"Hello everyone, so i have BED/ bullimia and my psychiatrist prescribed me with depakote, she said it should help me to stop binging. But i heard stories of how people gain weight on depakote because of increased appetite/cravings. Then how could i get prescribed with this? Should i look for a different psychiatrist?",1,"bed /, bullimia, gain weight, increased appetite, cravings"
"Y’all I am so upset and have no idea what to do. I have adhd and my adderall randomly stopped working. I have a psychiatrist and we tried upping the dose A LOT and nothing happened. The other day and I took my adderall and fell asleep. I am on 30 mg extended release. This use to carry me through my entire day until out of no where it stopped working. We’ve tried other stimulants like vyvanse and it’s the same thing - doesn’t work. I used to take vyvanse and it worked 100%. My psychiatrist has tried taking me off other medications to see if they are inhibiting my adderall from working, didn’t help. We’ve tries adding medications to enhance the effect of the adderall and nothing works. I was diagnosed with adhd when I was 15, I’m now 24, so I’ve been taking ADHD meds as needed for 9 years. (I’ve tried them all to find which works best for me) I’m very sensitive so drugs tend to have a big impact on me, and have never taken above 30 mg. Well when my adderall stopped working 4 weeks ago I thought hmm I wonder if I’m just getting a higher tolerance so I took 2 30mg ER. Nothing happened. I’m like okay this is really weird. I care deeply about my health and well being but I am neuroscience student and my curiosity got the best of me. I took 330 mg ER adderall in 1 day and NOTHING happened. I immediately told my psychiatrist and he has no idea how to solve this problem. I’ve been in contact with nearly every psychiatrist in California and no one has heard of this happening before and they have no idea how to help. Being medicated for ADHD is how I succeeded in school and got into my dream college and now I’ve had to drop 3 classes that I love because I’m not responding to my medication. I’m angry, upset, and feel like a failure.",1,
"I rarely use reddit and I've never posted before so apologies if this isn't the right place to go for this, but I need help ASAP. If anyone knows where a better place to ask for quick help might be please let me know.

I've been struggling with depression especially hard these past few months on top of having ADHD. My apartment is a horrible mess and I'm ashamed of it. There's rotten food in the sink and you can't take two steps without having to step over laundry or trash or groceries I haven't put away. It's a genuine health and safety hazard and if it weren't so bad I could handle it but it's incredibly overwhelming.

I'm having visitors in two days and I just want my apartment to be safe and presentable for them. Any tips on how to manage the load would be greatly appreciated.

I'd also like to note that I'm currently on Vyvanse so that's helping with the focus aspect of it.

EDIT: I've gotten it all clean! It isn't perfect but it was nice enough for my guests and it should be really easy to manage from here on out. Thank you for your tips, I kept most of them in mind and I got through it :) I'm gonna try not to let it get to that point again because I don't wanna subject future me to that kinda work again lmao",1,
"So i recently switched to Ritalin and anti anxiety meds because my vyvanse didn’t seem to work and even made me a little more anxious. It’s about day 6 on Ritalin + Anti-Anxiety meds and im finding that it’s really helping and im doing a lot better! But… today I noticed a few things that were off…

So it all started when I was at school and we had this big assembly and I was just sitting there like normal and then all of a sudden the writing on the screen (black writing with an white background) started look like it was moving. It’s really hard to explain but it felt like the writing was slowly twisting and turning and then everything but the screen started to turn black and all I could see was the distorted writing.

Sorry it’s really hard to explain but basically everything around the board just phased away and turned completely black and all I could see was the writing which at the time looked like it was distorted (almost like a vangough painting if you know what I mean) I also started acting weird. I started feeling really tired and clumsy and was bumping into things and tripping over anything in front of me. I also started acting weird like I literally jumping on my bed because I was bored and I’m currently watching kids shows while eating a huge bowl of cereal.

Idk what the f is up with me at the moment. Everything is the same like a usual day. I took my meds like usual, I’m not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol. Ok well I’m Done now and i really need help with this atm. Did this happen to anyone else? Like what’s going on??

Edit: Now I’m feeling really tingly and my belly feels like there’s nothing in it and I just feel almost like I’m high but I haven’t used any drugs?? I’m so confused",1,
"
I apologize in advance for how out of order this whole post is. It’s hard to organize my thoughts. Been medicated this way since December 2020, with the exception that I started at Adderall XR 30mg on and off 15 years ago and have tapered down in the past 4 months. This is because of uncomfortable side effects including compulsive cheek biting and cuticle trimming (that’s a thing right?) The cuticle thing has gone away, cheek biting not so much. Anyway, the past few months my house has been in disarray, I have been stuck to my couch, I have what I think is a phone addiction. My mental health however, in the past year has been vastly improved. I left my gaslighting husband around the same time I started the new meds.  So maybe that’s why I’m generally happier. I thought by tapering off the addy I’d somehow be able to rely on discipline, but that’s been a laugh. I want to get, like a life coach to kick my butt. Or learn how to be a normal adult unmedicated. I wonder if coming off the other meds would lift the fog I’m always feeling without the stimulants. I’ve been diagnosed with Depression and ADD since I was 12, admittedly I have had a very rough life and a childhood filled with neglect and living in squalor. My mother and siblings all have suffered depression as well. My siblings could be in the same boat I am. But my mother has had Manic Depressive disorder, drug addiction, alcohol addiction and depression all beginning  after having children. Mental disorders are genetic, right? I still have breakthrough depression, I can’t say it isn’t the effects of watching helplessly as life moves forward and I’m sitting in front of Reddit, uninvolved with the physical world. 

I just don’t know what is causing all of this mental anguish. Did my upbringing leave me devoid of healthy coping mechanisms? Doesn’t childhood trauma and neglect have far reaching effects? Is it possible to become normal through therapy and hard work? What should I change with my meds? Should I try a different stimulant? Should I increase my mood stabilizer or antidepressants? Is it my poor diet, my poor sleep schedule, the phone addiction? There’s so many variants and before you say keep a diary, I have gone 45 days without entering anything in Daylio (a mood tracker) because I’m so bad at consistency. 

And also, as a side note, I will have one part of something in my hand in one room where I need it, let’s say, a drill with no battery. I will take the drill into the room where I keep the battery, put the drill down, and walk back to the room with the battery and wonder where I left the drill. It takes me 10 minutes to do a 2 minute job. I know that I’m doing it, I say “god damnit, again??” It’s an issue I’ve struggled with forever and I still can’t organize myself enough to stop it before it starts! I feel so broken, I can’t clean my house because the above happens and while I’m motivated to clean for an hour I get maybe 10 minutes of results before I need a break. 

And tissues and dishes, I have a chronic runny nose. I can NOT throw tissues in the trash. I think well, I use a lot and I can reuse one tissue twice so I leave it on the counter. There will be hundreds of tissues in my house at any given time. And dishes, I will eat and walk away. I can’t can’t can’t remember to take my dish to the sink. I even look at it after I get up and be like, why aren’t you in my hands? 

I’m at the end of my rope. I don’t have great access to mental health resources. Don’t have much money. I have a new insurance plan, and I’m not sure how they plan on covering prescriptions. I’d really like to try the new Vyvanse to see if it eliminates my compulsive behaviors. 

Anyway, rant over. If you read this and picked out just one thing you have advice for, I really want to hear it. If you don’t have advice, but you’re anything like me, a “me too” would even go a long way. Thank you for your time 🙏",1,
"I took an IQ test around a year ago(the weschler intelligence test). Basically, my therapist told me my score was so odd(due to disparity in the sub scores) that she was unable to give me a final score. I got a 80 on the processing speed(apparently this is borderline retarded lol), around 100 memory, but the kicker—140(near genius level) verbal IQ. 

Therapist says she’s never seen such a large disparity, where one part of my intelligence is that of a savant while another is severely lacking. She suggested I used adhd medication(vyvanse) to help raise my processing speed.

It does make sense, in school I could read books and write papers for days, but almost failed math.

Verbal is actually 138 and “perceptual) is 98, processing speed 80: [from therapist report ](https://imgur.com/a/ISQJNkI)",1,
"So I already posted this in 2 other seperate communities but I just really need to let this out, again. 

So basically I was diagnosed with ADHD about 3 weeks ago and I was given 30mg vyvanse a day and after about a week of trialing it I found that it didn’t really work for me so I was moved on to Ritalin and I noticed small changes in my adhd and I feel like I have definitely gotten better but the thing is the doctors never took by the almost full bottle of vyvanse and it was just sitting there untouched….

Okay now before I get into this I have three important things to say:
1. Addiction runs in my family and pretty serious at times.
2. I am sorry to anyone who feels ashamed or let down by me and I completely understand.
3. I’m not sure if this will need a TW but just in case I’ll put one anyway 

⚠️TW⚠️: Drug abuse

So as I mentioned before those Vyvanse pills had being sitting there for about a week and I heard stories of people who had gotten high of vyvanse and had some great euphoric moments. So me being the person who can’t stand reality so much I would literally rather overdose on Vyvanse then face everything took 3x my usual dosage expecting myself to just be happy for a while… But it didn’t go as planned and I haven’t slept or eaten since last last night and it’s currently  8:15am and I’m wide awake and still hate myself and regret it.

Okay another few things I need to mention might trigger a few people and make me look like a horrible person.
1. I’m 14, 14 years old. I know I shouldn’t but I cannot stop feeling bad for myself even though I’m clearly in he wrong but like I used to be such a kind innocent and creative child now I’m a pathetic loser who gives people with adhd including me a bad rep and I feel so bad about it.
2. When I took those pills I wasn’t thinking about anyone else but myself. Especially not my family or the ADHD community.
3. When I posted on those other communities I told everyone that I accidnelty took 2 extra pills which almost sounds like I was blaming my adhd for it even though I chose to do what I did.

Ok anyways back to the story. I ended up having an overdose (not a real serious one but it still gave me a scare and it had a lot of terrible side effects like having one of the biggest vyvanse crashes I’ve ever had and almost every symptom there was for a vyvanse overdose. Oh and I cannot sleep at all.

The aftermath of me overdosing only really kicked in recently (like 2 hours ago) and since then I can’t stop hating myself for it like what was I thinking I could’ve had a bad accident or even died. I have a whole life ahead of me, I have a family like what the fuck is wrong with me that’s sos god dam selfish and ignorant to anyone who has helped me in my life.

But anyways I’m gonna stop writing now but I have two important things to say…
1. I might of being img a bit over dramatic, there’s wasn’t a big chance that anything bad would’ve happened but there was still that risk
2. (I know I’m being a massive fucking hypocrite but…) Never take advantage of prescribed meds given to you by a doctor. They have recommended dosages for a reason.",1,
"Hi, I've been taking Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) for almost 10 years now and I think it might be the reason why I'm having a really hard time with my motivation and my mental health in general. 

I'm diagnosed with social anxiety, ocd and a severe depression with psychotic features. I feel like the vyvanse isn't helping me with my adhd anymore and I barely feel the effects. However, when I doesn't take it I feel extremely miserable. I can't even get out of bed and even breathing feels like an incredebly hard chore to do. Obviously my depression isn't helping me feel better but I feel like it's not just my depression. I've been on multiple medication for it and none of them worked in the slightest. I've read that long term use of stimulant adhd med can have these kind of effect on one's motivation but right now I can't even imagine living without this medication at all. Even if my depression was  miraculously cured I don't think I could stop using it and feel normal.

Does anyone relate or can help me?",1,"social anxiety, ocd, depression"
Basically and this is very common on my amphetamine comedowns or during amphetamine use but essentially how it starts is I get this tightening sensation in my chest specifically where my heart is and slowly I also feel this pins and needles or tingling sensation in my chest as it begins to tighten and my heart begins to tighten then I start to experience tingling in my extremities more like pins and needles and this buzzing tingling sensation in my fingertips and feet while the tingling and tightness in my chest expands outwards until my whole chest is tingly and buzzing and numb and then the tingling in my fingers and feet move their way up towards the center of my body as well then I know what time it is at this point and I start try panic a little but try to maintain my breathe as much as I can and try to take deep breathes and all of that because the tightness in my heart and chest makes it harder to breathe then my heart will start to hurt a little and tighten a lot to the point where I feel like it’s gonna stop beating and my upper body and the rest of my body starts to experience these muscle contractions and my fingers start to cramp and stiffen considerably as my face and essentially the rest of my body gets this buzzing tingling sensation and my upper body tightens to the point where my upper body will be hunched over itself and also talking at this point will be very muffled and muted and raspy and basically just fucked up and at this point normally I’ll be on the ground in some type of fetal position and scared to die it’s really painful in it’s own type of way and extremely terrifying and normally I’ll be ready to call an ambulance because I don’t want to die especially not like that it’s horrifying and kolonopin will help a little and will normally help physically a little but I’ll still feel tightness in my heart and chest as well as the tingling completely in my face and fingers and feet and chest basically everywhere and my fingers might turn a dark purple blue like under my nails which will go away eventually but today the numbness and tightness in the chest and face as well as it being hard to talk and my fingers cramping up and taking on this claw like cramped state it’s just terrifying and I feel like I’m gonna die and I get anxious and panic a bit and this almost always happens on the tail end of my amphetamine highs like today after taking 140mg of vyvanse a few hours after taking it and on the comedown I got the warning signs and it slammed me today and shoook me up a lot because people are telling me it’s anxiety attacks but it feels exactly like what I’d expect a heart attack or cardiac arrest to feel like and  or a stroke and it scares the life out of me and I fear death everytime this happens so what is this? How should I handle them and when should going to the hospital be the right decision? Mainly though what is this?,1,
"Hey guys, I have reached a point in my life where I feel I have exhausted every potential treatment for the way I have always felt and continue to feel. Let me preface this by saying I'm a 25 yo male and am also a recovering poly addict/alcoholic. When I say I'm an addict/alcoholic I super mean it. I have been addicted to everything from heroin to benadryl, and everything in between (this info will come in later). Anyway, I just feel hopeless, constantly extremely anxious, depressed, restless, always on edge as FUCK, and just uninterested in everything while simultaneously feeling like a piece of shit for being so uninterested in everything and not being able to bring myself to do shit I know I need to do/should want to do. I don't have thoughts that I'd be better off dead or suicidal ideation, however, I do sometimes think how much of a chore it is dragging myself through a life where I find no enjoyment and have no desire/interest in anything. I have been on, and tried LOTS of different kinds of, anti depressants, mood stabilizers, benzos, ADD medication, etc. Pretty much anything you can think of, I've been on. Nothing seems to have really made a difference, save for a couple select SSRIs, benzos which do help with the anxiety, and vyvanse which does help with quite a range of my symptoms to an extent. Now here's where an issue crops up. The SSRIs that actually help always give me seratonin syndrome after being on them a short period of time. As for benzos and ADD medication, that's where being an addict comes into play. No matter what, every time I take benzos or amphetamines (anything that remotely alters my mood, really) it 100% of the time has lead me right back to full blown active addiction (and yes I have tried tons of other treatments for anxiety and ADD that don't have a ""mood altering"" effect, nothing comes close to really making a difference.) Side note, any one who's going to say something along the lines of ""wow you need to grow some balls and have some willpower, just take it responsibly,"" let me go ahead and save you some time. Fuck right on off, it's not that simple and if you think it is then you're speaking on something you have no understanding of. This is just my reality, unfortunately. I am in the program and have tried everything to get myself to where I can just use mind altering substances medically as directed and responsibly, this is not a possibility for myself and for majority of alcoholic/addicts so, moving on. I have also tried (and continue to try) many other non medication related programs and things to try and ease my symptoms. I have had some success but very, very, very little. At the end of the day, I suppose I do have some interest. I do earnestly wish to actually be able to find interest in life, whatever that may look like. I suppose I'm putting this out there to kinda get how I feel out somewhat so I apologize for the wall of text. Seriously, any suggestions/feedback would be appreciated. Thanks guys.",1,seratonin syndrome
"I'll make this post super simple as I understand long posts lose alot of us.

I'm 29/M

I've carried anxiety on my back for as long as I can remember.  Ive been on SSRIS for 10+ years but despite it helping me a bit, my scattered thoughts never calmed down. I always thought ADHD was was a term people use for a hyper child, but subsides as you get older and it stops there. Oh how I was wrong. I always felt I was just an anxious person with many ocd triggering thoughts and always being on the verge of a panic attack. realized my whole life Id shy away from certain projects and learning new things at work because I cannot retain information worth anything. I easily get impulsive on little things.  I never had good productivity at work as I'd get distracted way too easily and put off work until the last 2 hours and get cram a brunch in.  I'll talk to someone and 99% of the time when I look at them while they talk, i cannot bring myself to actually listen.  It's affected my relationship with my 1 year old daughter as I was hoping to be a lot more present with her and my wife, but my brain cannot be in the moment. It saddened me because despite being a very affectionate father, I knowfeel like I'm missing out.

Fast forward to a few days ago. I took the plunge and tried Vyvanse. Immediately. When I say immediately.

My anxiously wired brain with 50 open tabs per minute diminished to FOCUSING ON ONE THING AT A TIME. My tiny brain was unable to understand how that was even possible...  did not think about ANYTHING other then... What I was presently doing. And my brain would not let me get distracted. It was bonkers. I had my first deep conversation with my wife in who knows how long the other morning at breakfast My daughter was sitting in her high chair and I was so interested in her every gesture. I paid more attention to her at breakfast than the 5 months I had on parental leave with her.  It's crazy how ADHD can impact your life in a negative way. Another major improvement was simply my focus and alertness. I sat at work for 8 hours at the office today and was so determined to work. I was actually interested and would never get distracted by coworkers chatting around me.

Most importantly - I actually put off trying Vyvanse for 5 months because I was terrified of taking it and driving me right into a panic attack as I do not like any mind altering substances. Boy was I wrong. For the first time in my life - my extremely anxious brain has become focused, with absolutely zero feeling of anxiety. Why hasn't the SSRIS doctors pushed on me for long had the same effect? Funny how things are.

I did connect the dots. 
I was  the most hyper kid growing up. My siblings laugh about it when they recall some moments. I was the craziest. I'd be bouncing on the couch hours on end. 

So maybe being so hyper as a kid switched as I got older and now that I do not have all that energy to be so hyper, my wired brain stayed the same as when I was a little young.

******FOLLOW UP AFTER WRITING MY POST*********

I am FLOORED. I thought I'd maybe have about 5 people have the same vibe from their anxiety being diminished greatly when starting Vyvanse. Thanks everyone for such the kind words. It really makes me smile to see so many people feeling the way I do and enjoying being clearminded. I must add a few other points I've noticed improvement on :

-Less impulsive. I used to get ticked off at the smallest things.

-More self confidence. I no longer feel jealous of people who walk by me and have their head up real high as ive always felt like I lacked confidence.

-No more social anxiety. I used to be so nervous having to go into certain public places, gatherings. This is greatly subsided.

-I am GENUINELY interested in people. As in, I used to never pay much attention to what people had to say due to my ADHD and now I am so involved in 1 on 1 conversations. 

- Not sure if it's dopamine boosting, but I feel a little head rush of happiness much more than I ever had. I'm guinenly happier.

-I no longer get distracted at my desk job.

-I show more affection to my wife and daughter.

- I used to worry about the stresses of future bills and overthinking... Now, I don't even give a shit. When the bill is due, I will have already set it in my calendar to pay it on time.

-My brain no longer gets anxiety. As in, I used to work myself up with some health anxiety... ""Is the food I just ate gone bad?"" ""Will I be I'll?"" ""My chest hurts. I hope my oxygen is okay""... ""Is my wife gonna make it home safe or will there be a car accident""? ""I'm terrified of the day my parents pass away"". ""I'm worried of having a stroke"". ""Do I have fatty liver""? ""I'm out of breath so easily"".... 

When I say shit like that LIVED in my brain all day, plus not being in the moment and focusing on life, I truly mean it.

It makes a week and I have absolutely not given a F**k about any of those things. Because I'm rationalising now. My anxiety is 0.

"A the day I dreaded that would come, that with my chaos morning brain i would take a dubble dose of vyvanse. I have 100 mg in my system, try to throw up to get it out, and curse my non existence gag reflex. I feel so stupid, I had a little change to my morning routine because one of my cats knocked over a plant in there food fueled frenzied. I always take one the moment I wake up, then eat breakfast get dressed and leave for work, when I enterd my bed room to grab a fews things for work, I saw my bottle vyvanse on my nightstand and thought ""oh yeah I need to take it before I leave"" only to realise a second later I already took it a half hour ago.

Called my doctor he just told me as long as I don't get heartpalpitations, I just have to ride it out, keep calm and avoid caffeine and stuff.
I at work now and I am an hour in with the dubble dose, and I regret comming into work so much.

I am nauseous, have a headache that feels like an elastic band around my head, tightness in my chest, but I am used to having panic attacks so I can keep that under controle. Thought maybe I might be super focused or something, but no I am  in a totally different level of wired and tired and feeling all jittery and my sound sensitivity only skyrocketed. But so far I am managing.

So what are you guys way of dealing with accidentally taking a dubble dose?

"I recently started taking Vyvanse 60mg, which has been overall incredibly effective and super helpful at work. My output at work has almost doubled, I'm able to focus for hours at a time, and I feel I'm more eloquent and analytical.

However, when I get to bed a good 13-14 hours after I've taken the medication, my mind is still very active. I find myself almost compulsively thinking about work, or whatever has interested me, and no amount of melatonin / magnesium / relaxation allows me to stop my mind going like an engine.

Does anyone else have this?",1,

"Edit to add: I'm in the US, New York State.

Thank the stars I have Medicaid. I get sixty 30mg capsules per month (two doses daily), and when I Iooked at my script on the Walgreens app and saw the cost without insurance I was literally laughing spontaneously with disbelief. You know. That laugh we get when something is so incredulous that laughter is somehow the thing that happens.

It was almost ONE. *THOUSAND*. DOLLARS.

I've known about the shortage for a very long time, and that it's pretty bad, but I never knew *how much worse* it was than I thought. Without insurance, I would have to walk away from the pharmacy counter empty handed. That number doesn't even include the cost of my scripts for Lamictal and propranolol. (I haven't even looked at those.)

The cost of the Vyvanse alone is how much I have to pay for *rent*. I cannot imagine still being stuck in that not-so-sweet spot where I make too much for Medicaid but not nearly enough to buy insurance. There are countless people in that very spot who need prescriptions that *literally keep them from DYING*.

How is anyone supposed to survive, let alone *live a life worth living*?

I am consistently shook.

Edit: I'm seeing comments with prices well under $200usd. Is this a New York State thing? (Oh yeah, I probably should have mentioned I live in NYS.)",1,
"I have been on Vyvanse for around 3 weeks, started on 30mg and taken down to 20mg because of tachycardia. I went for a follow up today and again, resting heart rate was 130ish. I think it might’ve been so high because i ran to the office, or maybe because i have previous medical trauma… I have used my partners smart watch to track my resting heart rate and it sat around 80-103 resting which isn’t horrible but isn’t great. My doctor advised me to take a 2 week break and get my thyroids checked and an ekg done. 

Obviously my physical health comes first, but man it’s midterm season and I can’t keep asking for extensions. I’m honestly feeling really upset, i cannot put into words how vyvanse has changed my life and how good it felt to just be able to do stuff. The quiet, the lack of racing thoughts, the lack of grogginess and feelings of depression after 22 years of struggling… I’m so mad? almost? like to have this life changing drug just taken away? 

I get that there’s other forms of treatments, and it could be an easy fix, but im honestly in despair right now. My doctor also mentioned that she could’ve possibly misdiagnosed me, which feels like another whirlwind of problems i’m going to have to tackle. I’ve tried every ssri/snri there is and never had any positive results. I don’t want to go through that again, I advocated for years to get myself diagnosed. 

side note: i will be getting a fitbit to monitor my heart rate once i get paid lol

Edit: yes i know the heart rate thing is concerning, i agreed with my doctor when she said it(yes a doctor not a psych see comments for more info)… this is more a vent about having to take a break from the meds after i saw lots of improvement. The doctor has a plan set in place of next steps, i’m just heart broken rn ",1,tachycardia
"I’m typically good with my daily meal planning, but I’ve been so stressed out at work lately that I’ve been living off of quick snacks. I’d say the snacks that I’ve been eating are healthy or healthy adjacent, but obviously it hasn’t been enough to properly fuel this mound of human flesh. 

For the past few days I’ve been crazy nauseated and a little lightheaded, but I had no hunger or hunger pains so naturally I thought I had food poisoning. 

Nope.

Just… gotta eat bud. 

I realized it this morning when I told my wife “I still feel like ass, but I feel like my body is telling me to eat a big greasy meal.”

I ate a big ass burger and now I feel a million times better. 

Don’t forget to eat

Edit: I’ve been on Vyvanse for about 2 years now so the appetite suppression isn’t as intense as it used to be. I think this incident happened because I moved to nights at work, I have a puppy who is draining my soul, and work has been extra stressful lately. All that plus the remaining appetite suppression from Vyvanse is enough for me to forget food exists i guess",1,
"i was recently prescribed vyvanse 50 mg after adderall wasnt lasting long enough and made me jittery. very excited to try as ive heard good things, except.....

problem 1) my insurance only covers generics, my pharmacy has been out of stock of the generic for 3 months and has no clue when they're going to get it in, they do have the brand name though

problem 2) the brand name without insurance is over $900 (totally insane) which i would *really* like to avoid

problem 3) that pharmacy is the ONLY one my insurance covers, ive had to leave around 3 pharmacies because of my insurance, this is the last one left.

i'm unsure if i can ask my psychiatrist to write my prescription as brand name only because my psychiatrist is *also* not covered by my insurance and i pay out of pocket to see him. are there any coupons i can use to lower the price? can i still ask my psychiatrist to write it as brand name? or should i just cave and shell out the 900? my life has gotten *so* much better after starting medication and i can't afford going back to how i used to be now (exam season) so im a bit scared

it's genuinely crazy how medication we need to have normal lives costs so much, any advice is appreciated :(

edit: the craziest thing just happened, i called my pharmacy around noon asking if i could sign a form to request the brand name from my insurance. they told me yes and to come in that day. immediately after though i got a message from my pharmacy that my prescription is ready to be picked up... i went over, and was able to pick up the full 30 days for *free* (brand name!!!). no clue what happened but i have my meds so ?? success ??",1,
"I was diagnosed recently and tried Ritalin, then my doctor put me on Vyvanse. Both medications had pretty much the same effect (lessened my symptoms, didn't feel any side effects except increased heart rate and I don't 'crash') and I'm extremely happy Vyvanse works, but it just doesn't last long enough. Im currently in highschool and while it does make my school days tolerable, it slowly fades in about the last 2 hours then the effect dissapears. This is not good for me because I have to study after school, and I have other responsibilities. After telling them the problem, I asked my parents to schedule another appointment with the doctor, and they said that they had accommodated me enough and that I need to just push through it. I said that the doctor might be able to change the medication or provide me with an instant release medication in the afternoon so I can study and do well at school. They told me that I was becoming a drug addict and that everyone struggles and that I need to learn to live in the circumstances I'm currently in. So, what can I do to make the Vyvanse last longer and is there any issues with using an instant release stimulant in the afternoon after the Vyvanse's effect dissapears?",1,increased heart rate

Is this a common side effect?",1,

"Pretty much exactly as the title suggests I started taking Vyvanse a little while ago. I have battled ADHD all my adult life and it worsened most recently as I was going through a break up. I wasn't able to do normal things like make my bed or feed myself (I know these are also signs of depression, but they are heightened by my ADHD). I received a stern talking to at work about my lack of performance and it struck me just how bad it had gotten. I was getting up to sit in front of my laptop and just stare at it for hours while my brain searched for the things I needed to prioritise and then went into hours long analysis paralysis. I was very open with my clients about my mental health, because honestly at that point i had nothing to lose, and they were very understanding (which I realise is literally a god send) and I decided to talk to my psychiatrist about it. I had tried Ritalin many times before but it made me tweaky AF and want to chain smoke cigarettes (I don't even smoke and never have) so I was apprehensive of Vyvanse. It just became available in my country and I want to cry with joy. It is not even 9am here and I have made my bed, made coffee and ticked 3 things off my work to do list and I just want to share my joy. I hope everyone finds an ally like this!

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I started taking Vyvanse of negative experiences with Ritalin and I can function like a normal human being",1,
"I had my second visit with a new psychiatrist, and it went terribly. This provider, supposedly specializing in ADHD, called me a drug addict for advocating for myself.

Stimulants were life-changing after 21 years of struggling. On Vyvanse, I became functional, confident, and better at relationships. I maintained the same dosage for over 2 years without tolerance issues.

During the shortage, I went without for 6 weeks. Life became hell again. When I finally got pills, they were ineffective, even with increased dosages.

I switched to Focalin, which worked even better than Vyvanse. I took it daily for 6 months without issues. Then, due to insurance changes, I had to see a new provider.

This new provider insisted I ""strictly cannot"" take stimulants daily, despite my explanation of their benefits. She prescribed only 15 pills for over 30 days.

Those 30 days were miserable. The Focalin lost effectiveness, and my productivity, self-esteem, and confidence plummeted.

I brought this up in our second session, hoping she'd reconsider. Instead, she called me a ""drug addict because I am asking for more pills."" When I mentioned my history of daily use without tolerance issues, she replied, ""I can only treat based on professional data."" She ended by saying, ""I won't be prescribing controls of any type until I receive proof that you completed a substance abuse program.""

I'm not a drug addict! I have ADHD and need these meds to function. Why are doctors focused on treating the average person instead of the individual? Just because 85% of people build tolerance to stimulants doesn't mean the 15% who don't should be treated the same way.

Needless to say, I'll be finding a new doctor.",1,
"Has this happened to anyone else? I feel like I am losing it.

&#x200B;

I tried to switch a LOWER dose of Vyvanse recently (from 30mg 2x a day to 20mg 2x a day) and my insurance refuses to cover it. Got a prior authorization, got a letter of medical necessity from my doctor; they said screw my doctor's note and just WILL NOT cover it. They say why can't i just take 40mg once a day (40mg gives me severe anxiety and vyvanse only lasts 6 hours for me so I need 2 per day). They covered 30mg twice a day with no issues except for a single, easy prior auth for a FULL YEAR prior to this. 

&#x200B;

I feel like my only option left is to endlessly harass them on the phone until I reach someone that will help me. 

&#x200B;

I don't understand why the insurance decision is higher than my doctor's note which explains clearly why I need the specific dosage? Does anyone here have experience with something like this, or if this is even legal? I feel like this cannot even be legal.",1,
"After 10 years, I finally managed to quit Vyvanse and the benefits have been tremendous. More emotionally available for my wife and kid, creativity is through the roof. Still spacey, all-over the place some days but all of the Vyvanse negatives are gone… Took multiple tries to fully quit over the years, and now I have zero interest in taking it ever again.

However. My appetite feels permanently ruined. Even 1 year later. I’ve lost the ability to enjoy food, as it no longer really appeals to me. I have to remind myself to eat nearly every day (having a kid helps with this) but on my work days I’ll realize I need food because of my energy level dropping a ton in the evening, but I swear I used to FEEL hungry before I was prescribed Vyvanse. Even my favorite foods just aren’t enjoyable. Ice cream, fast food, nothing. It’s like i’m now detached emotionally from food. This might seem like a great thing but I’ve always struggled to gain or put on any weight, and I was really hoping being off the medication would help me regain it back.

Has anyone else experienced this?",1,
"Besides the shortage of generic vyvanse going on, has the prices of Vyvanse generic gone down at all? I remember when people posted how it was still so expensive.

"Hey all! I'd love some insight/advice ... 

My primary care doctor connected me with a psychiatrist in my network who I met for the first time last week. I've been taking Adderall for about a year and a half (female, 35, USA) and it's been a game changer. For the first time in my life, I can actually focus and concentrate. 

I've read a lot about Vyvanse, and how some people really like it while others prefer adderall, and I told the psychiatrist I'd like to give it a try and see if I get a better result than Adderall. 

She essentially said no, and told me getting insurance to cover it would be difficult and that it wouldn't be worth the effort as I'd probably not notice much of a difference. I wanted to push for it, but she seemed firm on not writing a script.

Since this is the rest of my life I'm talking about, I appreciate any feedback y'all have.

I'm also curious if anyone has tried or been prescribed modafinil for mental alertness? 

::EDIT:: 
Wow, thank you for all the feedback! This has been very helpful. I’d like to mention that I’m curious if Vyvanse has a slower tolerance built up, as with both the immediate and extended release Adderall I have to take a two or three day break for it to truly reset in my system every 2 - 2 1/2 weeks.",1,
"I had taken Concerta before, but I could never sleep more than 2-3 hours when I took it. Eventually another doctor suggested I try Vyvanse 30 mg and I've been on it for a couple of days.

&#x200B;

It has been doing wonders for everything from my mood and emotional regulation to my ability to start a task and go through with it and I feel it has even helped my anxiety a bit.

&#x200B;

However, I've noticed that just after I take it, I tend to be more irritable for about 40 mins to 1 hour. I'm not sure that it's an effect of the medication or just my usual morning irritability right after I wake up yet, but it feels stronger on some days since I started Vyvanse.

Would it be normal/common if it's caused by the meds? Would there be any way to reduce that in any way? I think I remember having seen a post about it months ago on here, someone saying that eating protein at breakfast helped iirc? Does that work? (could be misremembering)

&#x200B;

Another thing that's very noticeable is that my social battery seems to not run out? Before when having a conversation with someone I'd have to stop after a while because I'd start feeling exhausted and then get in a bad mood if it continued beyond that, but ever since I started taking Vyvanse, that hasn't happened. I can talk for hours and hours, talk all day and always want to talk. I sit down to read a book and one page in I'll see something I want to share with someone and get up to share it and then I might talk for hours to that person (jumping topics of course).

Does this happen a lot on Vyvanse? My mother said that it makes it feel like I'm a completely different person to her and I agree (not in a negative way).

&#x200B;

Anyone had a similar experience? How did you manage the irritability and/or social-ness?",1,"irritable, irritability, i"
"I am literally furious because if I never end up reading one of the comments a user left in another website I would never going to find out that I was taking a generic version.

Worse part is my doctor never told me this, and for the last month I have been completely wasting my time.

"Generics are “out” and so now my insurance only covers generics, not brand name. My pharmacy hasn’t received a shipment of the generics, though. I paid out of pocket for brand name and will call the insurance to get a reimbursement, so the net cost will be the same. I’m just $200 poorer for a week or two. This weird issue will be fixed in a few weeks when the system adjusts, but in the mean time I wanted to warn people in case they run into the same issue and their cash flow is very tight.

My insurance: United Health
My pharmacy: CVS
What I normally pay: $30
What I paid today: $211.54

TLDR: if your cash flow is very tight and you are on vyvanse, try and time it so that you either have $250 in your bank account when you pick up your prescription or $250 left in credit available. If this happens to you, getting a reimbursement IS POSSIBLE so your NET COST will be the same, but you may need to pay extra up front.",1,
"I've had a very interesting two weeks with my vyvanse and experienced a lot of things I never expected my medication to do. I was previously on this medication for 3 years and found a lot of success in it but had to briefly stop taking it for 4 months due to a lapse in insurance. 

This isn't to scare anyone but maybe give some insight to anyone who may be going through this in the future and wondering if it's too much. 

Two weeks ago, I was re prescribed my previous dose of 50mg after 4 months of not taking it and having lost a decent amount of weight since. 

After a few hours, I was shaking, sweating, and had the worst anxiety of my life that just wouldn't end. I felt really really high, my eyes were heavy, and was struggling to stand without swaying. My heart rate was astronomical. 

It felt like everyone was moving too slow.

After titrating the dose with water down to 40, I felt very spaced out and like I was moving a few ticks slower than everyone else.

I was reperscribed 30mg this week and did not find success there either, but felt somewhat closer to the desired effect I once had with it. 

I've had insomnia for multiple days, been struggling to eat properly, and have been somewhat out of it all week. I've been hyperfocused on the wrong things, stuttering and stumbling over my words, and very easily confused. My house and job are spotless, but at what cost.

What was truly my breaking point was the twitching I started to experience. If I stand still for even a little bit, my head starts to twitch every few seconds. Still twitching right now. Absolutely wild. 

I was also struggling to stand without swaying and felt like my personality was at 100 all week. I lost my inside voice a bit and the filter between thoughts and words got a little blurry. I did a lot of thinking aloud loudly. 

It's been an absolute shit show. 

How did you know your dose was too high?

this med makes me uncreative and horribly existential, unlike the amazing Adderall (esp IR). Can’t have Adderall rn bc as you all know, war on drugs, thanks America, yeah party feeling pretty damn betrayed at the moment between this and the abdication of duty wrt COVID. 

AND YOU WANT ME TO PAY FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS FOR IT???

"Quick backstory - I've been diagnosed with ADHD for most of my life (26 F, got diagnosed as a teen) and a few months ago I was prescribed adderall for the first time. Been using it on and off (maybe once or twice a week, or even less) just because I'm a little scared of the potential health effects of using it every day. Also got prescribed Vyvanse, which I like too.

What really bothers me though, is that on adderall/Vyvanse I turn into a completely different person. Normally I'm sluggish, have persistent brain fog, am extremely pessimistic, low self esteem, and I'm generally an anxiety riddled, miserable human being.

On Adderall, suddenly I feel like I can take on the world. I'm confident. I want to DO things. The fatigue that plagues me is nonexistent. The anxiety recedes completely. I'm not scared anymore.

It makes me so sad that I can't be like this all the time. A normal, functioning person. That when the Adderall wears off, what's waiting for me... is myself.

Should I just say screw it and start taking Adderall every day? Is this just classic Adderall euphoria that I'm feeling that will fade away?

And does anyone on this sub feel like this....that Adderall creates this wonderful illusion of everything they ever wanted to be - happy, confident, focused, productive?

"As title says! I took my Vyvanse this morning but I completely forgot that I did, and drank a good amount of coffee. 

I’m suffering right now, feel super nauseous to the point where I want to throw up and can’t stop shaking.  Tried to eat some crackers but the second I bit into one I had to fight back the urge to puke.  Anyway to get rid of this or do I just have to suffer until it leaves my system? 

Edit; before I could even post this I puked my guts out lmao. Feeling much better now so I found my answer

Edit edit(?): Wow! First off thank you all for the advice and personal tidbits.  Reading them really helped me get a grasp on what the hell happened, and how I can avoid doing it ever again.  

Now that the moment has passed and I can take a step back and actually think, it seems like it was a couple different factors and not what I originally thought. I had already drank all of that coffee on an empty stomach so I literally only had Vyvanse and coffee in my system.  I thought it was the caffeine itself that was causing all that shaking and nausea, but I definitely get those same jitters when I don’t eat all day/at all. 

As for the nausea, I don’t know why it completely flew over my head but I took a food sensitivity test a while ago, and coffee was one of my top contenders for things I’m sensitive too.  I’m very small, 5’2 and 125 pounds.  So larger doses of things affect me harder because where else is it supposed to go in my stupidly pint sized body? I used to be a coffee queen in highschool, but now that I have my medications to curb that caffeine fix I was always looking for, I never need more than maybe a medium iced coffee to just satiate my want for a little drinky drink. Just a little treat. I also don’t have an iron stomach like I did back then.  I can’t eat meat cause it hurts my stomach, too much bread makes me feel nauseous, and if it’s greasy/oily? Forget it. I’m knocked on my ass.  Heartburn and just puking straight oil. Not fun.   



Sooo TLDR; 
What caused this? 
Empty stomach, sudden large liquid intake of something im already sensitive to. And maybe coffee somehow acted like a double dose and made my 65mg skyrocket to like. 100mg.  I’ve seen a lot of reports that for some people caffeine acts like a strengthener for Vyvanse? Don’t be stupid like me guys",1,"nause, heart, vyvanse"
"can a pharmacist force you to return vyvanse before they will dispense an updated new dose? when i called my pharmacy to request to fill a new dose of vyvanse, my pharmacist said i needed to return x number of pills to her before she would fill my script. i offered to just wait until my lower dose was out to fill the next because of money reasons but the pharmacist said something along the lines of “we have to make sure your adhering to your prescription plan and you are supposed to be at a higher dose.” ive never had to do this before.

when i looked online, my cvs isnt one that has a drug take back program. she took them from me, counted them, and put them behind the pill counting counter. i didnt mind other than loosing hundreds of dollars of Vyvanse but im worried something sketchy could be going on or that im in trouble for something im unaware of. my psychiatrist said this is something she has never heard of.",1,
"About a month ago I had a weird conversation with the head of the team at the  company I worked for.  I had been struggling keeping track of 30 projects and keeping up with the support queue.  It was a serious conversation but at no time did I consider it a verbal warning but I felt that it was coming next.   I jumped into action, reached out and got reevaluated for ADHD and started Vyvanse. In that meeting I asked for weekly 1x1s with this person. Which he did I showed him my Google tasks lists and was prepared for every meeting. I felt I was making some okay progress.  I felt I had to do more.  I decided to stop playing video games in the evenings as well as stop mj.  It took a few days but coming down was affecting my sleep but it got better.  The changes were coming.  It was all very intense.  

The ADHD evaluation for meds took about two weeks to get an appointment and another to get an EKG scheduled and the prescription filled.  So dealing with healthcare and insurance and they still didn't have a prior authorization.  I tried as quickly I could with out abandoning my responsibilities as a parent, worker and human.  It took a day to get the prescription filled and I've been taking it for the last two days.

The first day on Vyvanse was amazing.  A project I was supposed to allow someone else do but they wasted a month and half.  I was able to sort it out in a day and a half.   

Even though I made a lot of mistakes not dealing with my ADHD and bad habits.  It felt really shit because I didn't talk to him about it.  He went, "" oh I didn't know.""  Right then I realized I fucked up not talking about it.  In the past I've been upfront in these meetings but I didn't this time because I made the mistake of thinking that I was over ADHD.  I am not.  I need medicine, therapy and some special provisions.  It sucked losing my job and a potential condo that I had also spent the last month trying to acquire.   I've made a lot of mistakes.

I reached out to a few friends.  They advocated for me to take a minute and then I spent today working on my resume, reaching out to people in my network on LinkedIn in .  I've already updated and arranged a meeting with some people on Monday.  

They offered me a lump payment but if I want to get the condo my best bet might be regular payments and they accommodated me.  

TL/DR. Continue to take your ADHD seriously.  I went off medicine for about 2 years and sometimes it was ok but I definitely deteriorated in a number of areas.  Be humble and accept your disability.  Get help.  Get support.  Don't suffer in silence.",1,
"Hi all. I got diagnosed with ADHD about a month ago and finally got my meds for it about a week ago. Since then, I have started writing again - something that I've always loved but always had a hard time focusing on unless I was hyperfixated on it. I've started cleaning. I can pay attention in college and I'm actually doing my assignments (if you know me, you'd know this is *huge*). I can pay attention to people when they speak to me. I can respond back without going all over the place. I can *function*.

I had no idea until now how intrinsically linked my ADHD was with my depression. I mean, I'm *functional* now. And because of that, I feel accomplished, and I'm doing my hobbies, and I'm feeling more confident about myself, and just... I'm smiling again. I'm finally smiling again.

My wife and family have even made remarks that I seem much more alive now. And not in a ""wired"" way. I'm just happier. This medication has done what all the antidepressants in the world couldn't do: it is giving me my life back.

* Want to request a refill? Sorry, you can't request that in our pharmacy app because **METH!** so you'll have to call the pharmacist and request it over the phone. Every. Single. Month. Yes, I know the prescription shows up in the app and lets you request a refill, but we'll deny that refill request untill you call us. (By the way, because we don't pay our pharmacists enough, they've all quit, so plan to spend at least an hour waiting on hold.) 
* Your local pharmacy is having trouble staffing up enough to fill your prescription? Sorry, you can't move that prescription to another location because **METH!** so you'll have to call your doctor to have them re-issue the prescription to another location for you. Hope *that* location works!
* Want to reduce the number of times you have to call and request your meds? Oh, sorry, you can't have more than 30 days of medication at a time because—you guessed it!—**METH!** so no 90-day prescriptions for you. Hope you remember to call us before you've run out!
* By the way, hope you don't need your medication in a hurry, because we've decided to limit the amount of any ADHD meds we import this year because—sing it with me now!—**METH!** I'm sure the limits on this will be sufficient to meet the needs of—what? Not enough? Oh well, that's too bad. Best of luck with that!
* Did you finally find a process that works for getting your meds consistently refilled from a pharmacy nearby? Hope nothing at all changes in your appointment schedules, prescription submissions from your physician, pharmacy staffing and supply levels, or the phases of the moon, because all of this will then reset and you'll be back to trying to figure out how to do this again!

The entire process appears to have been designed by a bunch of people who *don't* have ADHD to be as deliberately abusive, obstructive, and difficult *for people with ADHD in particular*. Presumably because **METH!** I'm just So. Freaking. Tired. of the whole dance every month.

**EDIT:** Wow, over 3,000 upvotes in 24 hours—I think I touched a nerve! To address a couple common themes in the comments:

* I actually don’t have much of an issue getting my prescriptions (or my kids’) from the doctor — thankfully, the docs we have are good about issuing them and will re-issue to the pharmacy if required to change locations. (I do have to remember to make the followups sometimes, but that’s another issue.)
* At least around here, none of the doctor’s offices will dispense medication directly: I have to get the scrip from the doctor and then take it to the pharmacy to actually get the medication. That’s where the majority of the problem is for me: the pharmacy is an awful morass due to dispensation controls, supply chain limits, corporate stupidity, additional corporate and personal gatekeeping/judgment, and political maneuvering that it’s a HUGE problem to actually GET the medication that I’ve been prescribed. And reading through the comments, my experience isn’t even the worst of the lot, so I’m feeling grateful for that, at least!
* There is, unquestionably, a problem of abuse with at least some ADHD meds. However, I think a great many like Vyvanse get lumped in with the heavily-abused ones, and there is a great deal of discussion to be had over whether the restrictions we have are actually doing anything useful right now or just making honest people suffer needlessly. Unfortunately, a lot of that discourse isn’t happening, which is frustrating!",1,
"I have been on Wellbutrin for my depression and anxiety for a while now but recently have been on Vyvanse. The Vyvanse helps with my energy and anxiety a ton but my focus still wavers so they put me on a higher dose of Vyvanse and had me take Adderall 5 hours later.

I thought I was dying. Insane heart rate, my chest hurt, my body was tingling and radiating, I couldn't stop shaking, I felt like I couldn't breathe anymore, my anxiety and panic set in. I thought I was having a heart attack. I found out that prescribing Adderall and Wellbutrin together can cause Serotonin Syndrome and Tachycardia and I'm pretty positive that's what happened to me. I was so sure I was dying that I wanted to go to the hospital but my husband kept assuring me that it was just the medications causing Serotonin syndrome and that going to the hospital would just costs thousands of dollars for them to say the same. I mean he was right, I'm still here and didn't die but I sure thought I was going to.

Anyways,  today was my (telehealth) follow up appointment with the provider and I told her what happened and what I had read about the problems of prescribing the two together. She told me ""you can prescribe them together, its fine. It wasn't even the Adderall, it was probably the Vyvanse."" But the Vyvanse I had been on and I liked it on the lower dose. She kept disregarding anything I would try to say and kept trying to sweep past the experience I had without acknowledging it and just kept interupting me anytime I tried to say something about what happened or how it felt.

She then was asking why I rescheduled the follow up and I told her because of what happened I wanted to speak with her about it and she said ""Well I wanted you to speak with this Dr about it, why did you reschedule with me?"" and I told her that I didn't know they had scheduled me with a different provider initially, they never told me and since I'd only been prescribed adhd meds by her that I figured I should continue talking to her. She said ""Well they are the new mental health specialist, I wanted you to speak with them. I'll have them call you to schedule. Just stop taking anything until you see them. Hopefully they can see you soon. Do you need anything else from me?"" 

At this point, I just felt so disregarded that I was just done. I felt like she was angry at me and had an attitude towards me. I don't know what I fucking did but she pretty much was just like you're not my issue anymore here's another try with this Dr. Idk, I just feel so unheard and almost guilty? Like somehow I did something wrong?  I just feel absolutely terrible and my depression is effectively in full swing. I hate being me.",1,"insane heart rate, serotonin syndrome, tachycardia, ##rotoni"
"I requested a call back from my psych over a week ago to discuss this, but so far I've heard nothing.

I think Vyvanse is making me depressed. I upped my dose to 50mg, and I notice that I feel really hollow and boring on the days I take it. Well, sometimes I do. Sometimes it's great and I am at a perfect brain level - sociable, effervescent, focused. Sometimes it's too strong and I am irritable and anxious. Most of the time, though, I'm just so fucking *boring*. It's like it's robbed me of my personality. I'm not funny anymore, I'm zoned out all the time, I don't pay attention to conversations, I trip up my words because I'm kind of fighting brain fog just to form them. Not to mention the fatigue that sets in after an hour or two.

Ugghhh. What is happening?? Why has it done this!!!",1,
"I'm on day ten of Vyvanse 20 mg. Me and my psych decided to start from this dosage because I have anxiety that he thinks may stem from untreated ADHD. As agreed with him, I will stay on this dosage for at least two weeks before trying the 30mg.

So far, Vyvanse has considerably decreased my anxiety, insomnia and emotional eating, but it is not helping with motivation and focus. 

I like feeling calmer and eating less, but I also feel way too slow, unmotivated and unfocused (like in my worst bad brain days). 

I am aware that the only way to know if Vyvanse works is to complete the titration and see how it goes.  
However, I am curious to know if any of you had similar issues when starting? If yes, did things improve with a different dosage or did you have to change meds?",1,"anxiety, anxiety, insomnia, emotional eating, ##motivated, ##focused"
"I started taking vyvanse 2 or 3 months ago. I started 10mg and have moved up to 40mg about 5 days ago.

I've started to notice some benefits but one thing that's happened is I've started ""tongue thrusting"". It has a name I've learned.

I've been pushing and sliding the my tongue into the back of my teeth. Especially when I sleep I think. So much so I've even noticed a slight shift on one of my top front teeth, which kind of freaks me out.

Did this happen to others? Have you been able to stop, and did anything help? 

I bought a drugstore mouth guard to hopefully prevent any other changes, but I don't want to fuck up my teeth. I have been drinking tea in the morning but I think I'll stop. Hopefully it will subside after I take it a bit longer.",1,
"When you take Vyvanse, do you ever feel a distinct ""switch"" an hour or so later? I’ve heard people mention feeling an immediate activation, like their mind suddenly quieting down or experiencing a sudden surge of motivation.

I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2022, and Vyvanse significantly helped my treatment-resistant depression. It's been a lifesaver on days when I've barely slept. But, I've never experienced this immediate 'light switch' moment with Vyvanse right after taking it.

What's it like for you?",1,
"I was on 40mg brand vyvanse for 2-3 weeks and it suddenly lasted for only 2-3 hours (including the time it takes to work).

My doctor prescribed me 50mg brand vyvanse and I tried it for the first time today. Same thing - I was still sleepy throughout the afternoon and napped 4 hours after.

I'm not sure what's happening and I'm losing all hope.

When the 40mg worked, it wasn't life-changing but it definitely kept me awake for 6 hours.

"i got up to go to the bathroom right before my first alarm and took my meds and went back to sleep and forgot i took them then took another 50 mg about 30-45 minutes later. i didn’t notice until i walked into my class building and i could not drown out the noise of the air conditioner, it was like a helicopter was landing on the building. and i felt like i was moving in slow motion. so realized what happened and called my doctor and left class right away and my doctor told me to keep my heart rate below 120 and if it goes above go to the ER. currently sitting in starbucks waiting for my girlfriend to get off work and take me home because i don’t think i can walk the four blocks without my heart rate going above 120. when i get home im gonna get orange juice and vitamin C because the internet says those help. has anyone done this before? any advice or reassurance that i’m not gonna have a heart attack would be greatly appreciated

update: jeez the vyvanse sweats are insane. i’m also cold at the same time. other than that tho my heart rate has been pretty regular, but im getting a headache and grinding my teeth

update 2: i am home safe my amazing girlfriend took me home. got a bit of a headache from grinding my teeth and im waiting for the orange juice and vitamin c to arrive, one weird symptom is im having like strong half sneezes. like i get the strongest urge to sneeze and then when i do barely anything comes out like its super weak its weird.",1,half sneezes
"I’m on day 4 of Vyvanse (30mg) and feeling discouraged. So far, I’ve had no benefits—just classy side effects like elevated heart rate and blood pressure, which make me anxious. It’s my third medication attempt, and I was really hoping this one would work. Super sad so far...

Has anyone else had a similar experience where they saw no benefits during the first week (or so) but later noticed great improvements (without upping the dose) once their body adjusted? I’d appreciate hearing some stories—really hoping for some encouragement...

However, one strange symptom is that i feel like I “capped” on how much I can put out myself. It sounds corny but I feel like that one time Spondgebob went “normal” for a episode.

"I was feeling sooo proud of myself today and am now  left feeling so down and defeated. 

I waited over a month to get in to see the doctor. Went and was prescribed Vyvanse, which is new to me, after not being in meds for around a year. I was so excited to be back on meds again and start getting my life back in gear. 

I went to the pharmacy and the pharmacist told me that, since I only have government coverage (I'm in British Columbia, Canada), for the generic brand it would cost me $110 and it'd be pretty much double that amount for the name brand.. This shocked me. I was previously on Dextromaphetamine and that was free to me and before that, I was on Concerta which was $35/mo...I feel so discouraged that I could cry. I just don't know what to do. I can't afford this at all.. Why in the world is Vyvanse so expensive? It's crazy! ",1,
"I was taking Vyvanse (30/40mg)and later Dexdrine (5mg) and ended up in psychosis for years without realizing that I was in psychosis. There was a time when a voice in my head told me to stand in front of a car. Moreover, I started thinking people on Instagram were talking to me. I thought people around me were talking about me. 
The scariest was when I fell on the floor screaming like a madman and my parents had to take me to a psychiatric hospital. I am terrifyied about going on ADHD meds again. For two months, I was thinking nothing but cutting my wrists or hanging, I don’t know why it happened but it has to be the most terrifying experience about my life.

For months all I was doing was trying to kill myself and also was about to commit major self harm, I was scared I was going to cut my genitals.

Anyone else has experienced anything similar?

"hi there!

this isn't my first time on meds, but it is my first time taking vyvanse. i was on ritalin for about a year starting at the end of 2021, and then i stopped once i graduated high school in nov 2022. tried to start again at the same dose once the first semester of uni started, but it was giving me agonising headaches daily so i stopped again pretty quickly.

now, a year and a half later, i've started vyvanse 20mg. i had my first dose almost three hours ago, and all it's done so far is make me anxious and restless. my psychiatrist prepared me for this so i'm not surprised, i'm just a bit disappointed i'm not seeing any of the productivity i was hoping for.

do the positive effects of vyvanse take longer to kick in than ritalin (i think it's also called concerta)? when i started ritalin i noticed i could Do Shit within half an hour of my first pill. if i just need to wait a day or two then i can deal with that, just wanted to seek answers because the info sheet that came in the box doesn't really answer my question haha

"Reading everyone talking about dosage times is kinda crazy to me. I try to take my first dose of Vyvanse (30mg) at 9am… although sometimes it ends up being as late as 11am. Then my booster (10mg) I try to take around 6pm. Sometimes as late as 730pm. Previously I was on 1 dose (20mg daily) and found that even on the days I took it super late (like 1 pm because I had to be focused for work during the evening), I had no problems sleeping. And now I 50/50 take my booster as late as 730pm and fall asleep no problems at 11pm. It’s like my historically insomniac l, night owl brain says ‘you’re supposed to turn off and go to sleep, so turn off and go to sleep!”  And so it does.

"Yes, it is a stimulant. For what it's worth, when I first took Adderall and Vyvanse I had similar side effects and then after like two weeks the side effects either became like a lottt weaker or completely disappeared. I rarely get headaches, never got blurred visions though, and it hardly affects my appetite anymore. I used to get really tired when it wore off but that doesn't happen anymore at all. I found that taking it on the weekends when I didn't work was still helpful like spending less money when I shopped, less mistakes when driving, and a better listener when my partner talked to me. The only reason I don't take it on the weekends now is bc after a little under two years I learned I quickly develop a tolerance and the highest dose did nothing. My work performance suffered a lot and then my mental health crumbled bc of it and I had to take a very long medical leave/drug vacation. That's not the case for everyone. Some ppl take it years and years and barely develop a tolerance if at all. If that were the case for me I'd definitely take it on the weekend bc ADHD affects every part of your life, not just school or work. I remember crying when I realized how much easier reading for fun was when I took ADHD. When I tried to do it without meds for the first time I felt so dumb and that's when I cried.

"Think of Vyvanse as the extract of adderall. Everything adderall is and does for you intensified a bit, but without the controlled substance aspects of it.

"I don't think so. Lisdexamfetamine (the generic drug in name brand Vyvanse is a somewhat slow release inherently because it's a ""prodrug"" and your body has to break off the lysine molecule attached to the lisdexamfetamine molecule to release the amphetamine molecule and that takes place over time. I believe the gel beads in name brand Vyvanse as described to me, never seen it with my own eyes are for additional slow release. Which I worry would be too slow? I need to take any lisdexamfetamine I take in a day first thing in the morning or getting to sleep can be quite problematic. And the effects are slow enough to kick in as it is, if not for a strong espresso first thing in the morning I'd be useless for hours waiting for the lisdexamfetamine to kick in enough.",1,
"I'm from Australia. Although we have universal Medicare coverage, our health system has gradually be inching in the same direction. I am yet to meet a single person in Australia who thinks this to be a good idea who was not either a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party (equivalent-ish to Republicans or UK Conservatives), exceedingly wealthy, or both. 

Universal coverage is popular, very popular. Private health insurance seems almost universally viewed as needed to deal with problems in the public system attributed to underfunding and political neglect.

I now live in Spain. The process of being diagnosed was surprisingly quick and was free. Although i previously paid for my ADHD meds, my now higher dosage is free. When I dislocated my shoulder I recieved frequent physiotherapy, various tests and medical appointments and it was all free and without excessive wait lists.

I now function better and have (almost) full rotation back in my (now) pain-free shoulder and none of it cost a cent. This is what my parents remember of the Australian system when they were younger. I'm loving Spain for this.

And now, it’s been about a year, my psychiatrist told me she thinks I should try Concerta again since I take better care of myself maybe the irritability will go away. Maybe i was grouchy on concerta bc i didnt drink enough water or eat healthy. So…..

I tested the concerta for a week, using my new improved *taking care of myself* knowledge 😂 and I didn’t have the irritability! (I had a bunch leftover from my old script).

Can anyone try to describe how Adderall (generic IR) and Vyvanse affected them differently? For example, I feel like Adderall is incredibly crucial for me to live my life, but it feels very up and down and the XR just gives me anxiety and doesn't do much. I tried Ritalin in my teens, and I ACCOMPLISHED EVERY SINGLE GOAL IN MY LIFE IN RECORD TIME, but that's ALL I COULD DO. I couldn't talk to friends. I didn't have emotions. I'd go home after school, play a game of MW2 Team Deathmatch, die one time, then turn the console off and stare at the wall for 4 hours, as it I had actually died, which is really weird, because why would i even choose Team Deathmatch in the first place.

I was brushing this off since the Vyvanse dose is higher but then I finally pulled up a dose calculator and saw that the conversion from just 30 mg of Adderall is 70 mg of Vyvanse. It would not allow me to convert 60 mg of adderall to Vyvanse saying it was higher than recommended dose. It then said the off label recommendation is 60 mg per 50 kg of weight.

A year an a half ago I left my university due to a manic episode. I was an impatient for a week. 

I was in a fraternity so I had been frequently binge drinking, along with taking Focalin for my ADHD, and smoking pot quite frequently.  I was also pretty high stressed and had mild depression. After a weekend of LSD and ecstasy I turned manic.

From then on, I became stable on risperdal 1mg, 300 lamictal, and .5 clonazapam.

I returned to school the following semester without any problems. I remained at school for the summer and against my school psychiatrist's recommendation I decided to come off of my meds. I followed his instructions on discontinuing the medication and before I was completely off of them I now realize that I was becoming fixated on ADHD. I would read books, online articles, and frequently I would explain my behavior in conjunction with what an ADHD person would do. It was extremely hard to read and do summer school homework because I blamed my ADHD. 

I started to self medicate by drinking about 5 cups of coffee a day and taking melatonin as well as Vitamin B6 and Magnesium. 

Nothing helped. 

With the added stress of finals I took three 50 mg Vyvanse over the course of three days to study for a final exam. I tried to sleep during this period of time but I'd say I went around 50 hours with little to no sleep. 

After finals came the beginning of Fall semester and my social anxiety was at an all time high. With my fraternity brothers moving back in I had difficulty maintaining conversations (mainly focus) with people and became withdrawn. I was afraid to go into the foyer because girls might be around and was basically walking on eggshells. This was strange because I am a fairly social person.


I then had very intense derealization where nothing on earth seemed real. I had to come home and I was even afraid of my parents because they didn't seem real. I had no emotional connection with them and it was like living with strangers than the parents that I truly love. At this point my school psychiatrist put me back on 150 lamictal, 1 mg risperdal, and .5 clonazapam

Anyways, My school psychiatrist recommended staying on my meds for at least 1 year after my derealization episode.

I tried to get through school with the derealization which lasted nearly 2 months but I had to leave school again.

I returned back to school in the spring and did well again. I came home this summer and did just fine. My home psychiatrist took my off of risperdal and at my next appointment before school starts he wants to begin discontinuing the lamictal. 

I am unsure as to stop taking the lamictal. I read that derealization can be caused by stopping the medication. Am I serving any purpose by staying on the medication? 

Basically I am confused because I don't have a definitive diagnosis. At the impatient facility I was categorized as Bipolar NOS but I have no family history of it. My doctor won't prescribe amphetamines to me although I have an ADHD diagnosis from when I was 10. I even asked for Strattera and he wouldn't give me that.

Right now I'm completely normal despite attention difficulties. One doctor thinks I should stay on meds, and the other not. They both have 30+ years experience so I don't know who to go along with.


TLDR: manic episode after LSD and ecstasy, got medicated half a year, came off meds and had derealization, went back on meds just fine for close to 9 months, now my other doctor has me coming off all meds while my school doctor wants me to remain on them.",1,man
"Methylphenidate is very much different though as all the different brand preparations use different amounts of immediate and modified release medication.

I'm somewhat worried if you work with people with ADHD and don't understand the difference between IR and XL formulations of ADHD medication though...",1,
"Yes you are correct. Especially with extended release formulations, which employ all sorts of different matrixes and methods to prolong drug release. Some also release drug at different sites in the GI tract, at different pHs, which affect absorption. I’m a lurking clinical pharmacist with ADHD, not currently on stimulants (pregnant), and a couple years ago I looked into this extensively (ie. wasted a few hours on my off day hyper focused on this instead laundry) after I started to notice a particular generic wasn’t feeling the same. I was just curious whether it was all in my head or not, though, so unfortunately I can’t recall any useful details.

Edit: my “sources” include the comprehensive ingredient lists for each generic/brand, which can be found via dailymed.nlm.nih.gov, and google searching every single ingredient that I didn’t recognize. Admittedly not the most valid of sources here, but it was all done for my own personal knowledge gain. If it’s not obvious, I really, REALLY don’t like doing laundry….",1,
"Activation requires cleavage of the lysine group from the dextroamphetamine. I wonder if they used a different mechanism to attach that lysine amino? Or maybe one of the excipients makes that process in the liver more difficult? 

No idea. But for this reason I was personally not a fan of vyvanse even when branded. There seemed to be a lot of variability from week to week. Sometimes it would take 5 hours to start working and left me up all night, other times the opposite. Curious if liver metabolism can fluctuate and cause that type of experience?",1,
"Just wondering what other’s experiences have been. 

I have been taking 20mg of Vyvanse for a while and have been happy with improvement in my executive functioning, decreased binge eating and better focus. 

However, my old anxiety has been creeping back. Borderline panic attacks for no obvious reason, rage, crying and repetitive thoughts of inadequacy. My psychiatrist prescribed 50mg Zoloft. 

I’ve only had 3 doses and have noticed good improvement with my anxiety. My mind is quiet. I do feel a little bit absentminded and find myself zoning out a bit. But somehow still getting things done. I’m just finding myself hyper focusing on how the Zoloft is making me feel and wonder if I might be a bit too space-y.

Just wondering if things will even out a bit or if the intensity will continue to build? Maybe I need to half my doses for now and see? Is this something I will start to get used to?",1,"border, panic attacks, rage, thoughts of inadequacy"
"I realize that this is an antidepressant subreddit, and I am talking about an ADHD medication here but I, and so many others, know what it's like to have untreated anxiety and depression because of potential ADHD.    This might be a bit long, but I'm hoping to connect with the right people who understand my struggle and maybe have some solutions for me

For the last 10 years, I've tried the whole carousel of SSRI/SNRI/tricyclic medications to manage my anxiety and depression and all of them were SHIT. Sure, they helped lower my negative emotions....but they also made me not care about ANYTHING. Essentially floating through life being a good little worker bee for the benefit of the hive.    But then not caring about myself, or other people, or about my job. Everything is just so ""blah"" and made my pre-existing anhedonia even worse.  I know that sooo many people benefit from them, but this has been my experience, and judging from anecdotes and even some studies found online, I' not the only one who's felt this way while taking SSRI's. 

Fast forward to this year when I saw a new psychiatrist who took a complete life history and asked me if I've ever been told I have ADHD, because he could see it clearly. So we started a stimulant, the idea of which made me nervous at first because I was worried it would spike my anxiety.  (caffeine does that to me).

I've been on 60 mg Vyvanse for 3 months now, and for a long time it was working beautifully - not just to treat my hyperactivity (which it did!), but a big part of what made it so successful for me was its ""antidepressant"" effect.

But now, it does NOTHING for me except maybe help my concentration for a few hours and then feel foggy. 

Now, when I say ""antidepressant"" effect,  I don't mean that it made me speedy/euphoric/on top of the world. It's very important that I emphasize this. 

Particularly, it calmed the savagely negative thought loops that have gone through my head my whole life, made me MUCH MORE patient around other people, and actually made me NOT want a huge asteroid to wipe out humanity every day. I felt a boost in energy which also made me motivated to ACT rather than procrastinate. Even though I've been a lifelong movie fan, I could NEVER sit still long enough without checking my watch and counting the minutes. To now suddenly be able to do something you enjoy without wanting it to be over, like NORMAL fucking people do, felt GOOD.   I  now understood what it meant when people talk about living in the moment and ""being present"". 

This also extended to social interactions with people - instead of drifting off when people are talking,  missing parts of conversation, and having that voice in my head telling me that the person in front of me is probably a jerk who shouldn't be trusted anyway,  NOW I could finally ""be present"" and be the person I've always wanted to  be.   Which is....a nice, caring, empathetic person who wants to help other people. 

 These are the things I'm referring to when I say the ""antidepressant"" effect. 

You see the testimonies from people on ADHD subreddits and beyond, talking about how starting ADHD medication was like ""putting on glasses for the first time"". 

But then at the same time, you don't hear very many LONG TERM success stories. From various research studies, doctors, and anecdotes from people on here, it seems that the vast majority of GOOD things that I just mentioned, are actually unintended side effects of the medication...and the true aim of the medication is to make you concentrate for a few hours before you have an ugly crash.

Am I correct with these assertions? In other words, the energy boost, the happy feelings, the motivation, the empathy towards other people......these are things that aren't meant to be felt long term? If so, that's DEVASTATING for me

Vyvanse provoked positive thinking for me like:  . The idea of going back to school, being interested in dating again, doing laundry and grocery shopping without it feeling insurmountable......these were all benefits I've had from Vyvanse, and now it's been stripped of me. I take the medication, feel some slight focus for a few hours and then crash badly .

I've taken 2-3 day breaks, with the hopes that it would work well again upon re-initiation , but I have never been able to get those feelings back.

I've also done the usual suggestions - taking the medicine with a protein rich meal (and also trying on an empty stomach), avoiding vitamin C/grapefruit, drinking TONS of water and sleeping at least 7 hours each night.

Am I being impractical with my expectations? Are there alternatives that I can bring up to my psychiatrist for the symptoms I'm wishing to get better relief from?

Would Wellbutrin be something to consider?

"I take Gabapentin 300mg for sleep and Vyvanse 40mg for TRD (not ADHD). 

I was doing fine with my depression (was stable on 40mg for 9 months) until we added the gabapentin. I was on it 100mg BID for anxiety (which did next to nothing) for 2 years but recently stopped sleeping, so it was changed to 300mg HS for sleep at my last psychiatry appointment 2 weeks ago. 

Since this change, I noticed I cannot focus, motivate myself, or even stay awake. I’m suddenly back to being depressed as well. Previously vyvanse wiped away all these symptoms. 

Does gabapentin offset the effects of Vyvanse or is my body still adjusting to getting used to the change of gabapentin?",1,

"I was on Zoloft for about a month to a month and a half to help with the anxiety issues caused by Vyvanse. The crash mostly. What ended up happening was that I going numb on it. The Vyvanse wasn’t working at all after a certain moment. My forgetfulness was off the charts. The Zoloft was a life saver at the beginning but maybe the dosages weren’t right. I think I was on too low of Vyvanse for it to not be completely overtaken by the Zoloft. I was only on 12mg of Zoloft. Very little because I have an overactive thyroid and I’m pretty medication sensitive.

Anyways, I stopped the Zoloft last Friday. So 6/9. Honestly for a week I had no reaction to getting off of it, but then a week later, I was just having rage attacks. Nothing outbursty but I was a snarky ass and snippy. I thought this was just stress at first. And now I’m feeling very depressed.

"Hey guys - just wondering if anyone has any experience with, or knowledge of SS. Unsure whether I need to go to the ER

Firstly - I have a history of anxiety - landed myself in the ER a few weeks ago thinking I was having a heart attack. ECG and blood tests were all normal and the ER doc said it was an anxiety attack.

- I was prescribed Lexapro 10mg
- today I upped my dose to 15mg (took before bed)
- I also took my vyvanse 60mg, as I’ve been doing for the last 12 months, BUT I might have accidentally taken it twice today
- I’ve also recently started taking two teaspoons of turmeric per day

These things have got me worried about potential serotonin syndrome, because:

- I developed a headache before going to bed. 
- I woke up 30 mins ago (it’s 4am here) and the headache is gone, but I had some bad discomfort below my rib cage on the left side - feels like a cramp or something.
- I was feeling palpitations and shortness of breath after waking up (this is consistent with my earlier-mentioned anxiety attack)
- I’m noticing while typing this that my vision isn’t great - the letters look slightly blurry and I’m struggling to focus on writing this, but I’m extremely sleep deprived (barely slept last night and tonight)
- there was a random twitch in my left eyebrow (it was intermittent for about ten mins, but seems to have stopped in the last 20 mins) (also, my eyes feel strained from reading/typing)
- I kept hearing a weird fizzing / buzzing sound that seemed to be coming from my right ear (never experienced this before) but that‘s stopped in the last 15 mins
- no abdominal pain or diarrhoea but I was hearing some gurgling sounds coming from my gut (that also stopped 10 mins ago)
- I took some Valium 25 mins ago (prescribed after I went to the ER with the anxiety attack) and feel much better - the chest cramp has stopped 
-but I still have still have a very slight headache and just feel a little “off”, but again, I’m extremely tired 
- pupils look normal (I think)

I’m seeing my psychiatrist today for my regular ADHD appointment anyway, and I REALLY don’t want to go back to the ER. I know SS can be fatal though, and I’d prefer not to die.

How concerned should I be?

"Hey y'all, long time no post. Have been doing sort of okay on the above two meds. We increased Trintellix to 20mg in late November and I think it finally kicked into overdrive because I am experiencing many of the same side effects as I did on SSRI/SNRIs. Mostly excessive daytime sleepiness: continuously falling asleep/nodding off at desk at work in the daytime, needing naps in the afternoon, nodding off behind wheel if driving at times (I do not commute to work and currently avoid driving long distances due to this for everyone's safety). I am hoping to pull the Trintellix back to 10mg this month as that dose did not give me this side effect. 

I am asking the doc about adding on Abilify. I have major behavioral issues/addictions: food, shopping, new hobbies that will only last a short time before I lose interest, etc. I also have extreme motivation issues from executive dysfunction. A lot of my behavioral issues seem to be related to dopamine rather than serotonin. This is pretty much confirmed by the fact that a previous SSRI at a very low dose gave me mild serotonin syndrome last year. I figure I am in need of something more dopaminergic to assist now. I am diagnosed autistic which also makes Abilify a good choice as it is studied and indicated on-label as a treatment for executive dysfunction and aggression in autistic people, both of which I experience heavily (and no medication so far has touched). I may be depressed, but that doesn't explain a lot of this stuff, and I may have some ADHD traits which the Vyvanse kind of helps, but the sheer lack of ability to start tasks that I can literally plan out in my head (which seems to give me more contentment than actually \*doing\* the task) is so freaking aggravating.

As always, more than open to suggestions, experiences, and warnings/concerns about Abilify. I'm well aware of the weight gain issues, but I have already gained 50lbs since I started SSRIs and my addiction to food hasn't gotten any better. I will likely die of obesity-related illness if nothing changes, so I have nothing left to lose in that regard.",1,serotonin syndrome
"Hello, my daughter has been diagnosed with major depression and ADHD. Her doc prescribed 225 mg of Wellbutrin and 50 mg of Vyvanse. We started Vyvanse at 20 mg but the dosage has been raised to the current 50.

Has anyone here been prescribed both of these meds and did they cancel each other out like some online searches have lead me to believe?

The DR. hasn't returned my call yet but the pharmacist says that both meds will work as they're supposed to and that Wellbutrin and Vyvanse are very commonly prescribed together.
He also said that if the Wellbutrin does in fact inhibit the Vyvanse from working the DR. might just raise her dosage of Vyvanse which worries me because can't Vyvanse be habit forming?.

"TL;DR: I'm starting grad school in the fall and need to be in top cognitive shape.

"Good morning,

I started taking escitalopram for 3 weeks now (first week 2.5 mg and next two weeks 5 mg). I immediately noticed positive effects. I no longer think about suicide every day like I used to and I have much fewer anxious thoughts. However, my libido dropped drastically. I masturbated only once in 3 weeks, although I did it almost every day. I know sex isn't everything in life, but it will be difficult to be in a relationship in the future with so little libido and so much difficulty having pleasure and orgasm. Do any of you have a low libido at first, but it came back after a few weeks? It would reassure me to know that the libido can return after a few weeks. I'm a 31 year old woman if that helps.

Also, i take vyvanse 40 mg for 4 years now, so I can’t switch to any other antidepressants because of interaction. And I know that some people take wellbutrin to boost libido, but my doctor said it wouldn’t really help me overall because I already have sleeping problem.

THANKS!!

Ps: sorry for my english, it’s not my main language :)",1,low libido
"fellas, i know the correct action will always be to talk to the doctor, and i have with mine: when i mentioned having problems with erections, she said citalopram was likely the issue, and that we could switch to something else when i reached 60 days of treatment 

for context: i have depression, anxiety and adhd. we're treating the depression and anxiety with citalopram, and the adhd with vyvanse. 

they're working really well! i'm feeling better mentally and can finally focus on stuff and organize my life! it's been almost a month of treatment - if not a whole month.

anyway, what I've noticed is: my libido has INCREASED. i think this is due to vyvanse. now i'm always thinking about sex and feel horny all the time. except i CAN'T get a full erection, and that's been really annoying!

I'm really upset that one of the sacrifices of being on antidepressants is having your sexual pleasure altered substantially, and i don't think that's something i can afford right now. 

i have to admit, when i read about people struggling with permanent sexual dysfunction due to ssris, i got scared. and even more scared now that my libido seems to be torn between contradictory paths. 

so now I've been thinking of getting off citalopram on my own, since the side effects have been so harsh. but the question is: should i go ahead and do it now, on my own, or should i wait the 60 days my doctor mentioned and get off it with her instructions? i know the answer seems obvious but please hear my plea, put yourself in my shoes: i already have many insecurities about my body, i'm scared of permanently adding one more to the list.

" I learnt very quickly that there is a startup cost to most antidepressants on the market. I was on Prozac for seven years (and it changed my life for the better), but I remember the first month was hell and I didn't know if I could keep taking it. I have tried Prozac (7yrs before it stopped working), Pristiq (on now), Wellbutrin (could not take), Adderall (5yrs), Vyvanse (10 yrs) etc.  However, in the long term Wellbutrin and Adderall exacerbated my anxiety because of their effect of norepinephrine and dopamine respectively.

However, everyone is different biochemically. Some people have only physiological side effects or none at all, but at times my start up anxiety/depression was ridiculously hard to handle. BUT SNRI, AND SSRI's GENERALLY cause people to have worse panic attacks, worse symptomology especially the first weeks of starting. But I occasionally have heard of some people that for some reason just immediately feel better without getting worse first. (60% of people on Pristiq experience activation according to my research)

At first when you begin SNRI's and SSRI's you can expect to have (worst case scenario like me) sexual dysfunction, sweating, insomnia, weird feelings, panic attacks, weird dissociative feelings and also I felt cognitively dampened on Pristiq for about 4 weeks. I could not remember things, I would sometimes feel extreme rage etc.  Then once I remained on a dose of a medication for about a month you adjust and feel better than you did before. I actually notice my old self popping out at times now. 

Now, I am a 8 weeks in total on Pristiq and about two weeks on 75mg.  Side effects are are resolving, the panic attacks are reducing, insomnia is getting better, the rage is better gone almost, etc. I am still really anxious first thing when I wake up and then sporadically when I forget to take my propranolol (slows heart rate and lowers bp), and my gabapentin (helps with initial side effects).

Keep in mind I just recently went up on 75mg and am having to go throughout the adjustment all over. I can't speak as to the long term effects of this dosage yet.  However it would not have been possible for me personally to onload these medications without gabapentin and propranolol helping with the initial anxiety.

"Hi, I have taking Vyvanse 40mg and Sertraline 50-100mg for around 1 year now.

The Vyvanse is excellent. The Sertaline was also amazing for my depression. However, I developed sexual side effects - low libido, extreme difficulty ejaculating. 

I tried reducing my dosage back down from 100mg to 50mg and while I saw some mild improvements in sexual side effects the therapeutic effect and I was getting depression again. 

When I saw my psychiatrist I raised this and he said it might be advisable to switch to a different anti-depressant class. I thought he had talked about Wellbutrin. 

So I did a lot of research and felt somewhat comfortable with switching. When I went to my GP to get prescription he was not aware of this being prescribed in Australia for depression. Upon checking with my psychiatrist via a quick call while in the GPs office it was Duloxetine.

So in a bit of a mad rush my Sertraline has been cancelled and I’ve now prescription for Duloxetine. Normally I like to research beforehand and feel a little uncomfortable, it doesn’t seem like a popular anti-depressant.

"I was diagnosed with ADHD about 5 months ago. I was on Vyvanse for my treatment resistant depression for almost 2 years before my diagnosis. The Vyvanse helped SOO much with mood regulation, and pretty much completely eliminated my anxiety and depression. But then it totally stopped working, to the point increases weren’t even making a difference so my doc took me off it. I trialed 10mg Focalin IR (dexmethylphenidate) for a few weeks and found I actually liked it more than Vyvanse. The biggest difference I noticed was my auditory processing was significantly quicker (I’m also dyslexic), and that slowing down was often a sign I had to take the second dose. I was making a lot less mistakes with verbal information.

My problem with the IR was the fact that I needed to take it twice as I work up to 13 hour shifts and it just wasn’t lasting enough. But then the second dosage was causing sleep issues. So my doc changed it to 15mg of the XR. It didn’t have as many of the benefits as the IR did. I actually felt I was losing my focus quicker and getting more distracted. My auditory processing also was never noticeably different, compared to the IR. It wasn’t lasting long enough either, so my doc increased the XR to 20mg and gave me 10mg IR as needed. With the 20mg XR, I find I really only take the IR 2-3 times a week. 

This combination has been much better. With the exception of my anxiety being uncontrollable. My mood is greatly suffering on this combination. I also feel my frustration tolerance is significantly lower, lower than me without meds. When I’m stressed, it often leads to panic attacks, something I’ve never had before. I’ve been on Wellbutrin for about 4 years now as it’s the only antidepressant I can tolerate. Many others have given me horrible side effects that only worsened the longer I was on the medication. I also take Lamictal and guanfacine, but I’m not sure either does much. 

I really don’t want to come off this combination of stimulants, as I feel a big improvement in my ADHD symptoms. A bigger improvement than Vyvanse gave me. But I really can’t handle the severe anxiety I am experiencing. And my lowered frustration tolerance is just adding to the anxiety. I’m so afraid I’m gonna have a meltdown or nervous breakdown at work.

Anyone have any tips or suggestions on what to do to lessen the anxiety? The anxiety is driving my depression, so it’s just bad all around.",1,"ad, sleep, meltdown, nervous breakdown"
"Technically before this second attempt at trying Wellbutrin I had a half dose once about 2 months ago. 75mg cut in half. And recovered within a week. This time I immediately had symptoms again like before and while they faded after 3 or 4 days like last time, it seems they have started coming back? It's weird because these are a very specific set of symptoms like nausea and disconcertion/anxiety over flippant thoughts. 

Example: haha cute dog what if it was really huge! (Anxiety spike that unsettles my stomach and nauseates me, instead of having my usual chuckle at my funny thought) 

Is this normal? I know my dose is laughably small but I am known to be extremely sensitive to medication and it similarly took me MONTHS to recover from two doses (2!) of Zoloft when new doctor thought I was depressed (I have adhd/autism and am using Wellbutrin for the off label benefits for adhd after trying and failing Vyvanse, Startera, and the usual suspects of stimulants for adhd. 

I know docs and people online tend to be skeptical of such low doses and such high sensitivity to symptoms but I have also seen stories where people have similar experiences. It's strange though since my doc somewhat assured me that this wouldn't happen since the half life of Zoloft is many times longer than Wellbutrin and alas here we are with symptoms 2 weeks out. 

At the end of the day it's my body and I know what I'm feeling is an out of the ordinary specific set of symptoms that are very similar if not identical to what I felt before, indicating as my psychiatrist mentioned that while it may seem out of the ordinary, the field is very young and my sensitivity seems to be something that can defy the usual expectations for symptoms and withdrawal even at the lowest briefest doses. I'll ofc follow up with him, I just was reaching out for solidarity.

"   I started taking zoloft at the age of of 16 from constant over stimulation that had started once i hit puberty at 11 years old. The first few months on zoloft i felt happier than i had ever felt before to a pretty extreme extent. I didnt know this was an odd reaction to ssri’s especially since up to the age of 16 i had never done any drugs. I hadn’t ever even had caffeine before besides the low amount in soda which I rarely ever had. The reason im saying this is because there were nothing in my life i had experienced that was mind altering. This is why i didnt know at the time that i was really, really high on zoloft. Apparently it was obvious to my family who have said it was very obvious something was wrong once I started. I became the most extreme extrovert anyone could ever become. This all lead to me going from a normal 3.0 gpa to graduating with a 1.8 gpa. I became a drug addict in the worst way possible. I had become so impulsive. I went from being a kid who never lies or does anything bad to the guy who lies for no reason. I became a poly addict within months of starting zoloft. I became completely disconnected from not only friends but to my parents as well. This continued for 2 years until i finally stopped taking it at 18. Once i stopped taking zoloft i did a complete 180, well sort of. The addictions i picked up on zoloft for the most part stopped, except for one drug which i still struggle with. That being adderall and vyvanse. Thank the lord i never met anyone with meth during this time. There were other drugs i was addicted too as well while on zoloft like oxycodone, hydrocodone, weed, nicotine, xanax, Klonopin, alcohol and even more. I was addicted to all of these. I couldnt stop thinking about getting high. Its all i thought about. Always thinking of ways to get drugs. My parents had to buy a safe specifically for there prescriptions to keep me from stealing them. Even my own zoloft was in there safe because i would take 4 a day when i was prescribed to take one 50mg. I even abused tylenal(acetaminophen). My parents also couldn’t keep alcohol anywhere in the house since everynight after they went to bed i would search the whole house for it. 

     Like i said though once I turned 18 i stopped taking zoloft and just like that all of my hyper focused drug cravings went away, all of them except for amphetamines which i still struggle with today. Also this isnt really related but when i was 19 i tried molly(mdma) with a friend which i had only had gotten because i started abusing amphetamines again which for some reason amphetamines also make me impulsive, but not to the same level as Zoloft though. Anyways when i took the molly, guess what it felt like?!  It was literally the exact same head space and just over all feeling i had during the first 6 moths on Zoloft. It felt exactly the same, just it only lasted for a few hourse and made me very umm aroused, and a bit hyped.

 Im about to turn 21 in 7 days so it really hasnt been to long since my manic days.




Second time on ssri’s

 Right around when i had turned 20 i began getting my first ever panic attacks. Most of them were the normal panic attacks, well normal probably isn’t the right word. I mean most of the attacks i had i could deal with on my own since they all happened at night when i was alone. One night though that changed. This particular night i felt that dreadful anxiety which i had been feeling for the past couple weeks already but it had never gotten to the point where it was too overwhelming for me deal with on my own. I was just laying in bed going to sleep, then it just happened in less than a second i knew i was gonna die. I knew this was it. I couldn’t breathe or i guess i could breathe but for some reason every time i would inhale it was just like i wasn’t idk. That immediate overwhelming feeling of death is the worst pain i hade ever felt. Worse than any physical pain id ever had, well i guess its the worst thing i’ve ever felt period at least at this point in my life. Because of this i went to the doctor. I refused to take ssri’s for it while also really trying to stay away from benzodiazepines for obvious reasons. So i perscribed Buspiron which is kinda in its on catargory. It’s non addictive and its not an antidepressant. So I took it for just about a month. Made me lowkey feel like shit. Constant headaches along with being really hot which is kinda problem since i work physical labor pretty much only outside all while it’s july. So unfortunately the only other option was ssri’s since im still on my parents health insurance my mom would never in a million years allow me take benzodiazepine which is obviously understandable. So i get a script for prozac cause it’s not Zoloft so maybe it’ll be a little different. Boy oh boy was it different. So basically the prozac ended up doing exactly the opposite of what the Zoloft did. I became more depressed than i had ever been by a landslide. Legit would fantasize killing myself. The first two weeks on prozac i would do nothing. Like straight up nothing but think about how amazing it would be to get relief by  meeting up with my favorite tree. Eventually it went away for the most part. Then i stopped taking it 3 moths ago, so i was on it for 9 months total. I just felt normal on it for the most part. The only other thing it did that was bothersome was make me a little short tempered.


  Ive just been curious if anyone else has experienced something similar to me.

"I've been prescribed Buproprion HCL XL 150mg for long-term depression and intrusive thoughts. As well as a smoking cessation and ADHD treatment.  Been on and off Vyvanse for years now which, at first kicked me into hyperdrive and provided a solid year of lessened depression and tons of motivation. Eventually, the effects went away entirely and I was left with much worse depression and zero attention span.

In the past, I've tried Zoloft, which kind of worked but the side effects kicked my ass. And Trintellex, which was just awful awful awful and made my depression 10 fold.

I'm hesitant to start this med due to fear of having my already abysmal focus worsen and I've heard friends say it causes outbursts of anger or anxiety. But I'm hoping it might give me the energy and willpower to be social again, goto the gym more than once every 4 months, and just give me some gusto and ambition to improve my life again.

I got through the first couple of days feeling really crappy and emotional, then missed a dose and was in HELL within 3 hours.  After another week, I was still having all the bad side effects and decided it was not for me, and that I’d rather go back on Zoloft for the time being. (So really only 8-9 days on it.

I tapered down to 25mg for a couple of weeks, then cross tapered with 25mg Zoloft for another week. (I’m finding out now that was too fast.) I’ve been Pristiq-free for two weeks now. 

The worst of the withdrawal has eased up, but now EVERY DAY AT 2:00 I get horrible nausea and headache and feeling of “carsickness” for the rest of the evening. WTF?? It’s so bizarre, and absolutely debilitating. I can’t function the rest of the day. I’m starting to panic that’s it’s something else entirely! 

Is it common for it to last this long? What can I do?? For additional info, I’m also on 200mg of Lamotrigine (for last 12 years) and I take Vyvanse and Adderall (stimulants.) Please put my mind at ease! What should I do??

"Long block of text:    
    
I was on Zoloft and felt amazing emotionally. The combo of vyvanse and Zoloft was great. However, it was incredibly hard for me to orgasm. That started affecting my anxiety so my psych has had me taper down on Zoloft and start Wellbutrin. I began the process in October. I was on 100 mg’s and the more I tapered down the easier it was to orgasm. But only doing it myself. I still couldn’t from sex but, each time I went down a dose it seemed to get me closer during sex. My psych weaned me down to 25 mg’s and she had me try to stop it completely after that. Had way too many brain zaps so now she has me taking 12.5 mg’s every day. I’m two weeks into that, I am crying every single day and my constant anxiety is back. It dawned on me today that it’s most likely the medication. I emailed her but idk if she’ll get back to me because of NYE tomorrow. I really don’t want to be on SSRI’s anymore. I have a high sex drive and the lack of orgasms is not okay for me. But, the constant crying/anxiety is also detrimental obviously. I feel like I’m having to choose between being emotionally okay or being able to orgasm. I know I can try other stuff. Finding the perfect combo is a tricky task. But I am feeling so defeated right now. Has anyone had this experience and was able to get off SSRI’s? did I need to stick it out for longer and it’ll eventually stop?",1,z
"Hi, I know the first port of call is to see my doctor, but it’s not financially viable for me at the moment, and by the time I can afford it, it won’t matter anymore. Admin delete if it’s too close to requesting medical advice.

Long story short so I’m just mentioning the important bits; I’m on 120mg of Duloxetine/Cymbalta. I have just started Vyvanse for ADHD, and was recommended to drop from 120mg Duloxetine to 60mg. 

The decision to drop right from 120mg to 60mg without any tapering was a group effort. 

I am *fine*, but I’m a bit brain zappy and antidepressant withdrawally (IYKYK). Nowhere near as bad as not taking any for a few days, though. 

My question is - if anyone has prior experience, as it’s something I’ve read people doing before - is it safe/fine for me to just open up a capsule, roughly halve the little balls inside the capsule and take just that half for a week or so? Essentially taking 90mg then drop down to 60mg?

Or do I just… kind of… suffer through it until I’m feeling better?",1,brain zappy
"Hi, I'm just getting really frustrated and wanted to see if anyone has been through this or has suggestions..

I started having really bad social anxiety in 2015 or so but didn't look into medicating it until it manifested really horribly in 2019 or so. It remained present though and I began having severe issues starting things/being productive/motivated. Then early this year, my social anxiety snowballed into a full psychotic break, several day long blackout, and 3 month hospital stay. Ever since then, I have been feeling extremely traumatized and have not made any attempts to socialize and only go to work and appointments (both of which are really difficult for me). I seem to have huge mental blocks that I can't overcome that prevent me from doing anything. I don't want advice saying ""fake it till you make it,"" ""you should go outside and do x."" I genuinely can't find the energy to do anything and lack the motivation to force myself to. That advice is not realistic for me at this time. I tried to book a vacation to escape my surroundings but cancelled it the day of because I didn't have the motivation or clarity to get myself organized or excited. I used to be a huge vacation person.

But I am wondering why none of these medications have been helpful, and wanted to know if anyone has any suggestions, or personal anecdotes:

* Citalopram (made me feel like a cartoon so went off this)
* Effexor (made me feel downright shitty and tired constantly and I think it led to my psych break, tapered off 6 months ago or so)
* Wellbutrin (on this now, felt positive effects for 2 weeks and now am worse than I have been before)
* Vyvanse (stopped, prescribed to help me with my lack of motivation, makes me feel nauseous and sluggish)
* Adderall (on this now, used to work GREAT but stopped working over the last 3 months despite me increasing dosage to 40mg - just makes me angry and not productive)
* Occassionally take Ativan for panic attacks but try not to because I had bad withdrawals early September

I am just so sick of feeling like this and don't understand why nothing helps. I feel I don't have enough dopamine for anything to work but idk if that's a thing. I don't have the mental capacity to exercise or go on a walk so please miss me with that kind of nonsense.

"My (25F) husband (33M) is currently on 70mg Vyvanse/lis (50mg and 20mg, taken early in the morning and at lunchtime respectively), 150mg trazodone (before bedtime) and he has recently started on fluvoxamine 50mg (he's been on lis and trazodone for 1+ years now).

We've both noticed that every time he tries an antidepressant, he'll get terrible coughing, post-nasal drip (I think) and excessive nose/throat clearing. It's nearly constant and it's driving him mad! Not to mention that his throat has likely become irritated with all that clearing etc. It's happened on escitalopram, fluoxetine and now on fluvoxamine. And it goes away when he stops the antidepressant.

He needs the antidepressant, so stopping altogether isn't an option. Why is this happening? Has anyone experienced this and if so, did you find a way to keep it under control or reduce it somewhat?

Our GP is completely useless because he doesn't have very advanced knowledge of psychiatric drugs, and his appointed psychiatrist (via the NHS) couldn't even remember the side effects of Vyvanse when asked about them.

Thanks :)

**edit:** I know trazodone is also an antidepressant, but he's been taking that for 1+ years without this happening. He only takes trazodone for sleep (it helps tremendously), but he needs an additional antidepressant and that's what's causing him issues. The whole thing started happening a few months back, he didn't really have this before.

**edit 2:** I thought I'd update the post with a description of each symptoms. Be warned, it's rather distasteful and might be downright disgusting for some -- apologies!

1. Coughing - to me it sounds like the kind of cough you get when your chest is a bit itchy, so you try to cough to kind of... relieve it I guess? It's dry and 'forced' so to speak, like he can't control the impulse to cough.
2. Throat clearing
3. 'Sniffling' (it may not be the correct word) - like when you have a runny nose, so you do the opposite of blowing it (so the mucus doesn't actually come out). Or like when you've got thick saliva and/or mucus and you try 'swallowing' it to clear up your throat. Apologies for the very disgusting pictures and descriptions, but I'm not sure how else to describe this and I want to make sure it's easy to understand.",1,"coughing, post - nasal drip, nose, throat clearing, runny, mucus"
"I take duloxetine 90mg and I’m on my 6th week.

I’ve had weeks of ups and a bit of downs, but overall lifted my baseline mood and lessened my anxiety from week 1.

Around the 4th week I became a whole new person, more chill and patient than even before my depression and just content. And my anxiety is pretty non existing. Like it has eliminated my negative ruminations and negative perceptions and thoughts BUT it’s had some effects on my cognition i think. 

…. I literally just kind of don’t have thoughts now? Idk how to describe it. I am just where I am, presently. But then I get sucked into whatever I am in, I have no sense of time. I was half studying and half coffee talking with my really good friend and suddenly it went from being 10am to 6pm. I felt like I had been there for only 2-3 hours? 

But paradoxically….. the way I get distracted. Wow. This all happened in like… 5 minutes:

I came home, was going to change into cozy clothes. Said hi to my boyfriend and talk to him for 30 seconds. Then I look at the kitchen counter, I realize I need to eat. I am going to the refrigerator. Before I open it, I’m like hmm. I need to change my clothes. I turn around, see my boyfriend, forget about both food and clothes again. Start talking about something for 2 minutes. Then I am like, i need to change clothes. I walk into my room, open my closet, then I see a blanket on the bed. I leave the closet, pick up the blanket and put it away. I turn around and see my bf again in the entrance and we start talking. 

BASICALLY, it took me 30 whole minutes to even get my clothes changed. This is NOT normal? But idk, it’s better than overthinking lol

Also I have ADHD and take vyvanse when I need it but that doesn’t really change any of the above",1,
"3 days ago I went to my GP for the first time seeking treatment for depression. He believes I have moderate depression on a background of social anxiety and gave me 50mg/day Sertraline and I started taking it immediately. Before then, for more than 3 years straight I'd been the most miserable I've ever been in my life. Progressively got worse until I was bedridden doing literally nothing other than sleeping, eating (alot), crying, planning suicide, failing my course, medicine, which I use to love, for months. Today, I woke up with the usual misery and suicidal ideation. But few hours later in the afternoon I started feeling way better. Like, the numbness was gone. I was still feeling shit, bed ridden and I'm getting the typical depression thoughts of ""This isnt gonna last long"", ""why are you happy for being barely functional?"" or ""it'll be gone tomorrow morning"". Nonetheless, I feel better. I've done recreational vyvanse and mdma before and this felt like the very mild version of those. Just feeling good, relatively speaking. I actually found joy in some little things like watching youtube videos which id lost some time ago. So I got up and showered and cleaned my bed sheets and washed my clothes. Sounds simple, but I hadn't done any of these for more than a month. I havent felt such a lack of shittiness for months, I'm really enjoying it.

I've also never been into music, but yesterday night, out of a desire to feel something (I was numb af), I delved into it and liked some stuff. Been listening since and even this I am enjoying way more today than yesterday. But ya, so music is the only other thing I can pin today on. I dont care either way, I feel some peace at least and havent thought about killing my self for hours. I think I just wanted to share this as much as ask the question.

"I’ve been on Zoloft for about 2.5 years now and it’s been great. However, I do have some side effects, one of which is some emotional blunting. It’s not terrible, it’s not like I’m completely apathetic, but I notice that sometimes things like music and movies won’t deliver as much of an emotional response as I’m used to. 

In addition to Zoloft, I take Vyvanse for ADHD (it’s basically Adderall) and I’ve noticed that my emotional blunting is typically more pronounced on days that I do not take my Vyvanse. I tried Googling and couldn’t come up with anything that directly links amphetamines to improved emotional blunting, but I found [this wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amotivational_syndrome) about amotivational syndrome that mentions pairing SSRIs with a medication that boosts dopamine levels as a way of treating SSRI-induced amotivational syndrome. It reminded me of a conversation I had with my doctor about potentially adding Wellbutrin into the mix for exactly this reason to help counteract some sexual side effects I was having. And then it hit me - amphetamines work by increasing the levels of dopamine in the brain and the Vyvanse might actually be counteracting some of the emotional blunting effects of the Zoloft!

Started with atomoxetine for adhd/anxiety (worked a bit but at some point switched to Zoloft possibly because I built up tolerance). However Zoloft gave me too much daytime sleepiness and slept constantly, no interest in sex, so I switched to celexa which I thought worked like a charm but gave me ED, however when I came off celexa I got Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction which made me completely lose interest in sex, then I tried Wellbutrin that made me jittery, and finally Effexor which is the one I’ve been on for the last few years on and off. Overall it works well for me, I am not completely sure if it gives me daytime sleepiness or not, as I am quite prone to daytime naps (but that may just be a habit/response to stress I picked up during covid lockdowns), but I do get very long dreams (I’m talking dreams that feel like hours long during a 20 minute power nap), and I have struggle reaching climax. As I am in a relatively new relationship (<1 y), initially I assumed we were simply out of the honeymoon phase until it was brought to my attention that venlafaxine/Effexor is notorious for delayed/weakened orgasms. Previously I had been given testosterone to offset the sexual side effects of antidepressants, but I’m finding that with this drugs it’s orgasm (not getting aroused or erect) that is the actual problem.

I know Reddit doesn't like SSRIs because they are like poison to people with anhedonia, but sincerely but the doctor insisted on it, and I rather trust him.

"Been taking 100mg Zoloft for about 17 years, but had enough of the sides and didn't feel it was doing the job overall. Was having a lot of highs and lows, with more lows lately. 

Talked w/ the doc who prescribed 200mg Lamotrigine (worked up slowly to that dose). Once at 200mg, we decided slowly come off the Zoloft. Tapered off and it's been 11 days since any Zoloft. While I'm not having the highs and lows anymore, coming off Zoloft absolutely sucks a giant ass! For the past week or so, I have been the most irritable and cranky dickhead.

My question and concern is will this last much longer, and roughly how long? At what point if I'm feeling the same, do I wave the white flag and retreat back to the Zoloft or some other SSRI? 

It's worth mentioning, doc plans on prescribing Vyvanse (separately for ADD) after another week or two post no Zoloft. Don't know if that would perhaps help what I'm experiencing with the Zoloft withdrawals or make it worse.

"for worst it was prozac and hydroxyzine …….. prozac honestly made depression feel worse. i was so emotional and unstable, crying everyday. when it wasn’t that, i was painfully numb. hydroxyzine was so much worse. granted it helps you sleep, sometimes. but the day after is never worth it.. i end up feeling unbearably tired, sluggish, more depressed. literally mfkin miserable .. i don’t know anyone who has had a good experience with it.

"Hey All, I’m looking for some advice or ideas if anyone has any…

Years ago I was on Wellbutrin as an off label treatment for ADHD with a lot of success. I started on the 150 and then added the 300 a few weeks later. This worked well for a few years until I went off of it to start a family. Then OH MY GOD, I got debilitating vertigo for 6-8 weeks. I didn’t know about stepping down etc, just stupidly went cold turkey… it has been nearly 12 years since. 

I want to go back on it, but when I tried to a few years ago in 2017 the dizziness returned the first day I tried it. So I just stopped 

But now I’m back to really needing some help with my productivity and focus and I hate how Adderall/Vyvanse etc makes me feel…

My doctor said the dizziness should go away after a week or so. Not that I’m sure I can even stand that honestly but I’m desperate.

Has anyone gone off and on Wellbutrin successfully? Without side effects? Or had them go away? It SAVED my life in grad school and I don’t want to give up on it yet…",1,"debilitating vertigo, dizziness, dizziness"
"I just want to share my experience in case anyone else is struggling. 

I lost 100 lbs 6 years ago through exercise and diet. I maintained it nicely for about 2 years. I went up a few pounds here and there since I was quitting smoking, but that’s natural nothing crazy (10lbs max). Then I went on Zoloft (sertraline) for my anxiety. It helped with my mood, but as I increased my dosage I had less control of my hunger/eating. Fast forward to a few months ago I’ve gained 100lbs in 1.5 years on this med, I was getting up every night binging after eating all day until I was disgustingly full. I just couldn’t stop eating. I felt so lost. I had no control. I didn’t know why this was happening. I was in and out of my drs office trying to figure out why this was happening. I tried phentermine and vyvanse but after a week they gave me horrible side effects. Then I started doing my own research about Zoloft and SSRI’s in general. I was floored about how many people gained so much weight on their antidepressant and their dr didn’t say anything or advise them other wise. YES, if the meds really help you get out of a dark please they are worth a few lbs, but for me the weight gain became my main form of anxiety. 

Long story short. I changed to Wellbutrin last Monday and holy shit. I’m a new person. I haven’t binged all week (it’s been over a year since I could say that), I’ve exercised consistently, I feel like I have control back. I’m also down 7lbs. Every medication reacts differently with different people, but this is my experience and maybe it’s worth asking your provider if you had a similar feeling/binge pattern.",1,
"i was put on prozac, then zoloft 75 mg. i also take vyvanse and occasionally hydroxyzine. 

ever since my meds really started to kick in i’ve felt almost dazed, demented, lucid, idk any better way to explain it other than saying, half there. 

i feel like i have less thoughts in general, i can hardly remember what i’ve been doing ever since i’ve been put on them. i don’t remember how i felt, or if i even felt anything. It’s not good or bad, i just feel like i want to wake up, and be free from the control they have over me.",1,"##ented, ##ucid"
"19f, ADHD Inattentive. Have tried Concerta, Vyvanse, Adderall, either didn’t work or side effects were too severe.

I started bupropion yesterday, and my side effects were quite unlike what my doctor had described to me (agitation, headache, irritability, dry mouth, anxiety, etc…) so I’m wondering if anyone else has had this experience, and, if so, if these feelings went away.

About two hours in, my body began to feel “heavy,” and i began to have a very “flat”/empty feeling. I felt like I was having to work very hard to appear normal to my classmates. My already-problematic brain fog increased significantly. This escalated into me feeling incredibly spaced out, and as if my mind were completely blank.

Later in the day, this feeling got worse and I began to feel very detached from myself, and I think at that point it became difficult to hide. I blamed it on a headache and went home from sports early, but on my walk home I felt like I was almost in a dream, as if i was floating and just watching life pass by without actually being a part of it in the present. 

This feeling persisted and when one of my friends called me, I had an incredibly hard time really hearing everything she was saying, and there were moments in where my mind went completely blank when i would have to respond and my end of the phone would just go silent, and she would ask “you there?” and I would blame it on bad connection or something.

No notable positive effects on my motivation, mood, energy, or ADD, which is what it was mainly prescribed for. Perhaps some of my overthinking/anxiety was quieted, but just because my head was so empty. Not sure it was a great trade.

I am really discouraged, because i really want this medicine to work for me, but I can’t find many anecdotes with these symptoms that didn’t end up having to switch.

Did anyone else begin with these symptoms? And if so, how did it end for you?",1,"irritability, dry mouth"
"So, I'm still pretty early on in this whole zoloft experiment. Last week, I was having some insomnia, which I suspect was because it was extending the half-life of my vyvanse somehow. Lowering the dosage seemed to have fixed it. I raised it again today to see if the pattern truly exists. It might have also just been coincidental timing with my neck pain, since I hadn't gotten to exercise properly in a couple of weeks, and I finally did Saturday.

"Hi, I am 21F, 119lbs, currently taking 40mg vyvanse and 75mg zoloft. 

I started vyvanse a bit over a month ago at 30mg. My dr. increased my dose to 40mg, yesterday was my first day. When I started 30mg, I had no bad side effects, besides a crash about halfway through my day. Other than that, i’ve concluded that vyvanse is the perfect ADHD medication for me (i’ve tried other medication), and that I want to stay on it. 

My life has improved a lot since starting, however since the increase in dose i’ve had a constant low-grade headache. Yesterday was my first day on 40mg, and it hit me pretty hard. Not too hard, but I could feel a drastic increase in my productivity, the peak felt a bit higher, and overall I had a better day with no crash. However, I started to get a headache in the evening (about 5pm) (also note that i took my medication at 10am yesterday), and it has not gone away since. 

It’s now 5pm the next day and I still have this low grade headache. I’ve been eating the same, I slept well, I drink plenty of water, I have one electrolyte packet a day, I take vitamin B12 and D every morning, as well as magnesium at nighttime. I took ibuprofen yesterday hoping to help the headache but it didn’t. This morning i took aspirin along with acetaminophen and nothing has changed. I’m also not feeling as “wired” today as I usually am, is that due to the headache I would assume? I have been taking breaks between studying/doing assignments which I never used to do on 30mg and I didn’t do that yesterday on my first dose of 40mg. 

Anyways my question is, will this go away soon? I don’t think my dose is too high, as yesterday I felt amazing. Any advice on how to help it? When will I know if I need to go back down to 30mg? ",1,
"TLDR- super long post, been on Suboxone for a while (was stable at 4mg twice a day for a few mos), recently started taking Vyvanse. (On 70mg now), since getting on a higher dose of Vyvanse mg Suboxone feels less effective. (I’ve needed to take 8mg twice a day now to feel comfy and normal. No major WD symptoms- just uncomfortable and more pain and not myself and restless legs a little and just crappy feeling) I feel better after dosing. I feel better since doubling my dosage. Want to get off suboxone eventually and prefer lower dose. Wondering what the correlation is. Seeing my dr next week. Does Vyvanse cause suboxone to be less effective or to metabolize suboxone faster? Last, does suboxone cause Vyvanse to be less effective? 70mg doesn’t feel completely therapeutic and it doesn’t last long enough. Thanks!

I’m 33 female. 5’2 170lbs. 

I take Vyvanse, Suboxone, Gabapentin, Trazodone, Clonidine, Hydroxyzine PRN, Zofran PRN, and Tylenol and Ibuprofen like clock work.

Magnesium supplements, and a relaxation nootropic blend that contains ashwaganda, 5htp, passion flower, GABA, B vitamins, L-theanine, lemon balm extract, Barcopa monnied extract, and passion flower extract. 

Been stable on Suboxone for awhile. 4mg twice a day. I’ve been sober for 16 months.

Background- I’m 33 yo. I got in a car accident when I was 16yo and broke my back. I was prescribed heavy amounts of opiates, Valium, and gabapentin for years. I never had surgery. I wore a heavy duty back brace from lower back to neck for a while then got switched to one that just from under my breasts to my waistline. I was prescribed all those meds for years until I was no longer on my parent’s insurance. (So like 16yo to 21 yo) 

I got cut off from my meds abruptly. At that time I was both dependent and addicted to the oxys. It was during a time that pain pills were overly prescribed so I had no problem getting them from people I knew from high school- they’d get them from their parents. I had a few people I’d buy them from monthly. 

When I was like 22-23 I moved to a different area with my SO and we planned to work and go to school. That went horribly wrong. He was addicted to pain pills as well. (We started dating when we were 17 and we’re actually still together now. I shared my pain pills with him starting when we first started dating.)

We were trying to find pain pills but didn’t know anyone from the area and ended ho on heroin.We did that for maybe 6-8 months. We couldn’t do it anymore or afford it so we both got on methadone. Were clean on methadone for like 8 years. I was actually up to 220mg. I started tapering after years of being sober and got down to 30mg and switched over to suboxone. I was sober on that for years. 

Then in 2022 we had a relapse on cocaine and after a few months we were introduced to crack cocaine. We got addicted to that pretty much immediately. 

I was still on Suboxone but it wasn’t working right on the crack. My suboxone doctor told me that it’s not effective in crack. I would forgot to take my suboxone doses sometimes here and there. My SO started doing H again (it ended up being all fentanyl, I was being drug tested at the time at my suboxone clinic and it didn’t come up with heroin or any other opiates). I started doing it too, just small amounts for the crack comedown. I would still take my suboxone though. Eventually it was to the point where I had missed 2-3 days of my suboxone and then I tried to take it and I went into precipitated withdrawal. I didn’t intentionally get off the suboxone but I could no longer take it because I was addicted to fentanyl and the suboxone got out of my system. I couldn’t go 72 hrs without fentanyl to get back on suboxone. I have such a high opiate tolerance. I wasn’t even getting high AT ALL on the fentanyl. The clinic said I had the highest level of fentanyl in my system then they’d ever seen and it’s a big place in a decently sized town. Kept doing fentanyl for a few months (6ish months total). 

I had to turn myself into jail to get on the house arrest bracelet in mid May of last year. I couldn’t stop smoking crack or doing fentanyl. I had to pee clean to get the bracelet. I quit the crack like a week before. I knew I’d withdrawal in jail and still couldn’t quit the fentanyl . I didn’t know about comfort meds you could get from the dr or in detox. I thought you just go through full blow withdrawals. I got on methadone a few months before that. I got up to 100mg and it was doing nothing for the withdrawals. I couldn’t even cut back on my fentanyl use. 

Turned myself in and sat there 12 days until I tested clean. Took that long for the fentanyl to be out of my system. Then when I got out I got back on Suboxone. 

After a few months I got the Sublocade shot for several months. I had to get higher than recommended shots and still had to take Suboxone on top of that. Finally I got off the Suboxone and was fine just on the sublocade. 

Several months after my last Sublocade injection I started having withdrawals so I decided to go back on the suboxone strips. I’ve been on Suboxone again for 4 months and been sober 16 months. 

Recently started Vyvanse. I’m now on 70mg once a day. I’ve tried 50mg in AM and 20mg in afternoon. My doctor says whatever works best. I’m still trying to figure that out. I’ve been on Vyvanse for maybe 3 months. 

Now that I’m on a higher dose of Vyvanse, I feel like the Suboxone is much less effective. 

I’m prescribed 8mg twice times a day. I was on that dose for a month. Then I started taking 4mg twice a day instead with no withdrawals and I preferred taking that instead. I never got my dosage changed from my doctor though, she left the practice and I’ve just been seeing a PA for appts so far. Meeting my new dr next week finally. 

I’m now back to taking 8mg twice a day. Since being on 50mg of Vyvanse for a few days. I noticed that I just was feeling “off”. I’m not sure if the Vyvanse is making me metabolize my Suboxone quicker? The PA was acting like that is not a thing. I know that cocaine and crack caused that to happen and my dr at the time said that was completely normal and basically unavoidable. I’ve never been on amphetamines.

I have a dr appt next week and I’ll talk to him then about it. I was going to get my prescription changed for 8mg a day split between morning and night but now I feel like I need 16mg total. 

What are your thoughts? I’ve done a lot of research on Google and Reddit and haven’t found any info. A couple people on Reddit have said they were in Vyvanse and Suboxone and they didn’t have that issue. They said the issue was the Vyvanse not being as effective. A couple people mentioned that they were actually able to decrease their Suboxone amount on Vyvanse because it can help with the withdrawals. I feel the opposite. 

I feel restless legs and decrease in mood and pain. When I take my Suboxone though I feel completely better. I’m not having full blow withdrawals at all. But I feel uncomfortable and when I take the higher dose of Suboxone I feel normal. I want to get off Suboxone so I was happy to only be on 8mg a day. I don’t want to be taking 16mg a day.

Also, just curious if Suboxone lessens the Vyvanse effects like others have told me on Reddit who are prescribed both. Because even at 70mg I don’t feel totally therapeutic. That’s why my psychiatrist is having me try 50mg in AM and 20mg later or 70mg at once. Vyvanse has definitely changed my life for the better. Just surprised how high my dose is and that it’s not completely effective like I read other people’s experiences. I still struggle A LOT with symptoms and it not lasting as long as it’s supposed to. 

Someone said maybe I feel like I need more Suboxone to “even me out from the Vyvanse”. I guess that could be a possibility. I do not feel all energetic or anything from my Vyvanse dose. If I exercise all crazy I feel weird from it, like jittery, but only very briefly. 

Thank you to anyone who actually read this whole post. Took me several different sittings to write out. Hope it makes sense. I will take any advice or ideas or anything!! 

I would also like some feedback about it to share with my doctor at my appt next week. It took me a long time to find a dr that I like and trust with my care and she’s no longer there anymore. This dr I’m seeing will be completely new to me and some doctors can be very dismissive. Also he’s not an addiction specialist or anything. Just a primary care doctor who is able to prescribe Suboxone and he is also a resident doctor so I wanted some input on here that might be helpful for me to share with him when I bring this up just incase he doesn’t take my concerns seriously. 

Thank you and please help!!

Also to add- I don’t smoke, but I do vape nicotine. No illegal substances. Been smoking since I was 16. Quit cigarettes and switched to vaping several years ago.

Sorry this is so long. Wanted to provide as much info as possible. This is my third time trying to submit a post and it keeps getting denied for not enough info. Hope this one goes through! Thanks!",1,"restless, restless legs, decrease in mood, ##tter"

"Hi, i’m a 23F and I am diagnosed ADHD/Autistic with Intellectual Impairment, I have been taking Vyvanse for 6 months. I recently increased my dose from 40mg to 60mg (only last week). I vape as well and take Estelle birth control. 

I have been recently been doing research about tolerance and stimulants. I read (and advised by my psychiatrist) that “breaks” and magnesium seem to combat the tolerance issue and to help combat side affects from the medication. 

So i took my 60mg vyvanse through the week and 500mg magnesium enjoyed it no issues. I felt like i could sleep better and really enjoyed how the magnesium felt, i had no issues. But then i took about 3 days off the medication as my psych recommended it to help with my tolerance.

Forward to today, I had a bit of jump scare last night. I took my Vyvanse around 10:00am and around 6pm i felt my usual crash and headache - this is my usual sign that I know the medication has mostly worn off. 

I had 500mg Magnesium at 9pm and got ready for bed. Around 12am i started feeling jittery, my heart was racing and my headache disappeared almost like my meds kicked in again? At 1:30am, all of the sudden i felt like i was vibrating in my body, i felt confused and i think i either fell asleep or passed out. I don’t know exactly what happened i just don’t remember the entire hour at all, it scared me, it made me feel like something bad happened i’d never felt this way before. im worried i had a seizure or something but im most likely over reacting! It’s currently 3:30am while i’m writing this and im wide awake.. This terrified me as i have zero recollection from before the point when I noticing i felt like my insides were vibrating. 

I am really disappointed as my bloods have consistently showed magnesium levels have been low since i was a teen and i was really hoping I could continue the magnesium as i suffer from muscle cramps regularly and heard great things about adding magnesium with vyvanse. I was just wondering if there was any contraindications or something i need to be doing differently as I am quite shaken up and quite scared and never want to take magnesium again!",1,

Meds- Vyvanse 30mg, Propranolol, non smoker but do use nicotine pouches 3mgs 

I’ve been on Vyvanse for the last 6 months. I started at 20mg went to 30mg and then was put on 50mg. I want to note that I also have POTs. I have had my heart checked with ECG and heart monitor. Tests came back fine. I also check my heart rate and BP 3x/day. I take propranolol as needed to help if BP elevates. 

My first dose of the 50mg made me feel awful and quite honestly it was scary. My left side neck muscles were very tight, my right arm was slightly numb. I also felt like I didn’t have complete control of my right arm, almost like there was a half second delay. Lastly, my chest felt tight.  I’ve now been back on 30mg for about two months. I’ve noticed that if I’m on my feet for a long time or constantly standing up and then sitting down my heart rate will spike and then suddenly drop. That then causes my BP to rise. I call it the “surge”. It’s like a wave or something flashes through me. I get pale for just a moment and I get very disoriented. Almost like I’m slightly dissociating. I then again get the right arm numbness. I also sometimes get a scratchy voice for 1-2 hrs and then it goes away. 

I spoke to my doctor about this and he said he’s never had a patient experience these symptoms.  I’m being referred to a neurologist but that will likely be 3-4 months before I can get in. 

Also, to throw another crazy plot twist I recently had a mammogram and have BI-RAD4c >3 microclusters with extremely dense breast tissue. My doctors did get me in for biopsy this upcoming Friday.

"24F, 5ft9, 135 lbs. Diagnosed with ADHD in 2022, got on meds (vyvanse) in 2023. My grandpa and both of my uncles on my mom's side also had fainting spells their whole lives. They all died of aortic dissection between the ages of 38 and 46.

I've been going to the doctor's on and off since I was 13 for my fainting spells. The first doctor at 13 told me it was puberty and that I'd grow out of it. When I was 15 I fainted while going up the stairs and hit my head. I suffered a head wound and a concussion, but was almost immediately discharged from the ER after they'd disinfected the head wound. I was ordered 6 weeks of bed rest at home. That I fainted wasn't unusual according to the ER doc because I was skinny (not underweight skinny, just regular weight skinny). When I was 18 I went to see a doctor again who swore up and down it was ""just the monthlies"" and that my cycle was throwing me into ""the typical female hysterics"", causing me to pass out. When I was 20, another doctor told me that ""all young women pass out sometimes"" and the fact that I was worried about was indicative of histrionic PD according to him, and I'd be better suited in a mental facility because ""had there really been something wrong with you, especially given your family history, you'd have a diagnosis already""

When I was 22 I finally managed to convince a doctor to refer me to neurology, where the neurologist in question was on his phone the whole time I explained my symptoms to him, then decided to play whack-a-mole on my joints, concluded my reflexes are all intact and diagnosed me with functional neurological disorder and referred me to a therapist. With how that appointment went I don't exactly believe the diagnosis, nor does my therapist.

Diagnosed with add and bulimia 

Initially, I was prescribed 30mg Vyvanse for my ADD and bulimia, but over time, my dosage increased to 60mg. Since the Vyvanse would wear off mid-day, my doctor prescribed 10mg of Adderall as a supplemental dose. I started taking Vyvanse in October 2017.

However, I made the decision to discontinue the use of ADHD medications in order to avoid dependence. In June 2022, I stopped taking both medications. Due to the significant withdrawal symptoms I experienced, I discussed with my doctor the option of tapering off Vyvanse. I gradually reduced the dosage to 30mg of Vyvanse. It took around three months for my body to return to normal, but then my ADD symptoms resurfaced. As a result, I started taking 10mg of Adderall twice a day.

In December 2022, I made the decision to stop taking Adderall again. However, I'm still experiencing what I believe are withdrawal symptoms. I frequently suffer from daytime sleepiness, often relying on caffeine to stay awake, but sometimes the fatigue is so intense that I have no choice but to sleep. It feels like my brain is constantly low on energy, similar to a battery with very little charge. I have undergone tests for vitamin D deficiency, vitamin B12 levels, and TSH, all of which came back normal. I also had a CBC test done, which showed normal results.

I'm wondering why I am still experiencing these symptoms even though it has been five months since I stopped taking the medications. I'm concerned about whether this is normal and why it's happening.

TLDR I took Vyvanse and Adderall for five years, discontinued Adderall four months ago, and stopped Vyvanse in June 2022. I'm still feeling withdrawal symptoms, specifically extreme fatigue. Despite normal test results for vitamin D deficiency, vitamin B12, TSH, and CBC, I'm unsure why these symptoms persist. I'm seeking understanding as to whether this is a normal occurrence and the reasons behind it.",1,

I experienced infrequent palpitations and cold extremities while taking vyvanse at 40 mg, psych said get cardio workup. ECG showed left axis deviation and evidence of “deconditioning” due to me not being active and LAFB. echo normal. 30 day heart monitor showed infrequent pvc and fast heart rate, dr said no reason i can’t take stimulants. told me to get exercise which i have. he said pvc and fast heart rate and all of this is because i’m out of shape. 5’6” 230 lbs.

vyvanse stopped working through midday so dose was upped to 50 mg. about 2/3 weeks in, episodes of pvc increased dramatically when i took meds. i would feel 5-6 in a minute sometimes with tachycardia which would make me very anxious. propranolol helps but only for a little while. but i also started to get pvc when not on meds whenever i was active. climbing stairs, walking vigorously, etc i would feel them. mentioned this to cardiologist and asked for another monitor since episodes were different and my meds were increased. he was entirely unconcerned- said it was normal, my 30 day monitor was normal albeit a bit fast with pvcs, and that even though i increased my meds and have them much more frequently, he is entirely unconcerned. no need for any testing, and i can increase propranolol if i want. 

i am asking for reassurance please or maybe if i am right to feel concerned about this. i am rather out of shape. my hr is usually in 80’s not on meds and when i take propranolol on meds. is any of this concerning? this med saves my life but isn’t worth V-Fib or sudden cardiac death. i’ve been taking vyvanse for a year now. took them previously unprescribed 2019-mid 2020 then stopped until 2022 when i got prescribed. i’m scared i get dismissed bc of my health anxiety. thank you so much for reading.",1,"##alpitations, cold extremities, pvc, pvc"

"Hi all. 

I don't know how much help this sub can offer, but I had a few questions about a medication I've recently started taking (Vyvanse 30mg OD/AM), and a medication I've been taking for... a couple years, I think? (Lexapro, 30mg OD/HS). I also take 25-50mg trazodone at night for sleep. 

I'm a transgender man, I'm post top surgery, I've been on T for a little over 7 years. I'm a daily cannabis user (I smoke under a gram a day, most days. Just something to unwind in the evenings. Every once in a while I'll be indulgent and have a ""break day"" which consists of an edible and a bowl that I nurse slowly). I doubt any of the trans stuff is relevant, but I know THC can increase heart rate (and usually does for me).

So. My question.

The first day I took Vyvanse was a bit of a doozy that I have to go into, because I don't know how much any of it would have caused a significant effect. 

The night before I went to take my dose of Lexapro and trazodone, and realized I only had 1/3 of a dose of my Lexapro left. Pharmacies were all closed, my partner said he'd grab it when our pharmacy opened at 9am and drop it off for me at work.

He gets to the pharmacy to pick up my meds and finds out that the paperwork for special coverage for my long-awaited Vyvanse script finally went through (read: I could finally afford to try it), so he grabbed that too. 

I was miserable at work. Had slept maybe 3 hours, my brain was pretty pissed about the lack of meds. I spent the first two and a half hours trying to keep my eyes open and my brain from turning into mush. My partner drops off my meds and asks if I want to try the Vyvanse. I usually do NOT try meds like that while I'm working, but at that point I figured I couldn't feel any shittier and said why not. Popped both pills at around 0930 (20mg Lexapro, 30mg Vyvanse).

10:45 hits and I'm talking to a coworker and all of a sudden I realize that I don't dread every word I have to listen to and process, and I don't dread opening my mouth to respond. I do not feel like falling asleep standing up. My stomach isn't on fire, I'm not bent over vomiting into my trash can like I thought I would be (bad experience with Concerta and Straterra). I felt... *good.* I felt awake, and focused, and for the first time after a 3-month spiral of intense clinical depression, I felt like my brain was... producing dopamine? Of all things. 

My med schedule goes back to normal. Lexapro at night, Vyvanse in the morning. Did some research the effects of both medications on the cardiovascular system (my psych ordered an ECG before he upped my Lexapro to 30mg, so I know there are risks involved), was a little nervous about the takeaway re: heart rhythm and serotonin syndrome.

But I have NEVER had the same feeling I had the first day. Vyvanse seems easier for my body to process, but I'm still getting the diarrhea I got on Concerta, I'm struggling with nausea when it starts wearing off, my energy is kind of meh. I feel better than I did without the Vyvanse, don't get me wrong, but I'm wondering if taking the Lexapro at the same time had some sort of effect? 

So I guess my question is: 

Will taking Lexapro in the morning at the same time as my Vyvanse increase the likelihood of SS or cardiovascular symptoms? Does spreading them out over a couple hours make it ""softer"" on my body than shoving both down my gullet at rhe same time? Is it likely that the Lexapro was to thank for the amazing first day, or was it just the effects of taking a stimulant after a really shit night? 

My initial thought was placebo, but what happened was the *exact* opposite of what I expected to. I expected to feel like shit. To puke and have diarrhea and brain fog and the jitters. So I guess it's not placebo.

If anyone can help, that would be amazing. I can't get in to see my psych until the end of the month, but I have that appointment booked. I just want to know if it's something worth trying before that appointment.",1,"heart rate, heart rhythm, serotonin syndrome, diarrhea, ss, cardiovascular symptoms, ##ke, diarrhea, brain fog, ##tters"

I had to get updated on some vaccines since im a medical student, and i noticed the bandages were also soaked. Not too bad, but more than what i'm used to seeing. 

The only thing i can think of thats contributing to this is 1) the vyvanse or 2) the extra water i've been drinking (vyvanse makes my mouth dry).

"42, Female,diagnosed @39 with ADHD. Will try not to ramble too long, here’s the synapses. Was prescribed Vyvanse over 2 years ago. Eventually got to 70mg, Struggled with that afternoon crash. Dr had me try a few various boosters in both adderal and Ritalin families. None really helped at all just made me feel flush and heart race. So i learned to balance water intake, reminding myself to eat, sleeping regular. Wasn’t always great but felt like i was finally figuring out a routine. Then boom, issue with pharmacy and getting the med filled. The beginning of January was the last I took it. Cold Turkey, Doc was sympathetic but because of insurance i had trouble getting another pharmacy to fill until February. So over a month off. Was a rough 2 weeks of withdrawal then I felt ok but so scatterbrained! Finally 2/11 i got the prescription! But now 5th day back on and i feel HORRIBLE!

I have no choice but to power through. Follow up with doc Is not until next month. She’s good with e-mail response but i need to get some more info. Been trying to research all day.

"I had been on Vyvanse since the middle of June and two days ago, I saw my psychiatrist and she told me that it's making me more depressed and it's not working, besides it giving me a boost of energy and lessening the desire to take naps during the day. I wasn't sure if it increased my ability to focus since I was only put on it so I could acclimatise to my last week of uni but my mum only bought it a week after it finished. So I wasn't in an environment that it would be useful, I guess. 


I don't remember what happened on day one of not taking my meds, besides falling asleep next to my bf in his bed and being unable to do so when he was not next to me. I did feel really tired though so I went to bed early. Cue today, where I'm basically nodding off standing up and the only thing keeping me awake is staring at my phone. I was out of bed, but I just didn't have the energy, so I was lying in bed. On top of tiredness and lethargy, I just feel depressed. Like I don't have the energy to do anything.

September last year I started on 20mg of Vyvanse (lowest dose) to combat fatigue I've experienced the last few years, previously diagnosed with ADHD as a teenager. Things were going well until November I started experiencing severe cramping/swelling and terrible muscle pains. 

All blood tests kept coming back normal and I couldn't work it out.  Since stopping the Vyvanse 5 weeks ago my symptoms have greatly reduced (haven't had to go to the emergency room or have a ring cut off my finger AGAIN) but I'm still experiencing sore knees/ankles/wrists and its really impacting my life, I work construction and my pregnant partner does not want to hear that I'm the one that's sore.

"Hi, I'm 18M (19 in a few days), 183cm in height, 81kg in weight, white British, have IBS, Asperger's syndrome, major depression, generalised anxiety and ADHD. I vape with nicotine-containing liquid regularly, do not drink and do not take recreational drugs (though I have in the past).

My medications include (daily) mirtazapine 30mg, pregabalin 600mg (for pain), quetiapine 100mg (for sleep), lisdexamfetamine 50mg, propranolol 40mg (for anxiety, taken at night), hyoscine butylbromide, sodium picosulfate and an azelastine/fluticasone propionate nasal spray. I also started taking varenicline for smoking cessation a few days ago.

I was prescribed Elvanse (lisdexamfetamine) a few weeks ago and it seems to be really helping with my ADHD symptoms but some concerns. My titration has been to increase the dose by 10mg weekly, starting at 20mg and finishing at 60mg. The lower doses did almost nothing to help and I found caffeine to be more useful (stopped taking caffeine as dose got higher), but at around 40mg I started to notice some beneficial effects on my ADHD symptoms.

I went up to 50mg a couple of days ago but have started experiencing some side effects which I wasn't really getting at the lower doses. I feel quite anxious/on edge, slightly overstimulated, and feel some light tightness in my chest. I have felt tightness in my chest and palpitations many times in the past, but have had plenty of ECGs and have always been told it's completely psychological. My blood pressure is 135/82 with a pulse of 91 but this has stayed pretty much constant and was almost exactly the same before I started the medication.

However, I am noticing much more beneficial effects in terms of my ADHD symptoms at this dose and am worried that if I revert to a lower dose, the effects will eventually wear off substantially (as many report they do) and the lower dose will be too little in the long-term.

I would greatly appreciate any advice on this subject. I have mentioned the anxiety to the doctor but they've just told me to keep an eye on it and let them know. I also report my blood pressure/change in symptoms weekly.

Bactrim 800mg/160mg BID

To start with, I made another post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/wx65k4/suffered_a_12cm_laceration_to_ankle_that_nearly/) but it didn't get any traction at all. I can be really wordy, especially when I'm anxious, but it provides a lot of background and obviously my suspicions were correct. the **tl;dr is I suffered a serious laceration during an accident, got staples, and now have an infection. The doctors I've seen have appeared unconcerned and I can't get any proper wound care instructions. Culture came back as ""heavy s. aureus growth"", ""heavy skin flora growth"" and ""minor gram negative bacteria growth"".**

Shortly after I made the post above, I went to the ER as I didn't think it could wait - the cellulitis had broken down quite a bit more and drained a huge amount and it looked like I had a small crater under the staples. The doctor described it as having drained, prescribed me cephalexin, and advised me to keep my appointment to have a look at the wound and have my staples out in a few days with my GP.

I live an an area with a severe doctor shortage - it's estimated about 50% of the population in my city can't find a GP due to it being an undesirable city and the province having essentially gone to war with physicians over compensation during the pandemic. On arrival at my doctor's office, I waited around two hours past my appointment time, and only got in because several people before me got angry and left.

On entering my room, my doctor just pointed at the table until I got on it and unwrapped my bandages. He stared at the infection for a few seconds from his desk before simply saying ""That's bad."" I asked if the wound had healed enough to take the staples out and he wordlessly removed them, then instructed me to rewrap the open wound with the bandage I had been wearing, despite it being soaked through with purulent exudate and having been left in a pile on the bed. I asked a number of questions about followups for diabetes (random blood sugars had been fine, but I have unexplained pitting edema) and about care, which he didn't respond to, as well as when I should schedule a followup appointment. I figured he was thinking and read over his shoulder a bit of his notes when he started typing, where he described it as ""Septic ++++++ ankle wound"". He then printed off a referral for a home care nurse and handed it to me without telling me what it was or how Homecare worked. I expected him to acknowledge or answer at least some of the things I'd asked about, but he just said ""Okay, we're done"" and gestured for me to leave. I repeated that I didn't know how to take care of the wound properly and he said ""I'm hoping they will help with that"" before turning away. The entire visit, I don't think he said more than 10 words collectively.

The wound continued to get worse while I waited for homecare to contact me. With the long weekend, I assumed it might be a few more days and went into the ER as the wound had turned black and continued to smell very bad and soak through my bandages daily. I was triaged for a good 6 hours and on arrival the doctor seemed to be nonplussed about why I had come in - I explained I was worried it wasn't healing and that I was now out of antibiotics. He gave me a prescription for a week of bactrim and had a wound culture performed. He advised me that it looked like it was too dry and had a nurse come in with an adhesive-backed padded dressing of some sort to keep it moist.

I still haven't been able to figure out what happened with my home care referral - I'm suspicious it never actually got faxed - so I left the dressing on for two days, figuring it was better to have a slightly older dressing than dry the wound out again. By the second day, it looked and smelled like a spoiled ground beef container, and I resorted to changing back to my sterile dressings. I was really shocked at how much more tissue had disintegrated and how deep the hole now is, and I'm worried that I might be very close to a point of no return. The wound smells so badly that it's the only thing I can smell most of the time, and it worries me that I have no pain, itching, or tingling, when I had all three for most of the time I was infected.

Am I overreacting to a bad looking infection that isn't as bad as I'd feared? Did I get a collection of bad doctor's visits? I don't know what to do besides continue to go back to the ER and try to work on 2 hours of sleep. I feel like I'm in a slow motion horror movie and I'm watching my body rot.",1,

"I've always known I have ADD and was formally diagnosed about 3 months ago. My doctor and I decided to take the medication route. I started with a few medications that I didn't particularly care for, until I changed to vyvanse. I love the vyvanse, but while I was on it I would sometimes get a very tight feeling in my throat. It felt like my airways were constricting (though it didn't impact actual breathing efficiency, it just makes it feel more difficult)\^1, and it felt similar to asthma. Like a wheeze, but without the wheezing noises or vibrations. Just a very tight and constricted feeling in the area below my adam's apple and above that dip in the clavicle. I also feel the need to cough when it happens, though I don't cough anything up and I don't actually wheeze during it. I almost went to the hospital because of it once, it freaks me out.

I recently moved to a new state and have not lived here for a Spring yet, and I have bad allergies. So, I thought it was an allergic reaction and I set up an appointment to get allergy tested. Unfortunately, there is no test for amphetamines, it's just trial and error for the most part. So, my next step was to change medications. I had an appointment yesterday and was switched over to adderall and the same feeling is happening again today. What could be causing this? Is it preventable? Should I be worried? Has anyone else experienced something similar to this? Are there any measures I can take for this to not happen?

An important note to add to this is that it only happens sometimes. I can take the medication without noticing anything weird going on with my throat. I'd say \~50% of the time it's moderate, \~25% it's severe, and \~25% I don't notice anything. I took adderall/vyvanse a couple dozen times in college and this never happened. I typically don't take the medications over the weekends, and I don't notice any throat issues. However, my weekend activities are very different than my work day activities. 

If anyone knows what could be causing this or how to make it stop that would be amazing. Medication for my ADD has made a very positive impact on my life, and I would very much prefer to continue treatment via medication. Thanks in advance for your replies.

1. When I was getting allergy tested I had the tight throat feeling. I had a test that measured lung efficiency. I had my mouth over some device and would blow out as hard as possible until my lungs were completely empty, then take the biggest possible breath in. My scores were all above average. This is why I don't think it actually affects my ability to breath, it just feels like it.",1,"feeling, ##stricted, tight throat feeling"

I have been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and social anxiety. I have been medicated by Vyvanse in addiction to being on-and-off different SSRI's and SNRI's and some occasional intake of Propanolol/Diazepam for social/panicky situations.

I am an expat in Australia and I am about to leave the country for good, going back to where Vyvanse is unapproved as an ADD/ADHD medication. I have managed to obtain a year's supply of it for myself to bring with me back home (the Middle East, Gulf countries region).

&#x200B;

* ***Now***, this post is relevant to my sibling which I listed his information above, this is about inquiring about a way for my bother, who has ADD and similar symptoms and has undergone Atomoxetine treatment which did not suit him, and I thought Lisdexamphetamine would be highly beneficial for him as it went very well for symptoms which are similar to him.

The main issue here is how to get it prescribed to him from a doctor overseas in one of the countries that have it approved. I tried speaking to few psychiatrists in here of different states who offer video calls consultations but won't prescribe a scheduled substance to a person abroad, even with an endorsement letter of his local psychiatrist, and I was told the patient needs to reside in the same state as the doctor, as per Australian guidelines. It is importation if it was prescribed, being purchased online, should not be an issue with our regional customs if the paperwork for clearance were followed accordingly, that if it was successfully prescribed to him.

&#x200B;

Or as a last resort, for him to travel to one of these countries and obtain it there, which would be painful, especially a doctor will not prescribe repeat scripts until a month trial at least, that, and the costly travel expenses in addition to the high cost of Vyvanse itself.

&#x200B;

If any soul in here has any helpful insight, experience, opinion or advice for this situation please do have your input. Would be highly appreciated as his wellbeing is important to mine and he has been through a lot lately.

Over almost a year now and Vyvanse been the most effective medication to treat these issues, and I have been on Dexamphetamine and Ritalin before and did not find it practical enough in treating my symptoms given its short half-life and the compulsive need to redose that comes with it, and potentially the abuse potential I have had fallen in.

It is a shame it is still highly restricted in most of the world because of its parent compound even with its low potential for abuse, rather than being regulated monitored as properly.",1,

I've been on Vyvanse and Intuniv for about a year, for ADHD-PI (diagnosed by a PhD psychologist during a full psych eval in 2013), plus the hydrochlorothiazide for high blood pressure (was running about 160/90 before medication.

During that same 2013 psych eval, I was also diagnosed with an Anxiety Disorder (Not Otherwise Specified). While taking my girlfriend to the doctor, I struck up a conversation with a very friendly and knowledgable nurse practitioner I know. I live in a medically underserved area, so NP's, PA's and General Practitioners pick up about all the mental health cases as well, meds-wise.

She mentioned that she'd seen a ton of people who were treated for ADHD but not for their anxiety, and that only treating one seemed to make the other worse. This struck a chord with me as it is the exact thing that I have been experiencing during my treatment for ADHD with these stimulants and the alpha-2a agonist, guanfacine, which I was hoping would alleviate the anxiety this go around, but has not quite done the trick.

Meeting with my doctor last Thursday, I asked her if it might be advantageous for us to treat my anxiety as well, as the nurse practitioner had told me that treating both had really turned some of her patients lives around drastically. I told her that Lexapro had been the only antidepressant that had really helped my dad, as he had tried most all of them. She put me on 10 mg of escitalopram daily, and 0.5 mg of lorazepam, both to be taken at night.

When I got home and looked up the drugs on drugs.com to read more about them, I was frightened to read the following:

> MAJOR DRUG INTERACTION!
> Talk to your doctor before using escitalopram together with lisdexamfetamine. Escitalopram may increase the effects of lisdexamfetamine, and side effects such as jitteriness, nervousness, anxiety, restlessness, and racing thoughts have been reported. Combining these medications can also increase the risk of a rare but serious condition called the serotonin syndrome, which may include symptoms such as confusion, hallucination, seizure, extreme changes in blood pressure, increased heart rate, fever, excessive sweating, shivering or shaking, blurred vision, muscle spasm or stiffness, tremor, incoordination, stomach cramp, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Severe cases may result in coma and even death. You should contact your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms while taking the medications. It is important to tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop using any medications without first talking to your doctor.

I called my doc to make sure I wouldn't fall over dead at any moment, and she assured me that such a warning will always pop up when taking Vyvanse and Lexapro together as a risk for seratonin syndrome, but to continue taking both as directed.

I figured both her and the pharmacist (I trust them both) wouldn't try to kill me, but I can usually find some research that puts me at ease. My first five days on the Lexapro have been miserable. I feel cloudy, like the Vyvanse isn't working anymore for concentration, ill at ease, had symptoms of diarreah (could just be stomach bug, it's that time of year, but it is listed as a symptom of SS), dilated pupils (bigger than normal), lethargy (I've slept most all weekend, but last night was in and out for most of the evening), and general stomach upset.

Friends have told me that their first couple weeks on antidepressants saw similar symptoms, but around a week and a half, it started to change their lives for the better. I had a similar experience on Zoloft when I tried it in late 2012, but as I was prescribed it during finals week, I really couldn't handle the cloudiness and headaches, and never refilled my script. This time, I really want to give the antidepressant an honest 8-week shot.

I'm still holding out hope for both, as just treating the ADHD alone has led me to concentrate well on things, but I'm still not able to let them go because of my anxiety – I just overdo them.

My questions are:

1. Do these Lexapro initial side-effects usually go away after a while?

2. Why is my doc not concerned about me developing serotonin symptom, when drugs.com scares the bejesus out of me for taking these two drugs together? Is it common to take these together? Is serotonin symptom exceedingly rare? (a.k.a. – is this the anxiety of a hypochondriac typing this?)

"Hi,

Just to introduce myself, I am a 30 y/o, 6 feet tall, about 175 male and am fairly healthy. I'm by no means in crazy good shape, but I do exercise quite regularly and eat fairly healthy.

I have worked as a tax accountant, and for about 5 years, I have on and off taken vyvanse. In that 5 years, I did not increase the dosage at all. It was always the same 40mg of XR. I was always able to take some time off of it during busy season, and the breaks always seemed to help. I would sometimes take a little extra during tax season, but never more than what had already been prescribed to me (extra from days of not taking it).

I took a few months off work, and therefore was not on medications (not abnormal for me), and I started working back in February. It has been an astounding difference in how much more is required to have any effect on me. I also used to be able to wake up super early and knock out work all day. Now, I get to work later, and am absolutely mentally dead by 1pm. I don't get it. Almost everyday after lunch, I'm messaging my friends and telling them I'm hitting my afternoon crash and that I just feel like crap. Believe me, I've tried eating incredibly healthy and exercising more frequently to see the effects.

I do not think there is any change in my job satisfaction. I also don't think there have been any crazy changes in my lifestyle or dietary habits.

The comedowns (even on a low dose) have gotten almost intolerable. If I do not take any type of benzo, I would/will usually go completely without sleep with awful anxiousness. Before, I would take about .5mg of clonzepam once or twice a month. It just was not necessary. The comedowns weren't nearly as awful.

I feel as though this has come out of nowhere. I always felt I was always extremely conscious of my stimulant intake. I have tried several other alternatives, but none work the way vyvanse does for me (when it's working correctly). Even Aderall IR gives me severe insomnia and anxiety.

I'm at a loss for my body's sudden change in its reaction to it. Even when I take weekends off of it, re-introducing it to my body on Monday has become a task.

Has anyone experienced such a sudden and dramatic change to their body's reaction? This has not been a slow and steady change for me.

I also have terrible blood flow to my hands and feet. sometimes it gets so bad that after my matches my hands and feet are turning purple. This has never happened before i started taking vyvanse.

"Hi,

My son is 16.  He is 5'8"", around 140 lbs.  White, in the U.S. (Ohio).  He has been on 50 mg of Vyvanse for years for ADHD, and 4 mg of Intuniv.  He also has spastic diplegic cerebral palsy.  Often, over the course of his life, he is prescribed a new medication that, when we research them, indicates a possibility of a serotonin syndrome reaction with the Vyvanse.  For example, cyclobenzaprine for muscle spasms.  Most recently, because of substantial chronic knee pain, he has been prescribed Cymbalta 30 mg.  He occasionally experiences symptoms consistent with mild serotonin syndrome:  headache, rapid heartbeat, raised temperature, nausea, agitation, confusion.  With the CP, he obviously experiences tight muscles and tremors continuously.        These symptoms are troubling for him, and on days when they are worse, we worry that it may be serotonin syndrome.  This is a pretty disheartening worry, but every time we bring it up with his prescribers, they hand wave, saying that serotonin syndrome is ""rare"", so we have nothing to worry about.  It seems to me that sure, it's nothing to worry about until you are one of the 200,000 annual people in the US that are diagnosed with and have to suffer through it.  To say nothing of those who have it but are not diagnosed.  

So my question is two-fold:  is there some kind of a gold standard group of symptoms that raise the flag for serotonin syndrome, above the level of just normal occasional side effects or personal daily idiosyncrasy?  I don't want to worry when I don't need to, and I don't want to take him off medications that he needs because of irrational fear.  At the same time, I don't want to ignore a serious trend of symptoms and have an emergency admission because everybody poo-poos the symptoms just because the syndrome is ""rare"".  I want to make sure I don't mistake the zebra for a horse.  And I don't want to spend anymore sleepless nights wondering if he will start exhibiting the more serious symptoms, like seizures and unconsciousness, during the night when there is nobody around to notice, and we find him dead in the morning.  There is very little info online about the progression of the syndrome, so this may sound hysterical, but this is what goes through my mind when I can't get practitioners to discuss the situation with me.

&#x200B;

Second, why is it so hard for our physicians to address the risks in a scientific, information-giving way?  Why am I treated like an over-wrought worrywort for raising issues that every responsible institutional website indicates is a consideration?  I am picturing a responsible medical response as, ""this is a concern with these classes of medication, but here is why I believe the dosages and situation make this ok for your son.  (Evidence based information follows).  If you think you are seeing these specific symptoms, it indicates there really is something to worry about, and you should (call our office, go to urgent care, go to emergency).""  I don't think the responsible answer to someone simply asking about serotonin syndrome is just a flat, ""Oh, that's really rare,""  or ""well, it's a risk acceptable to treat the pain"".  It does not provide me the information I need as a health care consumer to understand my son's symptoms and treatments.  And it makes me feel that the background thinking of the caregiver is ""This person is a hysterical Dr. Google who will grab anything I say acknowledging the syndrome is an issue and run with it, without capacity to listen to the nuances of the medical situation.  The less I acknowledge the better.""  Patients should not be treated like nervous nellies just because they ask reasonable questions.  I realize this second part is not a real question, but more of a rant.  I would, however, appreciate any thoughtful responses, because this is a frustrating issue that spans more than just serotonin syndrome, but other nuances of my experience with medical providers, and I would like some honest perspective from practitioners.",1,"se, headache, rapid heartbeat, raised temperature, nausea, agitation, confusion, tight muscles, tremors, seizure"

* Migraines since I was 4 or so - been on a wide variety of meds and they either didn't help or had side effects that weren't worth it for me
* Diagnosed with depression/anxiety around 20 - tried several different medications and eventually landed on Welbutrin, 300 mg daily
* Diagnosed with PCOS/infertility at 25

Backstory:
After years on Welbutrin, I noticed that I was angry all the time for little to no reason, so I went to a new psychiatrist to see if we could figure out why. Turns out that's a known impact of Welbutrin on some people. So he switched me to Cymbalta, 60 mg daily, and it has been AMAZING. However, since switching, I have gained 15 pounds, taking me from 145 to 160. I saw the psychiatrist again yesterday and after asking me the following two questions, he prescribed my Vyvanse.

* Do you ever eat a lot in one sitting and then feel bad about it?
* Do you find yourself eating when you're not hungry, but feel unable to stop?

I answered yes to both of those, and he said he wasn't making an official diagnosis, but I might have Binge Eating Disorder. Truthfully, I think I just love carbs and am possibly even addicted to food. I don't believe I have BED.

Questions:

1. Are there any issues I should be concerned about with Vyvanse? Side effects? Impacts on the effectiveness of the Cymbalta?
2. If I don't have BED (which I honestly don't think I do) and I don't have ADHD, is it bad to take Vyvanse? I'm mostly interested in it for its appetite suppressant qualities...
3. I have seen a few things about Vyvanse causing migraines. Is this something I should be concerned about given my history of chronic migraines?",1,

"Update: Nicotine was only helpful to me while I was still on Vyvanse and in withdrawal after stopping Vyvanse and stopping trazadone (an anticholinergic). Most of my symptoms have decreased significantly (although not completely, I’m not numb anymore but still sleepy and not completely functional a lot) and so nicotine is now barely beneficial for me. So I know most of you did not actually care whether or not my symptoms improved or if my suffering decreased and solely cared about me not doing nicotine, so you will be happy to know that I no longer have a reason to do nicotine and won’t. 
For people who are also on Vyvanse, I found out from Dr. Russell Barkley that it can suppress the limbic system and therefore your emotions over time. 

READ BEFORE COMMENTING: Can smokers please stop commenting about how I shouldn’t do nicotine because they regret smoking? Smoking tobacco and having a nicotine lozenge are different things. And I am really disappointed that I’ve gotten so many comments and the vast majority of them are so unhelpful and just telling me “don’t do it” and not offering me some alternative when I just told you I was suffering emotionally and suffering in my school work for 1.5 months and was completely numb. I’m literally failing almost every single class just because of the lack of work I was able to get through in the last 2 weeks, which will cost me like $20k. So please do not project onto me your smoker’s guilt, I posted on here to find out if there was an alternative I should look into. It doesn’t even seem like most of you have bothered to read my description.



So this is a very odd situation.
I’ve been doing pretty poorly in school during quarantine. I’ve been feeling very numb and unmotivated. I was on 20 mg in Vyvanse and then 40 mg of Vyvanse. On 20 mg I realized I wasn’t getting the focus benefits of Vyvanse. On 40 mg I was getting the focus benefits to some extent, but the come down was really hard and even thought it helped me focus, there was something about it that made me feel mentally slower. No matter what dosage of Vyvanse I was on, I felt really numb and unmotivated inside and it prevented me from being productive. It didn’t matter how much coffee or how much Vyvanse I had, it was like my body just stopped reacting to adrenaline. This has happened to me in past semesters as well, so it’s not just a quarantine thing. This even happened to me last semester while I was on 15 mg of lexapro.

I heard nicotine worked on acetylcholine receptors and my friend talked a lot about how much she loved nicotine. I decided I had nothing left to lose with how numb I felt inside and how poorly I was doing in school, so I bought 2 mg of nicotine lozenges. I sucked on half of it and took it out while I was trying to work at my friends place. I was also on 20 mg of Vyvanse at the time, but it was about 8 pm so it was close to the end of the duration.

And all of a sudden, I felt joy again. After a month of numbness and feeling like I was being dragged through the rest of the semester and barely eating because I was so bored of the idea of making another decision about what to eat. And it was such a relief, because I didn’t know when I was ever going to stop feeling numb again and I felt like I was barely a human and suddenly it was like I could breathe. My thoughts were finally moving at a normal speed. I felt motivation and I wanted to do my work and I did. 

And I don’t know what to do with that information. I don’t know if that means I should be trying out a certain type of antidepressant. I tried bupropion XL 150 mg for 1-2 months before and it made me had sporadic moments of hearing my pulse in my ear (but I had also just stopped using Vyvanse and I know Vyvanse had raised my blood pressure since I started using it). It had also made me a little irritated and I didn’t really see benefits from it. But maybe I didn’t give it enough time or didn’t use it a high enough dosage? 

Or I don’t know if I should start using nicotine gum medicinally 1-2 times a week. I know it has a high addiction rate and I don’t want it to downregulate any of my neurotransmitters. But it doesn’t have the same harms as smoking. But as far as I can tell, there really aren’t prescription drugs that work out there quite like nicotine. 

I just feel like now that I know that it’s possible for me to function like a normal and functioning person again, I need to try to figure out how to do it with a safer drug. 

I haven’t tried atomoxetine before, I don’t know if that’s something I should try

I was jolted awake this morning and sat straight up. The room was spinning and I actually thought I was dying. I've never passed out or fainted in my life, I felt like an animal that was shot down. The episode itself seemed to last about 30 seconds and I never lost full consciousness. 

I checked my Apple watch and my heart rate was 50 while I was asleep and shot up to 150. I'm not sure if the heart rate is what caused that episode or if that episode caused the high heart rate because I was so freaked out. 

I'm still pretty freaked out and remained on guard all day. I just had bloodwork and a physical literally a week ago, everything came back 100% fine except my iron panel came back with low ferritin (3ng/mL). But CBC, lipid panel, hormones, everything was perfect.

Anyone have any idea what this could have been? Can I chalk this up to vertigo? Any other signs to look out for? I'm genuinely afraid to sleep",1,

Starting in about middle school I would ""pass out"" randomly sometimes. I put pass out in quotation marks because often times I would still have consciousness, but I couldn't speak or see. Sometimes I would break out in sweats and feel very noxious. I would usually be able to call out and lay down before falling over. My warning signs were a sound I would describe as being like a white noise machine, or insects rubbing their wings together. Doctor basically just said deal with it.

About 2 years ago this changed to a very specific situation. It didn't happen very often, but when I turn my head to the right side (as in ear to shoulder), my left arm would go numb and I would lose vision in one or both eyes. If I turned my head to the left side my right arm would go numb without loss of vision.


Now fast forward to 2018 and this happens every single day. Except it's worse. I often have very little to no warning when I pass out. I had to skip this semester of college because I had two major falls, one caused me to get a concussion and fractured nose as well as major bruises, one just caused major bruises. My neck also feels constantly stiff, so when I stretch it my eyesight blackouts as well. I spent a few days in the hospital where they tested me for a bunch of things. Here were the results:


-a ct with contrast ink: Normal

-Chest xray: normal

-Right Arterial Duplex Ultrasound: now this is where it gets a bit weird: ""Very little to no flow in the right subclavian artery while the patient tilts her head to the right, highly suggesting thoracic outlet obstruction.""


So I thought they found it but then they repeated that test:
Cerebrovascular Duplex - Complete/Bilateral Ultrasound: No evidence of significant arterial occlusive disease in the common, internal,
and external carotid arteries bilaterally.


Normal flow in the right subclavian artery with and without provocative
maneuvers.


Antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries with no hemodynamically significant
change in flow patterns with provocative maneuvers bilaterally.


The provocative maneuvers used during this exam were the traditional turning of
 the head to both sides in addition to using the same neck and head position
that clinically causes the patient to have her symptoms.


It's important to note that in the first test that found the abnormality I started losing vision. In the second one I did not.


So after that they told me that most young girls pass out when they turn their head to the side and discharged me. I am going to still try and figure out whats wrong because I don't believe them. I was hoping that maybe some of you could point me in the right direction o what it might be so I can figure out what tests I should try to get.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who helped me out. For the first time in a while I feel validated and like there may actually be a solution. I'm making a document of everything you guys suggested and giving it to my pediatrician in hopes she will give me referrals. Thanks again!",1,"antegrade, losing vision"
"I'm a 27 year old 6'2"", 215lb canadian male who was recently diagnosed ADHD just before I turned 27 after my psych gave me a ADHD questionare and with that determined I was ADHD. Who knew I had been living with it my whole life and I'm just finding out now! Either way he prescribed me 40mg Vyvanse a month before I started a college course. I didn't real notice much so he doubled it to 80mg after the first month. I noticed the difference immediately; a little hyper when it first kicks in but way more focused on things throughout the day that I was doing or talking about,,more socially involved in conversing,my memory seemed better and for the first time in my life was earning high nineties in school. I felt like a new and improved person The downfall was that if I didn't take it first thing in the morning (between 7-9am)and took it closer to the afternoon (10 or later)come bedtime (11:30-12pm) I would get in bed but feel wide awake and pretty much be awake the whole night. I also noticed I'm kind of twitchy now with my fingers or tapping them or bein fidgety and not even notice myself doing that (except when trying to sleep I catch myself doing it all the time before I actually am sleepin). So to elaborate on my question is insomnia or my busy hands a side effect or does it mean I'm on too much? Lastly, I don't want to sound stupid but can Vyvanse cause you to be TOO (overly) focused on things?

I’ve seen people say that increasing doses has had this negative effect and they went back down to their original dose. However, yesterday I felt completely different than i do today. Is it likely that this feeling will go away after about a week on it/ after the headache goes away?",1,
"My doctor just prescribed me Concerta for my ADD. In the past I have taken Adderall, Vyvanse, and Strattera. 

I'm just wondering how these compare to any of those, and what I have to expect. Adderall seemed to work best out of these, however was extremely addicting and its effects diminished after only a couple weeks of use. Vyvanse was too mild; I didn't really feel it work well enough. And Strattera (which is not even a stimulant) just sent me deeper into depression.

"I have ADHD and have tried Straterra, Wellbutrin, Vyvanse. My pdoc prescribed me Concerta, which I will be taking tomorrow. What can I expect on this drug? Has it helped any of you with ADHD? or with studying? What I would most like to know is how does it compare with Adderall?",1,
"I don't have ADD or ADHD (to my knowledge). I once took 80mg of Vyvanse to study for school and it made me sleepy, it didn't really help me focus at all but I did crash really hard the next day. 

A different time I took 54mg of Concerta and it also made me sleepy and didn't help me focus. 

I also have depression and anxiety. I get prescribed Wellbutrin and Xanax but I don't take them as regularly as I should and hadn't taken them either of the times I took Vyvanse or Concerta. 

What could be the problem here?",1,sleepy

"Firstly, I just want to clear up that I have had medical advice regarding stopping medication from my psychiatrist, and I'm checking back with him regularly to chart progress.   
  
For about 3 years now, I've been reliant on a cocktail of psychiatric medication to help me, but they only seemed to numb me further, and kept me from feeling anything, I feel like I should really do something to overcome it, and try to fight this without the medication.   
  
I suffer from Depression, anxiety, paranoia and a form of psychosomatic pain disorder. I originally went to my doctors for help with the pain and depression, the anxiety and paranoia seemed to have rooted from the medication to be honest.   
  
Every day I take; 36mg Concerta XL, 2.5mg Risperidal, 25mg fluoxitine and 20mg Melatonin. I hardly feel human anymore, no control over my emotions at all, hence why I want to stop.   
  
I'm just really scared of relapsing, or not realising how much I am dependant on medication. I've organised my summer holidays to include plenty of physical activity, exercise, improving my sleep patterns, and trying to overcome the anxiety, depression and paranoia. I'm just scared of failing, I'm really tired of trying to be honest, it just feels like an all-or-nothing attempt.   
  
I'm really sorry if this doesn't make much sense, it does feel like an incoherent ramble, but it's 2:00 a.m. and just another sleepless night, I feel it's now or never to overcome my dependency on medication, I don't want to be stuck in that intermediate state of feeling empty and worthless.   
  
Has anyone had any experience with anything similar, or just any words of advice, or anything?  
  
I'm 18 in a few days, and feel like I really should get my shit together now, and I don't have any other sources of advice.

"I've been using Adderall relatively infrequently to help with my studies for the past 2 years, and while it makes a world of difference, I can never fall asleep at night regardless of what time I took it.  Perfect example: yesterday I took 1 30mg XR at 1:00 PM, waited for it to kick in, and studied until about 1 or 2 AM when I finally felt confident that I was prepared for my exam.  Now, it's 9:25, I still haven't fallen asleep yet, and my exam is in 40 minutes.  Is there some kind of secret as to how to avoid this that doesn't involve not doing it? 

TL;DR: Adderall helps me a lot with schoolwork, but it makes me an insomniac.  Is there a secret that could help me sleep?",1,
"I have ADHD-PI and SCT, and it is seriously the bane of my existence. Throughout middle school, my parents and teachers had me convinced that I'm just incompetent and lazy, and all I need to do is get my act together. I was diagnosed back in June, and started feeling a bit better knowing I was getting help. I've been on Concerta since then, which hasn't made any difference whatsoever, and my doctor isn't letting me switch to Adderall just yet.

2 weeks into my sophomore year of high school, I've already dug myself into a hole that I'm going to have a hell of a time getting out of. Now I'm back in the mindset that I just need to try harder, even though I don't think that's possible. I feel like absolute shit. I'm smart (or so people keep telling me), but I can't take advantage of that because my brain can't fucking function properly. I let down people who invested hope in me, and I wear out anyone who tries to help. I don't know how I could possibly do the things I want to do and be successful in life if I can't do something seemingly simple without someone walking me through the steps like I'm retarded. I feel helpless and alone, and have basically given up hope. Is there any way I can just snap out of it and just be content for once?

"I was diagnosed with ADD when I was around 5 or 6, and have been off or on different medications since (I am now 19), recently I moved out from home for school and the doctor at the school clinic (I had some unrelated issues I had to go see them for) referenced back to some of my records about the doctors mentioning autism more than a few times. I asked my parents and they said that doctors did mention it but put me on Ritalin (now Concerta) saying that it was probably just ADD. Who should I talk to, to get this sorted out? My family doctor is 4 hours drive from here and I can't afford to take time out of work / school to be able to set aside the time to go down home.

"I am 19 years old. I have recently started taking Prozaic for anxiety. I also take Strattera and Concerta each morning along with it (for ADD). Anyway, it seems like this feeling started around the time I started taking Prozaic (about 2 weeks ago) and has gotten more noticeable.

I constantly have this 'sensation' in my lowest stomach area + penis that almost feels orgasmic, but not as strong. I do not mean orgasmic, as in pleasurable, because it is persistent and uncomfortable to feel this with everything I do throughout the day. It almost feels like my stomach is a little weak and somewhat contracting when I feel this. I have tried masturbating, which felt just as good if not better than normal, but it didn't end up helping (it didn't make the feeling any less noticeable even immediately after masturbating).

I have been searching online for a long time tonight to no avail. No one else seems to have ever had this problem before based on my searches (although I'm sure people have).

PLEASE, if you have any advice or know anything about this (or what I should do to get it taken care of), let me know. I'm going to try to go to bed now, if I can sleep, and will check in the morning for any answers :(

Thanks a lot, everyone.

"So, everything started around early to mid September of 2007. I always felt like someone had their finger down my throat and I was about to gag, no matter where I was or what I was doing(I first felt this in 2002-2003, but it was only that year). I was also having frequent panic attacks, but I didn't know what they were at the time. 

2007 was the year I started 8th grade, and it came on pretty much at the start. I missed a couple weeks of school, and I saw a couple doctors, but no one really could understand what I was trying to get across. Eighth grade went alright, and I didn't miss much school after the initial bit at the beginning, but I still always felt like I was going to gag. This is also when I found out that it's difficult for me to eat around people, or be around people when they are eating. 

During 9th grade I functioned better. I didn't miss any school, had a girlfriend, but I still always felt anxious and about to gag, and at this point I was getting pretty skinny from eating about 1 meal per day. My parents, her, and I, took a week trip to San Francisco, 12 hours drive south of me, and I just couldn't eat anything the entire time. 

The first couple months of 10th grade were pretty bad again. I missed a lot of school, I was getting depressed, and my girlfriend broke up with me because I never felt like doing anything. I switched some of my classes around so I would know more people in them, and so I didn't have such a heavy load from all the AP classes, but I still couldn't do it. I gradually went to school less and less, and by the end of November, I wasn't going at all. November 26, 2009, Thanksgiving, was the first time I tried to kill myself. I just didn't want to live any longer, I didn't see any hope. I was taken to the hospital, but I was only there for a couple hours and then I returned home, where I was then under constant watch by my parents, and all my things were moved into the living room. I don't remember exactly when, but at some point during the year I tried to lift my chair, and I threw my back out, and I could hardly move for the better part of a week. On top of that, I was in the restroom one night, I had gotten up from sleeping, and while I was using it, I collapsed and my lower back landed right on the rim of the bathtub, and I was in the until my dad came and pulled me out. I collapsed again right after. The doctor I was seeing at the time somehow had convinced me to try going to school again, so I went for half days, and had a classes with someone I knew all day. I still just did not feel like going, or was overwhelmed with anxiety, and I officially dropped out for the year. I spent my free time on World of Warcraft, trying to keep my mind off of my real life, because I hated it. When I dropped out, my mother applied me to a smaller school that is ranked in the top 5 high schools in the country, and I told my mother that I would not go there. 

Well, we got a call one Thursday night, school started the following Monday, saying that I had been accepted. I told them I wasn't going to go, and they threatened kicking me out of the house. I ended up going, reluctantly, and it was basically the same thing that happened the previous year. I missed some days, but I went for the most part. I really missed my girlfriend, and I found out that she had started being with someone that I had a personal history with, and I just couldn't stand it. I tried killing myself again that fall, and my mother took me to see my doctor, and he admitted me to the child psychiatric ward for being suicidal and anorexic(he didn't understand why I couldn't eat). I spent a week there, not eating, and being tested and all that. I didn't enjoy it much. After I was out, they told me to go see a doctor that they recommended, and I did see him for a while. He probably came the closest to understanding how I felt, but in March he moved away for a better job offer. I dropped out of school again, around February, because I just couldn't handle all the pressure and it was too difficult to attend. 

My mother took me to the community college to sign up for a GED class, and I did. This past summer, I got a call telling me that I had gotten in, and that I was to be there one the date and time it began. I went, but I really did not want to. My high school required me to attend 12 hours of class time before they would pay the expenses for me to take the official test. I went for 2 weeks, and then I was pretty much done. I just had to wait for the paperwork to go through, and then it was a matter of getting myself to go and take the test. It took me a couple weeks to work myself up to do it, and I ended up taking it on the last day of the term that it was available. I passed it without problem, I knew I would though. During 10th grade take 2, I had taken the PSATs and scored in the 99th percentile or something. 

So now, I spend all my time in my room at the computer, afraid to do much else, and my parents are starting to push me on what I'm going to do next. They want me to get a job, but I just can't. I want to, so badly, so get out of the house, maybe get back in shape a little, and to have my own money. I can't psych myself up enough to go anywhere and apply, so here I am, wondering what is next.

During these 4 years, I've seen at least 13 different doctors or psychiatrists/psychologists, and been on Lexapro, Pristiq, Wellbutrin, Prozac, Celexa, Effexor, Clonipin, Ativan, Concerta, Nuvigil, and probably some more that I can't think of right now. 

I've been diagnosed with severe anxiety, panic disorder with agoraphobia and emetophobia, avoidant personality disorder, scoliosis, some depression(which I think was partly a result of the anxiety), and a communication disorder where I don't pick up on subtle hints in a conversation, or know how people feel just by something they say, unless they come out and say for they feel. I always feel so awkward talking to anyone. 

I don't know where to go from here or what to do,  I really need some help. 

If anyone needs anything clarified some more, I would be more than glad to, just ask. 

Edit to add: I'm currently 17, and I turn 18 in January. 

Edit #2: I forgot to say that I'm currently on 80mg of Prozac every morning.

"What's up reddit, I need to call upon your collective wisdom. Let me lay it down for you. So I've been ADD ever since I was kid- not hyperactive, just extremely unfocused with a very short attention span. It's always made school difficult for me, and even though I have pretty high intelligence, my grades suck because of lack of motivation and organizational skills. Add on top of that I'm always tired, and constantly feel the urge to sleep, which doesn't help me get much done. In fact, this is probably the most detrimental of my problems. Because I'm CONSTANTLY tired, like always, no matter how much or how little sleep I get, and dammit, the need to sleep is a powerful thing. Still no idea what the cause for that is- I've gotten treatment for depression, tried spending more time socializing, even tried those sunlamp things- now I'm just more tired from all the therapy and hanging out. In high school I went on Adderall, which was my magic bullet for a while- til I started using it to get high. I lost a dangerous amount of weight, started experiencing irregular heartbeat, and finally started experiencing delusions. Scared crapless, I quit cold turkey. Once again my grades suck, I barely graduate, and flunk out of college. I took a year off to work full time and have decided to give school another go, so I enroll in community college with the intent to transfer. A couple semesters later, I'm passing by the skin of my teeth and it's getting closer to go time with the whole transfer thing. With widespread use of stimulants of college campuses, competition is so stiff that at this point I don't even know what my chances for transferring into university are, and the thought of what is going to be required of me to graduate, get into grad school, and graduate from there is looking pretty impossible. This semester was the toughest yet and I'm back on the A train. And let me explain, it's not just school thats the problem- my lack of focus and energy affects my social life, my ability to work, drive, maintain a home, etc, and this shit just makes it all way easier. But I can feel the physical affects getting to me and its clear I can't be doing this much longer. So what are my options? Anybody tried non stimulant meds for ADD with any success? Or should I kick the meds altogether and try some kind of lifestyle change? More importantly, is it even worth it to keep trying to go the academic route or should I just cut my losses and find some kind of trade I can work in? It's a shame because I really do love learning and academic pursuits, I'm just a shitty student. But I have to make a choice soon. Any advice, personal experiences, motivational stories?",1,"heartbeat, ##usions"

In highschool I was on ADHD medication, Concerta, and before that Ritilin. Our senior projects were coming fast and I was struggling to get everything done, at the time I lived with my girlfriend at her place. In between school, work, and taking care of the house I had little time to get my actual school work done. A friend of mine gave me some Adderall and told me it was the same as ADHD medication, that it would help me focus. So for about four weeks I would take two 30mg Adderall and make them last all day. The fourth week I realized that was having to take more than usual to get the same results, and not long after that I realized that my body had become used to the drug and I couldn't function without it. I started my cleansing by taking lower doses each day until I stopped all together. My story is one of many events, but it was scary for me at the time. ",1,
"I had ""ADD"" when I was a child/teenager, but it wasnt sever enough for treatment with drugs.

"So I’ve been taking Mirtazapine for the last few days, and the level of fatigue I’ve felt is extreme to say the least and I was wondering if anyone else has had this issue. Before anyone asks, yes I have contacted my provider at this point and I had labs done prior to starting it, everything is normal there. I’ve been taking Mirtazapine at 7.5 mg for the last few days, and the side effects have been pretty extreme. I knew drowsiness is a common side effect, so I was prepared for it and have only taken it before bed, making sure I have 12 hours before my next shift at work so the worst of it would be slept through. But it’s much worse than I expected, to the point it’s actually been negatively impacting my life. I feel like my body is made of lead, I’m struggling to do basic functions like writing and at times I’m worried I’m going to collapse because my body feels so heavy. I’m not able to focus on anything, which is especially bad since I work graves at a psych facility and I need to be aware while at work. I’ve had multiple coworkers and managers ask me if I was ok, because apparently I look awful and they’re concerned which means I’ve had to inform them that I’m taking antidepressants in the first place which I didn’t exactly want to advertise. The night nurse pulled me aside and actually did a check up, which is how I’ve found out I currently have a fever as well, which has made things worse, and she’s suggested I stop taking the medication and reach out to my doctor, which I’m considering at this point. This has also started affecting my college work as well, because I was completely unconscious from 9am on Saturday until 1040pm on Sunday, during which I missed an exam that is worth a large portion of my grade that I don’t think the professor will let me retake since he’s very strict with time management. This also made me late for work, since I work up an hour after my shift started. I thought the drowsiness wouldn’t be an issue since I also take two separate simulates (Concerta ER 36mg and Modafinil 100mg) as I do have pretty severe ADHD and idiopathic hypersomnia so I thought they would balance things out well, but it’s not had any effect at all. The fatigue is bad enough that the first day I took it I spent 2 hours in bed trying to get my body to move. Is this level of fatigue normal? If I stop taking the medication, how long will it take for me to get back to normal. If anyone else has had issues like this or have an advice, I’d appreciate it.

"I have been on this medication for ADHD for probably 5 years total. I’m just wondering why sometimes it seems perfect and then sometimes it makes a person feel like garbage (tired and depressed)? And I don’t mean later at the “comedown”, I mean shortly after taking the medication.

Background: I have tried methylphenidate —- I was on the short release form for probably 2-3 years, and it seemed to kind of work at the beginning and then for moving forward for some time.. at least, what I mean is, it worked for providing some focus to me for a couple hours in the day.(The long-acting forms, i.e. Concerta and biphentin did not work for me for some reason!). But, then I realized I needed something longer-acting for my lifestyle.. (but it also started making me lethargic somehow, or doing the opposite that it was supposed to!)…

I had also tried Adderall XR —— I think I was on it for roughly a year or a little less (many years ago), but it actually did absolutely nothing good for me at all, and then my P-doc at the time did not let me change back to something else! I had since moved on to a new p-doc, and that’s when I got put on the methylphenidate, and now I’m back on Vyvanse (since methylphenidate seemed to stop working, and I needed something longer-acting anyway!).

I just want the treatment to work for moving forward, consistently, just for once…? :(",1,lethargic
"For slight context, I recieved an adult Autism diagnosis. Prior, I'd started writing a memoir and at this point I'm exploring the first medication I was prescribed. At this point in grade 11, I'd had a previous diagnosis of 'mild ADD tendencies'. They prescribed me Concerta which saw me tearing up the living room after having watched Gran Torino for the first time. I see that it is classified as a ""stimulant"". 

Do I just have a narrow and limited view of what a stimulant is? Because I see that it's often prescribed for ADHD, but my logical brain isn't sure why you'd prescribe something labelled a stimulant to someone who's been consistently overstimulated by the world and life. Thus, I must be missing something. Caffeine for instance is considered a stimulant and I wouldn't prescribe that to someone jumping off the walls 🤔",1,
"As the title says, my old psychiatrist diagnosed me with ADHD after 20 minutes of seeing me. I was prescribed with concerta, which worked for a while (improved my ability to concentrate), until it didn't, my psychiatrist increased my dosage, but it stopped working after a while, he prescribed me Adderall and upped my dosage, because similarly to concerta, it didn't work as much anymore. When I was being medicated, I was very anxious, fidgety, unhappy, on-edge, etc... I feel like I don't remember much about that period, because I felt like a robot, I was also quite short-tempered and a bit mean. However, the noises in my head were no longer that loud, and I was able to do really well at work because I was finally able to concentrate. I decided to see another Psychiatrist because the first one was kind of an asshole and I didn't trust him at all. My new psychiatrist told me it's probably not ADHD, and that I seem to have symptoms of bipolarity. She didn't give me any medicine, even after meeting her multiple times, and told me to track my moods to see where I fall on the bipolarity spectrum. I do agree with her that I show signs of Bipolarity, and I know that some ADHD symptoms overlap with bipolar, but I'm not 100% convinced. I also asked her if I might have the 2 but she doubts that.

My question is: if I was being wrongfully medicated for about a year, how was I able to live a somewhat ""normal"" life for that duration? Also, how was I able to cut it off entirely all at once with no signs of withdrawal at all?",1,

"nausea after eating on adhd meds?

i wonder if the following is normal/ would like to hear experiences on this:

eating with concerta (or other adhd medication).

whenever i take concerta (18mg) i feel hungry and like i should eat something, but whenever i eat something i feel nauseous.
i used to love to eat and sometimes i ate too much.
now i still eat but somehow i have an aversion to food. nothing tastes good to me anymore.

especially the nausea afterwards annoys me...
does anyone know this?

all food is now boring, gives me nausea or disgusts me....
things i liked to eat are now disgusting.
the nausea always occurs after eating.


experience reports or tipps wanted!",1,"nausea, nausea"
"Hello! I have been taking adderal for the last couple years. It really was a great medication. It helped with my depression,my anxiety, and with paying attention. I recently quit taking it because I moved and I can't find a doctor to prescribe it. It's controversial because it's addictivr. My current doctor is only open to non narcotic stuff.

Right now I'm taking Wellbutrin 100mg, Gabapentin 100mg, and Depakote. I'm feeling good. But it's not enough. I feel not even close to what I feel on adderal but I DID do a music project today. Music projects are very tedious and I absolutely never am interested in them unless I use stimulants. I want that spark that I get with adderal but I want to find an alternative. 

My doctor is open to possibly adding cymbalta in the future. I've taken that before and it's OK but the side effects outweighed the benefits. Bad sexual side effects. 

I was thinking Concerta maybe. It's a warm rush without the euphoria. It keeps me from being sleepy during the day. Or would he be open to vyvanse since it isn't quick release or will he deny it since it's still a stimulant? I'm trying to be reasonable but they are all very stern here in California about any sort of addictive medication. I'm hoping he will meet me in the middle eventually because I really just want to help myself. Genuinely. Okay well comments are MUCH appreciated, thanks in advanced!!

"I am on 54mg Concerta for ADHD, and 200mg of Lamotrigine for bipolar 2. I recently started 150mg of Wellbutrin to help with my depression & I've heard of people having seizures on this medication so I'm a little worried...  

I know Lamotrigine can also prevent seizures and I've never had a seizure in the past, but I was just wondering what the chances are of me having a seizure...",1,"seizures, seizure, seizure"
"Background info: So, I'm an amphetamine user, and when I'm not using I tend to drink heavily. I managed 2 months strong sobriety, but I'm confident I use as a way to manage mental health. I discovered when I was 16 that I had ADD when Concerta simply made me feel normal rather than a party. Due to issues getting a prescription (history of abuse) and supply in the market I try to use methamphetamine for medicinal purposes but have gotten carried away before. I also suffer from trauma related to helicopter parenting, bipolar and due to psychosis induced by meth some time ago, that has bumped to bipolar schizoaffective.

Current issue: I noticed my usage getting a bit high and paranoia setting in, so I decided to quit using. I was also starting an SSRI at the time, and a plethora of life stresses as well as that cascaded into a suicidal episode followed by what appears to be psychosis. 
This is where it gets weird: upon inventory of meth usage and stoppage, the rarity of SSRIs to cause psychosis, and the fact this happened over a depressive episode don't classically add up to psychosis. I live with my parents, they are fundamental Christians and have little respect for psychology or science. My ""experiences"" don't extend outside the house. My ""delusion"" we'll call it, is that family and friends are upstairs (entering and exiting strategically to avoid being seen) and I'm being bombarded from a distance with messages across the house faint enough to hear, but also faint enough to be perceived as hallucination. The issue remains in that I hear my mom's voice responding to my actions and things I type in real time as if there's some kind of surveillance going on, obviously my phone would be suspect 1. Has anyone heard of some kind of misguided religious program that would encourage making me believe I'm losing my mind to discourage drug use? If ANYONE has heard of anything like this please let me know. I'm willing to accept this could be real delusion but after way too hard a crash going cold turkey I've managed 1-2 lines a day, which in my usage history is extremely mild. So, that should rule put both use induced and withdrawal induced psychosis. Plus the thing about it stopping when I leave the house.",1,##ychosis
"About two years ago, I was experiencing wild mood swings. I would go from depressed and unmotivated, to full of energy and drive, in the span of a couple hours. This happened at least twice a day. To me, these symptoms sounded like Bipolar Disorder (bear in mind I don’t have a psychology training, and was basically basing this initial “diagnosis” off pop culture.) As I did more research, I began to see more and more symptoms that fit how I was feeling. (Looking back, they were probably common symptoms of other disorders. And I was probably self-fulfilling some of the symptoms as well.) As I researched, I saw more and more symptoms that I “had.” So I took this list of symptoms to my psychiatrist and, after some further discussions where he asked more questions about the symptoms I had told him about, I was put on Lamictal.

Flash forward 2 years of taking a good-sized dosage every morning alongside Concerta for ADD, and Prozac. I start having really bad memory loss issues, outside the normal ADD symptoms of getting distracted. I began forgetting words, and things I had been told an hour earlier. So I slowly stopped taking Lamictal.

6 months later, I was hospitalized for homicidal and suicidal ideation. After the doctors determined I wasn’t an threat to myself or others, I was discharged, but put in an outpatient program for Adolescents with Mood Disorders. After speaking with the three doctors there, they determined that I didn’t have Bipolar Disorder, or Chronic Depression. Instead, they gave me the diagnosis of High Functioning Autism and Social Anxiety. The ADD diagnosis didn’t change. Needless to say, we didn’t go back to the first doctor 

The moral of the story: even if you haven’t “self-diagnosed,” and you’re going to a professional with a list of symptoms you’re concerned about, be careful. You may end up misdiagnosed, purely from an unconscious confirmation bias that means you only mention the symptoms that confirm what you’re thinking: 

TL;DR: I had some symptoms of Bipolar Disorder. I went to my psychiatrist with the symptoms, and he diagnosed me with BD. After 2 years of medication and memory loss, other doctors determine that I am not. ",1,
"On some antidepressants and concerta. 

I experience waves of excessive anger and it fucks up my muscles and gives me cramps(sort of?...) 

First time this started happening was when I quit Sertraline and now back on in but on a lower dose due to not being able to get a new prescription.

Now, what the fuck is this? I don’t think I’ve ever felt so angry before in my life that parts of my body started moving on their own. Does anyone have experience with this?",1,"excessive anger, up, muscles, cramps"
"I (M31) was diagnosed by psychologist with ADHD (anxiety & depression, but TBD if they're in addition to or stem from the ADHD) in June, and I finally made an appointment to see my GP to talk about next steps (I kept bailing on it; then the Dr. forgot to call me back after I had an initial appointment until I followed up...).Seeing a counsellor for anxiety already, and (before catching covid) I was exercising \~3-4 times a week.Called the nurse line and had a telehealth call with a MH focused GP (he echoed the psychologist's suggestion regarding medication, likely Concerta) to get more information how to go through the system.

I'm not gonna lie, I don't know why I am feeling so nervous / anxious about it. Not sure if it's the excitement or nervousness about talking about this with someone or what it is :/ Is this normal or am I just overthinking this?

I feel guilty that I need to vent / share when I see so many people hurting far more than me. Thanks for visiting. Stay strong. You can do this.

"I’ve been struggling with ADHD for all my life and just recently been diagnosed for it. I’m taking Concerta at the moment. I’ve really noticed things starting to come together; responsibility’s, tasks, remembering, and over thought processes. But one thing I’ve noticed that’s been deteriorating me for a while, is constant stress. I use to have OCD symptoms when I was younger and would also have anxiety. But growing up I seemed to have forget about my OCD and anxiety tendencies, as well as forgetting everything else. Was my ADHD blurring out my symptom’s of OCD and Anxiety?, and is taking medication finally bringing out those symptoms? I’ve felt the best I’ve ever felt but at the same time at one of the scariest mental health points in my life. I find my self constantly shaking and stressing out about nothing. Constantly worried about things I haven’t done. And always ending up crying and freaking out when I’m alone because of stress. I’m not going to seeing my doctor for a couple of weeks. is this possible?, do I have to be medicated for both? What do I do?",1,"##cd, ##cd, ocd"
"This past weekend has been hell for my family. My cousin (23m), whom I shall be calling F, has been acting real strange over the past 2 weeks, until his behaviour peaked with a deafening crescendo this past Sunday. This strange behaviour would include glimpses of incoherent dialogue, as well as fluctuating mood. F would wake up at 4:30 every morning and would start playing music very loudly in the lounge, often replaying songs when they're halfway through, sometimes 3 to 4 times in a row, and giddily laughing to himself at certain lyrics or sounds. This got exponentially worse as time went on. 

I wasn't present Friday evening, but apparently he had started acting aggressively towards his mother. He would become visibly angry at the most innocuous questions! His mother reported him becoming very difficult to reason with (well, more difficult than usual). Saturday, his parents were out most of the day, but I was there in my flat, and F and his brother were also home. That morning, F stood in front of the television and played songs for 5 seconds before skipping them *for 3 hours, without pause.* He would linger on some songs, but would skip them as soon as the intro transitions into the verse. The volume and bass grew to be unbearable for me after some time, so I went to him, and had to tap him on the shoulder to ask him to turn it down. He vacantly stared at me, after which turning it down by literally 1 decibel. I went to my room and turned my media up as loud as I could and just went about my business.

That evening, when his parents returned, F got into a huge argument with his father about the sports game that had occurred that day. F didn't even watch the game!! He went off on a diatribe about the team captain, criticizing their skin colour and on and on. His father eventually told him: ""Listen, I don't want to argue with you over dumb sh\*t."" This made F explode with rage. He started screaming at his parents, the contents of which were incoherent to me, since I only entered the room half-way through the diatribe. He threatened his father with violence, and then threatened us all with violence, before retreating to his room and shouting obscenities at God and at ""everybody"". My uncle came to me, and asked me to please speak some sense into him, because my uncle was getting extremely irate. I went into his room, to find him standing at the window, biting into his knuckle, teary eyed, gazing out of the window. I slowly approached him, placed my hand on his shoulder, and softly asked F to talk to me, to articulate his qualms to me. His gaze fell upon me, followed by a low mumbling: ""I'm gonna f\*cking kill you lot, I'll show you, I will show you all.""   
I asked him: ""What are you going to show us?"", but he only responded more aggressively and loudly with threats of violence. I walked out of there before I punched him, and went to talk to the family about the situation. F's mother blames his cannabis use and started hiding kitchen knives and house keys, and his father thinks it would be best to just leave him cooped up in his room, since rationality isn't really on the table right now. 

After a couple of hours (This is round about 23:00 in the evening), when everybody subsided to their rooms, F emerged from his. He entered the kitchen, cheerily talking to himself. The contents of his speech were barely audible to me from my room, but I could make out that he was having a dialogue. I first thought: ""Perhaps he is on the phone"". I curiously listened in on him, and came to the disturbing realization that: 1.) He is talking to himself, and 2.) he is talking absolute nonsense, going on about ""being 17000 years old"", and ""this life having run its course"", every now and then giving a cheery retort to the confused pets accompanying him.   
Right as I decided to go inspect the situation, F's brother came out to him and demanded that he go to sleep, since he is causing a severe disturbance. F kept saying: ""If I go to sleep, then I die. You will have to kill me to make me go to sleep."" I got very irritated with F, and I told him to stop thinking about himself, and show some respect to the rest of the inhabitants of the house. This was very wrong of me, because it set him off properly. He went on another diatribe about how ""Why the f\*ck should I show anybody any respect if I am not given any!? I don't need your respect nor your approval on anything... - - "", after which he flung his cup of coffee into the air, and stormed towards his room. I walked in front of him with a stoic face, and he proceeded to scream right in my face, while jumping up and down, demanding that I ""Kill him"", and ""punch him"". F's mother rushed into the kitchen to intervene. Upon seeing his mother, he pointed to her, and proclaimed: ""See? You wouldn't lay a finger on me, because if you do, then they will protect me."" 

F's brother deescalated the situation by instructing me to stop engaging with F, since he suspects that F is not aware of what he is saying nor doing. This realization struck me like a ton of bricks... I backed down, and started F down as he stood in the kitchen, flailing around, directing nasty retorts towards his mother, sprinkled with several layers of nonsense-talk in between. After about 20 minutes of this commotion, F's father entered the room and instructed the rest of us to refrain from engaging with F, since it seems as though our engagement only fuels his outbursts. Very sensible, I concurred. We once more retreated to our rooms, and allowed this catastrophic display to run its course. Every 5 minutes, F would pace to the front door, violently tug at the door handle, and then pace back to his room. This went on from 00:00 to 04:00. I only slept from 05:00 to 08:00, because the commotion was ceaseless. 

\- - -

When I arose, the peace and quiet finally graced me. I got up and welcomed it, rushing to the lounge where a furnace was churning merrily, and the morning breeze swept gracefully through the air, amid the smell of coffee and breakfast. I thought the ordeal had passed, but unfortunately it only got much **much** worse... F entered the lounge from the outside courtyard, and seemed calm. He greeted me with a smile, and went and stood before the furnace, warming his hands. I went and stood beside him, making oblivious banter. I quickly realized that he was still in this *state.* (I don't know how to describe it) He would momentarily slip between lucidity and insanity, his eyes widening and tearing up, but then dilating and showing glee. The family spent some time in the lounge, going about a Sunday morning as usual. I went to my room to conduct my usual Sunday business. After about 3 hours, my aunt entered my room and asked me to watch the food she is preparing, because she and my uncle were going out with F to the neighbour's house, who F has been insisting to speak with since last night. About what? God only knows. I agreed, and after 20 minutes, they returned - absent F. F remained at the neighbour's house, and was apparently in deep conversation with them. Some time passed, and F hasn't returned. We had lunch, and still: no F. We went out to go look for him, and that is when S hit the fan...

We drove with 2 cars, my uncle and my other cousin went on foot, and we scoured the neighbourhood searching for F. I eventually found him at the far end of the neighbourhood, apprehended by a private security van, and with people standing outside. I sped up and slid to a screeching halt beside them, to find F in a state of hysteria, shouting obscenities, alluding to some sort of divine task to save someone called ""Amy"". (We don't know of anybody in his named Amy. Might be some friend of his that we don't know about, Idk) I intervened, and told everybody present of the circumstances, and who I am. I established that he isn't under arrest, although he threatened the people living at that house with violence. I asked the security guard whether or not I could take F home and he agreed that it would be for the best. F flat out refused to get into my car. I insisted that he complies, and I started tugging him towards the car. When he physically resisted, I (VERY STUPIDLY, I KNOW) started shoving him towards my car, and tried to force him in. He slammed my car door shut and punched the window, but luckily it didn't break. A short scuffle ensued. I foolishly grabbed him by the throat and yelled at him to ""snap out of it"" and that he's ""p\*ssing away his life"" etc. etc. Again, he shouted at me asking me to kill him, to punch him. I backed right off and alerted the family to F's whereabouts. 

The police arrived, and loaded him into the back, after he physically resisted myself and my uncle to enter one of our cars. They took F to the hospital, where they had to sedate him and restrain him. He started flailing around, tearing off his clothes, and alluding to seeing ""dots and stars"" and all kinds of sh\*t.

The hospital notified us that he must remain there for 72 hours. Right now, we can only wait...

&#x200B;

Folks, I along with my family, are very concerned. I, personally, am scared of what he might do when he gets out... What on earth is going on here? We suspect it is a psychotic episode, possibly caused by his meds for depression(Concerta) mixed with his daily cannabis use. The Doc (who's 2 hours away) thinks it might be bipolar... I am open to any suggestions on how to handle this situation... What can we expect? How do we interact with him when he is in this state? WTF do we do now??

"Hello all.

I already always was desperate,  but now even more to post a topic about it here.

To keep my past short;

I was bullied all day in and out for like 10 years or so, so  I quit school when I was 16, then isolated myself in my room for years,  suffered severe depression. On my 22 year I moved on my own, stayed for around 1 year, then back to my parents because of loneliness and financial stress, then many times more forth and back with assisted living locations.

Anyway, ever since these years I always suffered from overthinking, rumilation, anxiety, depression, jealousy and distrust.

As the years went on ( I am almost 28 now ), I went to different mental health cares.

The first one diagnosed me with autism.
The second one years later undiagnosed me from Autism and diagnosed me with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder)

Now I recently am at a third one, and went for a probable ADD diagnose. The result; no ADD, and he thought it wasnt BPD either. He concluded that I have;

- Low information speed processing
- Sensitive to Stimulus

Over all these years I tried dozens of different medications, antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines... nothing ever worked.

I currently still use Escitalopram 10 MG (went from 15 long time ago), Depakine Chrono 3 x 300 mg, Lorazepam 1 mg (went from 3 x 1 mg to 1 x 1 mg ), still helps me to calm down somewhat.

And since recently because of my symptoms, I was prescribed Ritalin to try. 5 mg did nothing, 10 mg did something for short but felt terrible,  15 mg I felt great, 20 mg was too much. Now I have been prescribed Concerta,  first 36 mg for two weeks, did nothing. Now I started 54 mg this wednesday, and although I maybe get more things done, my head just wont calm down and keep on overthinking, rumilating and searching old stuck thoughts and trying to ""grab"" them.

For example; when I want to play a Video Game, most of the time I just cant get myself to start because of my thoughts, and when I do, I overanalyse and playback in my head everything that was said or happened in the game, and always restart checkpoint a 100 times to see/hear/read it again. In the end I cant go further and have to quit. Same with movies, I just constantly put it on pause and rewind a million times, a 1.5 hour movie turns into 10 hours. This also happens in Real life, I playback everything in my head what I saw and heard, over and over again.

Everyone always asks /says ""why dont you this or that (again) "" or ""you need to build structure in your life"" ( even my health providers say this ) when I again and again tell them that I can't because everything I want / need to do there is a HUGE obstacle in front of me and that my mind just wont shut up. I don't have any motivation, focus, energy etc to do it.

I really dont know what to do anymore. I have a appointment in 2 weeks again.

I am looking more into supplements now;

I tried GABA supplement and it kind of calms me and a feeling of ""numbness"".

My diet is poor and I know this can be a huge part but for all these years I havent / could not eat at day and only dinner, and now I am slowly working on it.

I have Alcohol addiction but its going far better now, at times I have been sober for 6 & 3 months but the problems were still there.

When I take a walk if I succeed, its feels good for a short amount of time, but the problems are still there at the same time.

I tried cannabis but it makes me feel terrible and uncomfortable.

I am cutting down on Caffeine as well.

Does anyone have any suggestions what I can try or do?

Thank you!",1,over
"I was diagnosed with mild ADHD at the age of 10-11. I have been on medication, Concerta on and off since (hated it but it helped and i'm a champ that don’t complain). I'm 19 now and no longer take them or see the psychologist every month. Learning to cope with ADHD is a challenge and it gets hard from time to time. But all seems well and it seems like I will make it out in life.

I've always felt that ADHD is poorly understood. Some just think that it's kids acting unruly or immmature for their age. And others think that we are afflicted with a terrible disease and look at me as if I have two heads. The only person that I truly believe understands the illness are the psychologist that helped me, obviously. They've studied for their career and there are many talented and dedicated people in their field. So I always get a bit pissed off when other people try and talk about what ADHD is.

Thanks to social media mental illnesses are getting more awareness and I couldn't be more happier. I love hearing about other people's experiences and their tips too. But I find myself often mad when I find things that for me is total bullshit. Usually on tiktok there would be little trends or stuff that say that it's supposed to stimulate  ADHD symptoms or trigger them, my friends know that I would be the loudest in denying it.

But lately I find myself confused because many people with ADHD have said to me that it does ""work for them"" whatever that means. They say that everyone has a unique set of symptoms but I dont fully understand how something could trigger some but not others. But in the face of the overwhelming majority of people with ADHD that disagree with me I believe that something is up with me.

I suffered from all three symptoms initially but at different levels of severity. I have inattention like eveyone else, something that I still struggle with today and will probably live with throughout adulthood. Hyperactivity doesn't affect me as much as it did but sometimes my friends and family do helpfully point out times where I have to calm down. And impulsivity has totally left me from what I can tell. 

These symptoms reduced overtime probably with help of medication or simply by me learning to control them out of embarrassment of being chided all the time (oh, and of course thanks to the kind people helping me). My psychologist is happy with my development and are confident that I will handle my adult ADHD well and will soon outgrow it. For months now I dont know what to think of all of it. 

I want to know what other young-adults with ADHD feel. Someone who is more like me? I find it queer that all of the people with ADHD that I see on social media are the more severe kind probably affected also by autism etc. I want to find people who are relateable to me, it feels strange to feel so out of touch with people who have the same conditon as me.

Where are the other people like me? How is life treating you all? What do you think about your adult future with ADHD?",1,##hd
"Hi! 

Over the past three years, I've been slowly suffering from peculiar forgetfulness and confusion that I didn't have previously. I'm worried it's a result of being on so many medications but I can't be sure. While it's nothing 'severe', it is concerning me , and making me feel out of tune with myself

There are of some reports of medications causing some degree of cognitive impairment, but there isn't enough data for me to be certain. **I want to understand if what's happening to me is a result of the meds, mild dissociation, or a result of trauma.**

**For context:** I am a 22 yr F, with ADHD, depression, and anxiety (Bipolar II is also a possibility).  I was diagnosed at 16 after depressive and suicidal episodes. I took Prozac till I was 18. I've been in therapy and psychiatry for the past seven years.  I work in neuroscience research, so these topics are of both personal and academic interest. 

I have been on **cymbalta, concerta and lamictal** since 2017 and just started taking low dose of **aripiprazole** a few weeks ago. 

 I've always had a very good memory and despite being a little aloof and disconnected in social situations, I've always felt ""in sync"" with myself.  After a bad suicide attempt in June 2017, I was immediately put on Cymbalta. Once school started again, I started noticing that I was forgetting appointments and classes - something which never happened in the past. It didn't even feel like I was forgetting, it felt like something was removing or blocking info for me. I'd sit for a minute thinking ""do I have anything at 4 today? hmmm. no. no I don't""  then later that day realize I had a class - a class I have every week, at 4.  In November 2017, I was hospitalized at a psych ward for some panic attacks and had some fairly ""memorable"" experiences there that might have been mildly traumatic but again - i am unsure. After the hospital, I was put on Lamictal. A few months later concerta. I was in a lot of pain that year so I don't think i prioritized my memory glitches. plus a part of me was worried that it the glitches were result of doing a few edibles (3-5) that summer (2017) since a lot of my friends who smoked weed every day also had 'glitchiness' but my psychiatrist told me it was most likely not the case (thank god). **This mild 'brain fog' continued for a bit but then got a little more noticeable last summer (2020).**

\- Decreased lamictal intake (50mg) and concerta(went from 54 to 36)

\- Summer 2020 noticed 'more glitches' - socially as well. id find myself repeat a question.felt like a robot.

\- 2021 things got visibly worse. maybe it was being unemployed for a few months with minimal social interaction. who knows

\- Feb 2021, got covid. DEFINETLY experienced brain fog. constantly doing something then forgetting why i was doing it. Also possibly because started working, tasks at work might have been confusing me. 

\-April 2021 - started taking abilify in the morning and gabapentin for sleep

\-May 2021 its just been worse. that's it. so many glitches. maybe vaccine is affecting me, maybe its just  lack of sleep . no clue. 

\----

It feels similar to my grandpa's dementia, my friends dissociative experiences, and almost resembles aspects of my friends that have done too many drugs. especially the ones who took too much adderall as a kid when they didnt have adhd. they just seem a little fried. But yes... that's what i feel and act like at times. 

If my memory use to be a fluid pool or ocean, its not a pool with certain memories out in boxes that I cant see or access unless someone opens them. 

&#x200B;

Anyone feel this way? 

**Examples:**

\- confusing appointment times despite them being written down

\- forgetting what i was about to do

\-literally hovering over elevtor up down buttons unable to press either for a moment

"I had a bad trip with acid 10 years ago and kept on smoking weed even though it gave me anxiety. I have not much control over spoken language and over both memory retrieval and retaining. 

I did some research and it spooked me out. Lots of adverse effects, and it's used to treat patients that have it far worse than me.

The psychiatric, after I told him the issues and what's caused them, said I suffer of a detachment from reality, caused by a psychotic fracture, that manifests in the form of HPPD, depersonalization, derealization, language and memory problem, and for each of these problems he claims 5mg Abilify must be the correct prescription.

I have to say sometimes I really suffer from bad memory problems, and visuospatial awareness in the house and in new places is compromised. But when I'm outside, in places I already know, I have excellent visuospatial awareness and I deambulate better than most people.

I thought that for my problems he would have prescribed me some concerta or stuff like that... I'm scared of Abilify. I also know one person who used to take it. He was... weird, uneasy, weirdly calm.

please help me :(",1,"hppd, depersonalization, derealization, language, memory problem, bad memory problems"
"My (24M) 17-year old sister has a really hard time making friends, and hasn't had anyone to text or call in years. She's extremely sensitive to criticism and takes any teasing extremely personally, which has caused her to be shunned from all her classmates as they label her as weird, not cool, etc. She used to have a great relationship with my mother, but recently started pushing her away for the sake of proving her independence, which is normal for someone her age.

It's not that she doesn't try making friends. She repeatedly tries to text other classmates, even saying happy birthday on their birthdays, and at one point bought a female classmate a small gift on their birthday just to get their attention. But you know teenagers. They end up ignoring her entirely and just think she's even stranger for doing so. Not to mention then talking behind her back amongst themselves, pushing her out even further. On her 17th birthday, my sister threw a party at her place, and no one showed up. No one.

Recently, my mother had to put extra pressure on her because she's been doing worse in school (she's never been above a C in her grades). Around that time, she claims to have **started hearing voices of her classmates outside her bedroom.** Two days after this incident, my mother gets a call from the school counselor saying that my sister **just started screaming with her eyes open while sitting in class** for no apparent reason and wouldn't stop. It's been going downhill ever since. She started talking to someone imaginary by her side, and would just sit in her room and laugh at nothing for minutes on end (not at her phone or tv). My mother has booked an emergency psychiatric session as well as several brain scans, we're still waiting on the results.

Note: I keep referring to 'my mother' doing every thing because I live in the US while my sister and mother live in **Istanbul, Turkey**. In terms of medication, she's been on Concerta for a couple years to help her focus on school but is still failing many classes despite heavy tutoring on a weekly basis. 

From what I understand, her brain just went into emergency mode to protect itself from extreme loneliness hence the imaginary friend, but we don't know what to do. I've already spoken to my mother about pulling her out of school if necessary and just focusing on her social development (she can always get a GED later, the K-12 system doesn't work for a lot of people), as well as potentially finding volunteer opportunities for teenagers where she gets to meet new people, but such opportunities don't exist in Istanbul or are very hard to find. I could really use some help if people have or know someone who has gone through something similar. Thank you.",1,
"I know the topic seems pretty weird maybe concerning but it's been bothering me A LOT so I wanted to talk about it because I feel like I am going crazy.

I am a 22yo male who have been diagnosed with ADHD when I was 13 yo (I have been using Concerta for 2 months now bc I realized I can't graduate without some help). From what I recall I didn't use to talk to myself but now I talk to myself 24/7, sometimes in 3rd (he) person sometimes in 1st (I) person and sometimes in 2nd (you) person. I got out of a psychologically traumatizing relationship that lasted a little over a year, 1 year ago.  I thought everything was going fine this past year when I was single but then I started realizing some weird stuff happening mostly when I was high.

I could hear my thoughts coming out of other peoples mouths and not just people next to me but for example a commentator on the TV too. Whenever this happened I would just get out of the room I was in and sit by myself and listen to calming piano beats or something. I did some research on it and thought it could be auditory hallucinations I still think it might be that. Then it started happening when I am sober too. I would be in a room with people and not say a single word, but for some reason other people would be saying things in my head to other people in the room.

An example of this that really bugged me was yesterday after I smoked a little bit, we were talking with some friends when I started to hear my thoughts be the conversation topic of the room. I started thinking damn I think I am too high for this (as in with other people). As I was thinking that my friend who never smokes and didn't smoke yesterday said, as he was looking at me ""Guys I think I am too high for this"". Then I said, I am too high for this, I will be fine but I gotta go and left.

This now happens when I am sober too and I don't know if it's my thoughts that are leaking or I am communicating in a way I don't understand. This doesn't happen when I am talking to someone 1 on 1 but rather happens when I am in a room with bunch of people at the same time.

I am considering taking professional help on this because it started to effect my everyday life. If anyone can relate to what I am saying or have some advice please share.",1,
"Hello, I'm a 20yo make, I used to go to A phycologist once a month, but since prices have gone up, and my income has remained the same I can no longer afford it, since I stopped going  I realized in this time that  the  only thing I was getting was ""attention"", someone with whom I could talk with and express my worries, fears and problems (and get motivation and realistic feed back of how disproportionaly exaggerated all these thing are ).

So I have arrived to the conclusion that I need someone like me/therapist ( basically a emotional punching bag ) but I don't have anyone in my life that is like that  ( and also I feel bad for the person having to listen and reason everything I have to say ), instead the only people I have are narcissists that prey on people like me/empaths and always put you down.

So the point is, does anybody have a suggestion or something that might allow me to achieve the same result I got will my therapist?

(making friends is definitely a no go, I'm too introverted and can come off as dry when it come to small talk and reaaally hate ""social obligations"" )

Also any tips to avoid getting depressed / suicidal when around narcissists ( I live with three narcissistic family members and moving away is extremely hard )

Lastly, I take Concerta 5 days a week, not sure it this affects mood in some way.

"Hello, this will be a long one so get comfy and enjoy the ride. 
I am not looking for sympathy, or looking for attention I am giving my back story and medical history so that anyone with suggestions understands more about me.

• BACK STORY •

I am currently 19 y/o, I have been diagnosed with MDD(major depression disorder), ADD (attention deficit disorder), GAD( generalised anxiety disorder), social anxiety, PTSD( post traumatic stress disorder), I have self harmed since the age group off 12 and attempted suicide twice and have fleeting thoughts on a regular basis. 
I was sexually assaulted when I was 10, emotionally abused by a family member, had a rough upbringing in general with my mum ( dad was out of the picture ) and I was exposed to a lot of things no child should see. I have been to 14 schools total, I struggle to make and maintain any form of relationship. 
In my head I am very empathetic, I understand the emotions of the people around me in my head, however when I need to put my thoughts into action, it all goes tits up. 
Also I take anti depressants and concerta for my add daily and propanalol?? (Unsure how to spell it ) for as and when required 


• QUESTION •

Does anybody know why I don’t feel any emotions ?? 

Not the typical numb due to depression or anti depressants or due to any medications, I don’t remember feeling anything, like at all. 

I feel like I am in this constant state of ‘bleh’,even when I think back to my “happiest” memories, I don’t think I was actually happy, I think I’ve just taught myself how to respond to a situation and act accordingly. 
For example, growing up if someone was crying or looked to be upset, I would act ‘sad’ aswell or on my birthday, I new I should of been happy, so I acted happy.
 I think that along the way I have taught my self which emotions to show at which times based on others reactions to a situation. 
Drs think I am depressed, but I’m not sure I understand what sadness even feels like, I think that I am considered depressed because when I’m not around other people I have know ones emotions to mimic, so my confused, emotionless self comes out to play and because I don’t feel anything, good, bad etc I am “depressed”. 

Ino this probably won’t make sense because it doesn’t even make sense to me, but I’m just hoping that ones person may have experienced something like this or know of something similar. 

I just need answers. 

Thank you and sorry for the confusing short story",1,

"Dear Reddit,

This will be a very long and serious post and I really hope that someone can realate or even help me out of this. 

First of all, the resason i do that post is to get a clear mind because all I can feel right now is massive hopelessness. There are a lot of symptoms which bother me to an extent where I cannot enjoy my life anymore.

I will start describing me as a person and what happened so far in my life to give you an insight:

I am a male in his mid-twenties, living in Switzerland. I went to college and finished after a troublesome time about 5 years ago. Since then my life has been a total mess. First, while I was about to finish school, I've been diagnosed with AD(H)D. After having read through its diagnostic criteria, I have felt really good as I've felt completly understood. I was sure that my AD(H)D made my time at school so harsh (the conflicts i got into with teachers, the short-lived attention-span, the hyperfocus ability and so on). I tried Ritalin and later Dexamphetamine and I was, for the first time, capable of focusing on the important tasks that life brings with it. I've felt quite good after I got my degree. Then I decided to attend university and i moved along with one of my best friend into an appartment in another city. I was almost overly happy and my goals to become successful an wealthy kept me going. When I started at the university I got bored really fast. As I noticed the huge amount of learning that was lying ahead, my mood quickly decreased and I almost felt a bit depressed. I told myself that it would be okay to take a year off and just chill. I started having really good times with my friend as we got into weed (cannabis). Whereas he continued his studies, I broke up with university and focused on enjoying life to its fullest. I smoked almost 10 Joints a day and I felt really good at first. I would describe it as the best time of my life so far and I am sure that this will not change. When I told my parents that I am not going to even try my studies, they told me that I have to come back to them after half a year. I managed to convince them that the subject at university was just not the right one for me I would take the test in another subject. So after almost 1 year, I finally moved back to my parents. By this time I got diagnosed the first time with low-grade depression. To counter that feelings, I decided to party a lot and just spend the money I've saved up in my teens. Also I did try some party drugs like MDMA and still smoked week on a daily basis (at this point I did not know the connection between MDMA and depression or lets say that its especially harmful for people who already are depressed). Quite quickly I noticed that after consuming 'harder' drugs theres 'down-phase' which was almost killing me. So I stopped using this kind of drugs after about 1/2 year and tried some antidepressants. As I did not have to learn for university at that time, I ceased my AD(H)D-stimulants. The antidepressants did not help and I tried almost 10 different ones back then. I felt extremely numb and as I lived a 'high-life' that time it way extremely unpleasant to somehow not feel anything at all anymore. After I finished abusing party drugs, I convinced my parents that I cannot live with them anymore and that I would be better off living alone. They accepted that and supported me financially regarding an own little appartment with 1.5 rooms somewhere near them. I started my second try at university but again could not force myself to really go there, so I abandoned it again. My parents were really disapointed and told me to find a job. I really wanted to study rather than just going to work but on the other hand could not force me to learn stuff that I was not interested in. I thought about my goals in life an tried to find out in which direction I really wanted to go in life. As I could not have figuered out a passion I just applied for a desk job and worked there for 1.5 years until I subscribed to a psychiatric day-clinic as I've felt so bad that I did not see any other option. There Ive been diagnosed with clinical relevant depression, anxiety disorder (because I had several panic attacks a week back then) and again ADD. I've received Concerta (slow-release Ritalin), Trittico (Trazodone) to be able to sleep better and Vortioxetine (which I could not take because of the insane nausea I got). After 2 months I've gotten sent home again. As I did not feel much better I went to a local psychiatrist. He wrote me a prescription which said that I was 100% unable to work and tried to treat me. I still got paid by my comany's insurance for about 1 year. Then they sent me the official resignation letter (which I expected already because I was unable to work for a very long time). Since then I am mostly playing video games at home and try to go for a walk every day. I completely lost all my hopes for my life to recover. Since about 1.5 years I experience extreme physical weakness all over my body and in addition non-restorative sleep. I litarally feel like I was 90 years old and about to die very soon. I set a new goal as this all started which is to figure out what I really have. I did a LOT of testing with different doctors and what irritates me the most is, that I do not feel nearly as depressed as I was. 2 different sleep studies told me that its probably a mental problem even if 1 lab suspected UARS as well (a special for of apnea which has not been studied a lot so far). What they did found is SIBO (small intestinal overgrowth) but even after taking the two most appropriate antibiotics, I do not feel very diffrent. I suspected CFS and UARS. I am still not sure if I am really suffering from PEM though as I feel so weak all the time anyway. I tried CPAP for a potential UARS-cure but I cannot tolerate it.

I miss my old life so much that I often dream about it. Its all gone and will probably never come back. I cannot be all in my head this time... The fatigue every day and the weakness are destroying everything. I thought about my brain taking this as an excuse for not having to get back to normal life. I am very afraid of the future and I've lost all my hope. I am nervous but tired at the same time, all day. When I try to do sports, I have to quickly stop it because I just cannot tolerate it anymore. I feel so weak that even taking a shower costs me a lot of effort. Theres a lot of pressure now on me because I know that the longer I am into this, the higher the chances of not getting out anymore. A lot of friends tell me that they are also tired and feeling the same but I know how life felt in the past (at least for me) and I can 100% tell that theres is a huge difference to how I feel now.

Now the reason why I posted all this is because I would like to know if anyone experienced something similar and got out of it again. Like waking up like you did not sleep at all, muscle weakness, no motivation, no goals and dreams, no hope that you can recover and trapped everyday in that vicious cycle. And when yoh actually try to fight it, you noticed how weak your whole body feels and how impossible it seems to every get out of it. Everyone its progressing in life but not me. Time is running and doctors cannot help. So if anyone know this or experienced this at least to some extent, please write it down. I cannot thank you enough and I know its a lot to ask to read that all and try to help a stranger but I am really stuck in a situation which I cannot escape alone.

Please guys, if someone has suggestions, I would feel so grateful for it!

Many thanks to all of you in advance!",1,"##yper, muscle weakness"
"Hey all, going to try to keep this as concise as possible, but including all the relevant information is still likely to make it a moderately long post. I really appreciate anybody who takes the time to read this.

**Relevant background/history:**

\- Mid 20s, diagnosed ADHD at 10, wasn't prescribed anything due to also having tics

\- Lots of drug abuse between 15-19. 100-500mg MDMA 1-2x/wk, mixing with psychs, etc. 18-19 cocaine a few times a week while drinking. Stopped all non-psychedelics after that.

\- Since 18ish have been tired all the time, 1-2L coffee per day, occasional month long periods of abstinence to see if coffee was the problem, always ended up back in same place

\- Depression and anxiety around 22, also late autism spectrum diagnosis. Doctor suggested that ADHD meds might also deal with the depression and anxiety. They did, and I also became way more capable of basic life tasks -- cleaning, groceries, paying bills on time, socializing, working, etc.

\- No ADHD medication worked for more than 3-6 months at a time. Since then I've tried Dexedrine, Vyvanse, Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin SR, Foquest, Biphentin, Strattera, about 5 SSRIs, 2 SNRIs, Wellbutrin, Modafinil, as well as a bunch of nootropics(racetams, choline, alcar, lions mane, uridine, etc). I've tried all dosage ranges for the ADHD medications, typically have settled at the top for both methylphenidate products and amphetamines, although I suspect with amphetamines I should have been placed closer to the middle or low end. Antidepressants all made things worse, amphetamines worked amazingly for a while and then started to induce paranoia/dysphoria/agitation/obsessiveness, methylphenidate products all worked great, although with a very short duration -- 2.5-3h effectiveness(e.g. SR would be 2.5-3h useful, 2 hours dip, repeat). Despite the duration issues, it's drastically helped everything from depression to anxiety to ADHD. Modafinil was great, but that was a different doctor and only for a month.

\- In the last year or so, I'll use methylphenidate as prescribed for a while, then eventually have 1-5 days of binging. It's not to chase euphoria as there really is never euphoria anymore, it's just to...actually be able to function for the majority of the day. I've never experienced negative side effects due to this(e.g. nothing like amphetamines, HR barely rises, no agitation or anxiety, can still sleep at the end of the day, etc.) with the exception of terrible comedowns and having less medication to actually use properly. People close to me don't notice that I've been taking more during the binges, they just notice that I'm more depressed and less productive on all the other days. Coffee is objectively more stimulating(alertness, anxiety, talkativeness, etc) than methylphenidate for me, even compared to the binges. But the doses scare me. The worst has been a few 24-36 hour binges of 600-900mg in 40-100mg increments. Lately it's more like 200-300mg/day for 4-7 days. It doesn't feel recreational, it's always functional despite being clear abuse. There are certain areas of my life that I struggle immensely to get in order with regular doses, and the binges seem to give me the clarity to actually figure out how to deal with them and take the needed actions.

\- I'm scared of talking to my doctor about this because it is the primary thing that has helped get the majority of my life in order, and at this point the only problem are the binges. I don't want to lose access to a medication that I'd be near non-functional without. I'd switch to Modafinil, but my doctor isn't comfortable prescribing it off-label, and generics from India don't have the same benefits for me, nor does Adrafinil.

\- I'm not sure what to do to stop this pattern. I already do all of the basic health stuff -- exercise, healthy eating, o3/b complex/vit D/magnesium/zinc, melatonin on days where I binge, etc.

\-One option I've thought of is keeping medication in safety deposit box and just walking half an hour to the bank every morning. Alternatively, I'm guessing taking NAC in the morning might help, possibly along with a week off. I dislike taking time off because after a few days of being useless my depression tends to get significantly worse -- it's by staying productive that I feel good about myself and avoid ruminating. One main issue is that invariably after a binge the regular doses do absolutely nothing, so I end up tapering down(e.g. 160, 140, 120, 100, 80) and then run out. So I'm thinking the most actionable time for intervention is when starting a script -- maybe I should start lower than my prescribed dose and try to get my body used to that? Or have careful behavioral interventions set into place(e.g. safety deposit box?)

**My questions:**

1. Given the history of going through all of this(22+) with the same doctor, are my worries about having the prescription taken away unfounded?
2. Even if having the prescription taken away is a legitimate risk, should I still talk to my doctor?
3. Assuming I don't talk to my doctor, any advice on what I can do to get this under control? Whether it be behavioral interventions or adjustments to my medications/supplements.
4. How likely is it that I've done long-term/permanent damage through this? The majority of the research I've read seems to point to methylphenidate not being neurotoxic or particularly dangerous as long as the abuse isn't IV/insufflation, but I'm still concerned about this. Even after taking 1-3 month breaks the medication seems significantly less effective.
5. If there's a non-negligible chance I've done long-term damage, what can I do to attempt to recover to baseline?
6. Any other thoughts or advice is much appreciated.",1,"paranoia, ##ysphoria, adhd"
"I just got back to college, and my mental health is already utter trash. Around a year ago was when I first got depressed. I did not get treated for it for awhile b/c I thought it would go away. In addition, to the depression I later realize that my ADHD meds were no longer effective and I needed a higher dose. So for the whole semester I had to deal with my ADHD and depression. During that time my depression was pretty bad. I also later discover that I have GAD. Back to the depression, where I started to self harm nearly everyday, and suidical thoughts and long crying episodes. Again due to my GAD I had tore out large amount of hair and parents thought that had cut it myself.

Today I am on Concerta 54 mg, Zoloft 150 mg and zyprexa 2.5 mg. Till this day I STILL have urges to hurt myself. I am very hard on myself which causes me to stress and have urges to SH. Like my review sheet had caused my so much stress that I started to cry and I was dying to SH. The sheet was just for review of last semester (which I forgot most of!), it merely given to aid us students, yet I am SO hard on myself and hence the stress. IDK what to do. Every time I am stressed I want to SH, I simply CAN'T live like that! I have tried other things like art, no avail. I still prefer SH over other de-stressing methods.

Advice? Please?

"Hello,

First of all, my english is not very good, so sorry for any grammatical errors, and if you could'nt understand what i wrote, please answer so i'll try to explain in another way.

I had a mental breakdown(i'll not get into details) that led me to depression 3 years ago. In the first and half of the second year, i had a lot of anxiety, depression, ruminating thoughts, but my cognitive skills were very functional: i was understanding precisely what people told me, i was reading a book or a text understanding and remembering the things that i learn, and i was talking with relatively good fluency, speaking with  spontaneity  as i always could do. Since 2015 until the end of 2017, i was prescribed with quietiapine (in 2015/2016), and olanzapine (in 2017) for insomnia, and concerta for the day sleepness. Time passed and i got no more ruminating thoughts or anxiety feelings (at least in a conscious level), and i decided to quit the drugs, and miraculously my insomnia also left and i dont struggle with it. But since 2017 until now, my cognitive capacities are falling down really hard: i cant read a text and comprehend it very well, i cant speak with proper fluency, remember words. Im also having a significant memory and emotional impairment(my memory always was very good and i could learn with facility): i cant remember things accuretly and when something happen around me, or somebody try to explain something, its like i cant internalize, comprehend and judge if i agree, disagree, or found it interesting, right, wrong, and so one. Its like my faculty of deliberation is null. My imagination is very weak too, and i feel like i have very little mental content or thoughts at all,  i cant associate things when people tell me something, remember useful informations, i feel like a robot.

When i feel angry or another deep emotion, i feel all my faculties of understanding, deliberation, judging, thinking coming back. I also can speak and remember things without struggling. But this is so rare that im hopeless. I tried to explain this to my phyisician, i think she understood, and told me that it is a emotional problem.  I think i have something similar or analogous to aphasia, and i cant hold an ininterrumpt speech for like 1 min., or tell a long story.

This is most likely a mental blockage, but im stuck in a kind of a limbo: i dont feel bad, but dont feel good either; i think i lost my capacity of feeling good or bad, or knowing if i understand or not anything. Before that(this mental breakdown was caused by drugs, i didnt use it a lot, but i think i dont have the good genetics for it, including alcohol) i always had a sharp mind, with good skills in communication, logics and math.

Im seeking for some tips or advice to overcome this mental blockage, or whatever this is (its like all my faculties of memory, emotions, decision making are underactivacted and my amigdala is overactivated). Since i'm at university, this is the most important thing to me, because im having a lot of difficulties to make progress in my academic skills.

Since my phyisician didnt give enough attention to it, i quitted last week. I seriously dont know what can i do.",1,
"Sorry this is so long.  This is the first time I have ever told my experience and wanted to include the details.

I had several head injuries throughout my childhood (I can remember 6), and suffered a loss of consciousness during at least 3 of those.  2 of those were brief, maybe 30 seconds or so, and the other one was around an hour from what I was told.  My parents never took me to the hospital for these injuries.  I'm not sure if these childhood experiences are related, but I wanted to include them in case they may be.

In my late teens and early 20s, I started to experience increased anxiety and became more unsociable.  I didn't drink a lot, but smoked weed on occasion.  In my mid 20s, I tried meth, and seemed to regain a much more socialable personality and less anxiety.  Unfortunately, I became addicted and lost everything in 2 years.  At that point, I cold-turkeyed and became clean.

A couple of years later, I was having extreme difficulty with concentration and my memory was getting noticably worse.  I went to a doctor and explained these symptoms.  I should have told him about my earlier addiction, but was just too embarrassed.  He diagnosed me with Inattentive ADD, and prescribed Concerta.  I should mention that he was a GP and did not give me any tests, just a prescription.  It seemed to help me focus a bit better, but my dosage increased from 18mg to 54mg within the year.  I'm guessing I had a higher tolerance based on my history.

I took the medication as prescribed for several years, but I felt that it was becoming ineffective and increased the dosage on my own.  I would cut one pill into thirds and take the additional third on days when I felt I needed it.  After some time doing that, I cut the pill into halves and started taking 1.5 pills/day, but I still don't feel that it is as effective as it was.

I am in my late 30s now, and really feel that my concentration and memory are getting even worse.  I routinely misread emails, miss words when I type emails, lose focus when other people are talking, and have to stop in the middle of sentences because I lost my train of thought or can't think of the word I need to use.  I also feel like if I do manage to maintain focus on something, it takes me much longer to process the information than it used to.

I also feel like my personality is changing.  I am very irratible most of the time and don't want to interact with anyone.

A few exmples:  If you were to introduce yourself to me and then immediately asked me to repeat your name, I would not be able to.  If I were to ask a question to someone, and they said something unrelated and then asked me to repeat my question, I would not be able to.  I constantly lose and forget things.  Much of the time, I feel like there is so much going through my mind that I can't prioritize, and end up accomplishing very little.

I'm just not sure what to do at this point.  I have a difficult time talking about this to anyone.  If I explain this to a doctor, I'm sure they would revoke my prescription.  Sometimes, the symptoms are worse on the medicine, but overall, I really think that the medicine does help, but don't want to be branded as an addict.  I just don't know if I have ADD or if this is something else that has similar symptoms.

Does this sound like something that I need to have checked out, or is this just part of the aging process and I am overthinking it?  If I should have it checked out, who do I talk to?  I'm not comfortable to talk to my GP about this, since I see her every month for the prescription.  My family does not talk about things like this, so I can't go to them either.  And, my husband just makes jokes if I bring it up, so he is no help either.  I am very anxious about this whole situation and don't know where to turn.",1,loss of consciousness
"TLDR: I've been on Seroquel for 3 months, and I just realized it may have made the matter a fucking lot worst.

I'm a 36yo male. My current diagnosis is dysthimia, but I also trigger very high for Borderline Personnality Disorder and Dependant Personality Disorder.

My current prescription is: Wellbutrin XR 300mg, Concerta 36mg, Celecoxib 200mg (that's for my knees), Seroquel 50mg plus an emergency dose of Seroquel 25mg when I feel bad (the emergency dose can be taken up to three times in a day).

I've been on Wellbutrin, Concerta and Celecoxib since December 2015 (other cocktails before that). Things got sour last spring, and Seroquel was introduced to help me deal with anxiety.

I just realized that, since I started Seroquel, I did the following:

- Been willingly hospitalized 4 times for suicidal ideations - I was afraid of committing the act

- Had many many other suicidal ideations, with increasing frequency and intensity

- Had more memory losses

- Became aggressive and violent. Enough to have problem with Child Protection Services and be criminally accused of domestic violence.

- Reduced my anxiety; did not gain weight; slowed down my libido; did not perturb my sleep too much

Currently reading the monographies (that website is awesome - moreover, I live in Canada! http://webprod5.hc-sc.gc.ca/dpd-bdpp/index-eng.jsp) and it mentions those things.

Moreover, I have been screened in psychopharmacology at the end of July, and the psychiatrists recommended I increased my daily dosage of Seroquel up to 300mg daily. I'm still at the starting dose of 50mg daily.

Has anyone else had this kind of issues?",1,
"When I was a freshman into highschool I made some friends smoking weed outside the school wood's trails. I ended up making a few very shady ""friends"". I was 14, smoking weed all day, skipping school, and slowly getting into other worst substances. I was Snorting adderal and Concerta drinking alcohol taking perc 30's, tried crystal meth a few times, would mix speed with klonopins and valium, and pretty much taking anything I could get my hands on.

At this time i was pretty much wasted 24/7. This is where the ""possession"" story comes into play I guess. What all started out as a joke turned into something very fucked up really quickly (and no I'm not claiming to be possessed I was psychotic). 

I would occasional play this ""exorcist"" type prank on my friends, well it was more of a funny sort of acting thing. At first it was like the funniest thing in the world then it got pretty fucked up really quickly. It all started out as a joke and then all of a sudden I was acting like I was really possessed, like it got dark, really dark. My friend's didn't think it was funny anymore and would tell me to stop.

All of a sudden, I realilzed I couldn't stop. It was like I had tourettes it was a light switch in my brain and I could go on ""auto-pilot"" and act like I was possessed. My so called ""friend"" even recorded a video of it and showed everyone in school.

During this time I finally decided enough is enough and I quit everything and distanced my self from my so called ""friends"". I changed schools, started getting good grades, and stayed away from all drugs. I noticed that my little ""possessed"" sessions dramatically reduced and it was like my friends were my ""possessed"" trigger. 

A couple months I felt back to normal. I have never had a ""twitch"" or ""exorcist"" moment sense then. It's been about 8 years now. But I look back sometimes and shudder with how fucked up the whole situation was and I'm afraid I'm going to go back to that ""possessed drug me"".
This is my deepest darkest secret and I plan to take this one to the grave.

every moment of my life is spent feeling like i'm gonna die and that everything around me isn't Real. i constantly feel dizzy and that is accompanied with feeling that I'm not attatched to my body. I constantly question my reality. I also feel like i'm drowning in a sea of air and at lunch time i cannot swallow. I also think everything i eat/drink ia drugged. Im on risperidone and concerta.

"If I posted this to the wrong subreddit, or you know of one where this post may be better suited then I'm really sorry for that, could you point me in the right direction?

This is going to be a long post but I beg that you read it and that someone out there could help me in someway even if that's just easing my nerves. Final thing before I start, a disclaimer of sorts. I know that the place to go with these types of issues would be my professional doctor and I assure you, I will be telling my psychiatrist about this at our next appointment. I'm here now because this only happened hours ago, I'm home alone and I just really need someone to help me.

A little background on me: I'm an 18 year old male with a sadly longer than I'd like list of health issues. Asthma, GERD, hyperthyroidism, ADHD, Bi Polar Disorder, Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder/Borderline Personality Disorder and I was thought of as having ""Intermittent Explosive Disorder"" when I was a little younger but it was just put down to an extreme hair trigger temper and I got over that within the last few years. I am currently only medicated for my Asthma(salbutamol) , GERD(Omeprazol), insomnia(Zopiclone 15mg/day) and ADHD(Concerta XL 72mg/day) with lithium being started next month.

Now onto what happened. I was lying in bed trying to sleep last night but the zopiclone wasn't working so I took another, not unusual for me I felt good and was trying to decide what to do. Then, with no conscious decisions made, I found myself drinking, then taking codeine, then taking more of my ADHD meds . I didn't want to do any of those things but inexplicably it did. Then suddenly I'm leaving my front door with my thick black jacket on and in the pockets are a can of lighter fluid, a very large wad of tissue paper, a beer and my cigarettes. I don't remember getting out of bed and I certainly don't remember putting all of that stuff in my jacket nor why I would want to. Then suddenly I'm in a little clearing in a forest that I don't recognize and I'm breaking branches off trees. I place the torn up tissue paper in a pile on a large slab, pile the sticks and twigs around it and squirt lighter fluid into it before lighting it. I then proceed to ""take care"" of the fire for an hour (I have never built a campfire in my life by the way). Then suddenly the fire is out (another memory lapse) and for no apparent reason, I didn't want to anyway, I threw the can of lighter fluid into the fire and just stood there above it watching. It was empty so when nothing happened, I took a lighter and dropped that in too and that did explode but I didn't jump out of the way. Instead I had a beer and watched it for a while. Next thing I know, I'm climbing from a forest, over a barbed wired fence with a sign saying ""Tresspassers will be shot on sight."" And, despite the fence putting a few nasty dings in my legs and hands, I just stood there for a while. Another blank and the last thing I remember was sitting on a rock talking on my phone with my only friend awake that early and, with the help of google maps seeing as how I had no idea where I was, he managed to find me and take me home.

But, reddit, the reason this is scaring me the most is that in the last 5 hours, I managed to leave my house fully equipped to start a fire, very dangerously started a fire in the woods, even more dangerously attempted to make the fire explode right next to me and climb through barbed wire which is clearly labelled as being punishable through being shot and I just stood in the field waiting. Firstly, taking the pills and the drinking. I had no desire to do that, none whatsoever I hate mixing medications because it could be dangerous, and adding alcohol to medication is something I just don't do. I have absolutely no recollection of deciding to pack all the stuff I did, or why I felt I had to do it. No memory whatsoever of the walk between my house, and whatever forest I set the fire (which turns out to be just over a mile and a half away). Whilst I can remember building the fire, it didn't feel like it was ME doing it, rather someone using my body to do it whilst letting me watch through my own eyes and I certainly can not remember why I was doing it especially since I was a little pyromaniac as a kid (watching paper burn etc. nothing destructive or violent) but I got over that quickly when I learned how much harm it could cause and have never set anything on fire, besides the obvious candles and cigarettes,  since. I remember throwing the lighter fluid and my lighter onto the fire but, again, have no recollection of the feelings or thoughts I was having, if I was having any. The only evidence I have of walking 4 miles through the forest to barbed wire fields are the cuts on my legs because I have no recollection of the trip there. And as for the standing in a field where the owner has made it very clear he would shoot me for being there, I have no idea what compelled me to do it. Guns are pretty scary yeah but farmers with guns earn their own levels of fear here. 

To conclude the experience and what it's making me fear: Today I had a 5 hour period in which I did many things I would never normally dream of doing with almost all of them being things that could quite easily have taken my life or at the very least, cause me bodily harm. And I don't remember doing any of it, feeling any of it or thinking anything. The best way I can describe how it felt is that during those 5 or so hours, I was in the passenger seat of my own mind. I don't know who was driving but he had a bag over my head and then randomly whip it off and ""Tah Dah!"" I can see my hands putting wood on a fire. I know they're my hands, but I have no idea why they're building a fire. So my body built that fire under direction of whoever was sitting in the drivers seat whilst I could only peek through my eyes to observe it happen.

And (finally I know, I'm really sorry to any of those who read this all) all of this, ending up in unknown places and dangerous, not knowing how I got there/why I was doing whatever it was I was doing and my past history of self harm and suicidal desires which, over the last 2 years, I managed to get on top of. All of this has one idea floating in my head:

Is my subconscious or something else in my brain trying to push me to suicide?

For any of you who committed to this offensively long post, the Harry Potter and the Subreddit of Helpful Users, thank you very much for putting the time into that when you didn't have to and I won't be upset if you don't comment because I'm sincerely appreciative for just your time. However, if there is anyone reading this who thinks they can be of any assistance whatsoever whether it just be a ""Stick in there"", or maybe someone out there could help me better understand what just happened to me, why it happened and what I can expect. Because, unless you've experienced it, you have no idea how terrifying it is to both have no idea what I might have done during the periods I have no memory of, or how terrifying the idea that today, I was not in control of my actions, any reasoning behind what my body did today was not reasoned by me. 

tl;dr - In 5 hours I took an unhealthy amount of pills whilst drinking beer, walked to a forest to set a fire, threw a lighter and can of lighter fluid on it, climbed through barbed wire into a field where I could be shot on site and ended up 6 miles from home in the woods at 2am. The bit that scares me is that all I remember from those 5 hours are very brief scenes. I have no recollection of walking anywhere, and throughout all of it I was not in charge of my own body.",1,
"Hello everybody,

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I'm an employed 28 year old full stack web developer. I've fought major depression for 14 years, as well as social phobia and anxiety disorders. I'm at a point in my life where I feel no other choice but to give up the hope that a ""cure"" will be found that will be the magic panacea that will ""fix"" me, and that it is time to accept my current state of mind as the best I can reasonably aim for.

The mind state that I'm referring to is one where I have come to accept that there will always be those situations where I am going to have a different response or feelings than the majority of other people - I have learned to work around this, whether that is the right approach or not I don't know.

I've been on a ton of SSRIs, more than I can recall off the top of my head, but here is a partial list:
- Paxil
- Sertraline
- Welbutrin
- Prozac
- Abilify

Recently I started meeting with a new doctor who prescribed me new medication: trazadone and Concerta 18mg and has cut the SSRI I am currently taking (Sertraline) in half in order to scale that back to introduce a different one in the future.

The first few days I started taking the new medications I felt 100% better, this was about 2 weeks ago.. and now it is gone and the anxiety and depression is back pretty badly. I'm so disappointed.. I thought that perhaps this was the ticket.

Regardless, I've managed to lead a relatively normal life despite the chaos inside my head. I am engaged and I am moving up the ladder slowly but surely in my job. I have a lot to be happy for, but it was hard-won and I feel I worked very hard to earn where I am.

High school I smoked a ton of pot, and dropped out in grade 11. Later by several years (age 21) I earned my GED (equivalency) and applied to, and was accepted into college. I graduated college a couple years ago with a computer programming diploma and co-founded a web development company with a childhood friend. I eventually left this company and began work at my current job as a front-end web developer. I was able to show that I could provide much more value as a full-stack developer (doing both front and back end) and I am currently in the process of proving myself with the hopes of eventually becoming exclusively a back-end developer and eventually a systems architect.

Despite the above successes, I still feel, and have always felt that I am just going through the motions and doing what is expected of me as a human being. My parents raised me properly (I think?) and I care deeply about other people, and I like to think that overall I am a decent person. It's still only because that's what I'm expected to be, not because it feels like ""me"".

I lost my dad back in September from a massive and fatal heart attack. He had been experiencing symptoms such as short breath and weakness after walking only a few steps. I strongly urged him to go to the hospital in the days leading up to his death, but he wouldn't listen. He had gone to the family doctor and tests were pending. Nobody but me recognized the symptoms of heart failure, I guess I should have done more, I feel very much at fault. Regardless, he died, the ambulance came down our rural road but then turned around, and came back 5 mins later, maybe that time could have saved him, I don't know. Yes I'm absolutely pissed about it, he was my father and I miss him dearly.

In 2010 my mom had ovarian cancer and had to have a complete hysterectomy. She recovered and was fine until June of last year when she was diagnosed with Stage 2b stomach cancer, of which the prognosis as I understood it, was about a 33% chance of survival. Regardless she had her surgery a couple months ago and is going through chemotherapy. The post-surgery biopsy was cancer-free which is amazing, so I am very hopeful.

Sorry to have gone so completely off track but I figured that some context was necessary for my next question.. what is the best way for me to meet new people in the current situation I have described? The feeling of lonely isolation is truly becoming overwhelming and I think that if I don't try to ground myself with hopefully some new friendships and communication I may just find myself completely separated from everybody.

If you have suggestions I would really appreciate hearing them I feel like I'm losing my mind

Thank you

I felt like I forgot how to converse with people on concerta, my sentences felt so calculated. I also like lost the ability to laugh and joke around. It was really weird.

"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD by a Psychologist after 1.5 days of testing. My Family Dr reluctantly prescribed Concerta. She wasn't happy to prescribe meds because she believes ADHD doesn't affect adults. She's old school. She made me feel like I was drug seeking and that this medication would make me high. She warned me about the dangers of addiction.I was honestly afraid to try it aftery conversation with her. 

So I tried it today and all it did was made me feel calm, collected and motivated me to clean my messy house. I don't feel high or euphoric or anything. It just made me feel like cleaning up a little and I did my homework. How are these meds addictive? Can someone explain?

"So my doctors have started me on very low dosage to titrate up to 30mg of Methylphenidate (Ritalin/concerta for our brand name friends) and while I only took a 10mg dose about an hour ago I’m honestly shocked at the effect.

I’ve finished my work tasks for the day, I went outside and I feel like I can see for the first time, if that makes sense, like I look at things and actually process information about it rather than just “see” it and be unable to process it because of everything else my brain was doing, I heard the birds for the first time over the sound of traffic outside my house, never paid attention to that. 

I asked myself “where did I put my Keys?” When leaving the house and… just remembered. 

I know it’s a low dose and definitely hasn’t got me back to 100% concentration but it’s taken the edge off and wow, I wasn’t expecting such a weirdly profound effect. 

Edit: just as I’ve had numerous people starting about the superman effect not lasting, the effects wane over time. I just want to say I know I stated the effect was profound but I don’t have increased focus, functional ability or bundles of energy. I’m feeling the effect because I have returned brain capacity from not over thinking, being anxious or depressed for the first time in 16 years.

Now it's classic ADHD, really struggling to get things done at home and at work, I say stupid things to my wife (not abusive or cruel - sometimes little things just seem huge), our relationships nship is struggling for all the classic reasons.

Anyhow, I hate Concerta. If I take it too many days in a row, my heart skips a beat here or there. When I take it, I get a lot of tension in my forehead. I'm 100% focused and get stuff done, but paying attention to anything else (take the garbage out, please... Pay this bill, schedule this appointment) is really difficult.

I generally am either awake at 3 am, or I wake with my alarm and my wife at six (we both work remotely; he workday starts 3 hrs before mine). I get up and try to exercise rigorously (manage 4/7 days a week). I eat a breakfast of either cold cereal and toast, or eggs and toast. I take my Concerta XR when I get to my desk at 8:30 or 9:00.

By about 30 min later, it's kick in and I am hyper focused on whatever I was doing at the time. I work fast, talk fast (and loud) and go hard till about 3:30 or 4:00 and then I totally crash. I generally forget to drink water, but if I feel hungry I will eat a small lunch mid-day.

After 3 days, the exhaustion is worse. By 4-5 days, my heart skips beats occasionally.

"I am on Concerta 18mg, which causes some agitation style anxiety, and physical side effects. Switching from generic to brand helped (smoother release). However when I upped to 27mg, the agitation/anxiety was just too much even with brand.

So my psychiatrist recommended I add Intuniv (Guanfacine ER) in. After some persuasion (i.e. nagging), my family doctor reluctantly agreed to let me try. And wow, now after 1.5 months on the lowest dose of Guanfacine (1mg), it's going really well.

It not only reduced Concerta's side effects for me, but also I noticed my RSD and ADHD anxiety have been reduced to much better levels. I don't know that I get any ADHD specific benefits out of it since the dose is so low.

\------------------------------------

*Guanfacine journey:*

The first two weeks of Guanfacine were rough: Even though I took it at bed, during the day I would feel sleepy, and it messed with my mood (weird fits of irritability, and pangs of temporary depression). My sleep was great though.

Then after two weeks it just lifted (my sleep went back to being its usual chaos). Two more weeks later I switched it to morning to see if it made the Concerta work even better but I found it was still slightly sedating and switched it back before bed.

Apparently Intuniv (Guanfacine ER) peaks around 5-8 hours after it's taken. So I might experiment with taking it a little earlier before bed to see if that is better.

I have a psych appointment coming up (new psych at my doctor's insistence) so if she agrees, I will try up my Concerta dose. And perhaps eventually the Guanfacine dose if agitation persists.",1,"agitation style anxiety, physical, agitation, fits of irritability, ##gs, depression"

The past few weeks I developed appetite supression again and nausea around the thought of eating. I do not have an ED, I want to eat but most food makes me seriously nauseous thinking about it. I’ve been in 36mg since I was 16. No change in dose. I came off the medication for a surgery I had for like two months in summer 2023. But I went back on it a year ago and had no issues with appetite suppression yet.

Is it possible that the medication can randomly cause appetite issues years into taking it?",1,"appetite supression, appetite supression, nausea, appetite issues"
"We upped my dose of concerta from 18 to 36mg. I took it at 5am and went back to sleep for an hour. Ate breakfast at 7(was surprised I was actually hungry)but by 8am I was SO NAUSEOUS.  I'm at work now(it's 9) and really feel like I'm going to throw up.

"I was on Adderall Ir 60mg/day for about 2 years, which worked extremely well. Had a girlfriend that gave me hallucinogens which threw my head for a spin and started to develop paranoid thoughts. Doctor switched me to Concerta 72mg which worked well; only downside was trouble with motivation. Switched back to Vyvanse 50mg a day and it's making me depressed as hell. I feel like 100% dextroamphetamine does not provide the same benefit as the Dextro/Levo combo that I was previously getting with the Adderall. I find personally that maybe I need to have that noradrenaline component to get me going and keep me focused. Vyvanse makes me feel dull and I get a lot of discomfort out of the medication. Does anyone feel that this is the case?",1,paranoid thoughts
"Hey y’all, I’m on 36mg of Concerta, I’ve been on others before including this one, but I’ve noticed that it just makes me almost completely numb emotionally. For example, I was dating someone and I’m just…not interested in the intense emotions of dating nor do I feel them. I still experience emotions but just not the way I used to. Everything is pretty much muted, except for when it’s really really intense, but even then there is an air of detachment. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice or explanations?",1,
"I'm super new to the meds game. I first met with a psychiatrist a couple weeks ago when my therapist recommended I try meds to help with my functional freeze, forgetfulness, & inability to focus on things I don't want to do.   
  
My psych recommended I try Concerta (18mg) first as she described it as more ""gentle"" than amphetamines and less affected by shortages. Although it did its job (I found pivoting to less-fun tasks SO manageable, felt super calm, and I was able to sit and read which I haven't been able to do for years) it also made me feel like I hadn't slept in a week and was running on lots of coffee + zero rest. When I stopped taking it, this no sleep lots of coffee feeling didn't go away for over 48 hours even though I was behaving like myself after 10. I also felt less creative, funny, silly, and MYSELF which won't work for me as I work in a creative field.

When I went back to my psych, she prescribed me Methylphenidate LA (10mg) to try as an alternative, describing it as more ""gentle"" than Concerta but still different even though they're both in the same family. It's also available in lower doses than Concerta. I'm trying to figure out what to expect (I'm quite skeptical after my mixed experience on Concerta) and I can't really find much info online about people's experiences with Methylphenidate LA or it's differences to Concerta.   
  
Anyone have experience/knowledge to share?",1,functional freeze
"Hello! I recently had to switch from Concerta to Vyvanse due to coverage issues after a move. I've been taking Vyvanse now for almost two weeks, and I was hoping someone else who's done this could tell me what the process was like? Did you do it cold turkey or was there a period where you stopped taking one before starting the other? Or did you take a lower dose of one?

I'm asking because I didn't question it at the time, but I've had a headache for a few days now and have had very achey muscles (it's possible that's unrelated though). It seems obvious in hindsight that stopping Concerta cold turkey was going to cause withdrawal lol, but with the move and all the stress involved with that, it just didn't occur to me. Now I'm wondering if maybe there was a better way to go about this? Or maybe it just would have been nice if the doctor had gone over what might happen...",1,"achey muscles, withdrawal lol"
" I got diagnosed about 6 weeks ago and started on 18mg of concerta

The first day I took the meds at 4pm and felt great honestly one of the most productive and happiest days Ive had in a while

but the following days I took it as soon as I woke up(6:30am) just felt nothing and it was just a big comparison with the first day

and every week my dose got higher but still felt nothing
and around the 4th week I got upped to 54mg of concerta and doctor told me if this feels like it doesnt work he's gonna add a non stimulant drug instead of just more concerta

Ive always had occasional headaches and light headness so nothing too bad and dry mouth whenever I breath through my mouth too much but other than that I think no side effects

But I am going through a pretty stressful time in my life right now and i'm wondering if concerta just doesnt work with me or is it my stress thats hindering the effects of concerta?

I really liked how productive I was on the first day but I just feel more and more depressed now because I want to concentrate but I just cant(constant tongue,teeth moving, fidgeting, endless thoughts)

When I told my doctor this he gave me some antidepressants to help but honestly just hated how heavy my body felt and how more depressed I felt just in general so I stopped taking it.

Adderal and vyvanse is illegal in my country so anyone that had the same outcomes with me on concerta what drug was better for you? and what exactly should I the my doctor? That I want to change my drug or that I feel it just isnt enough?",1,"headaches, light headness, dry mouth"

It's starting to take a toll on me (feeling nauseous, lightheaded, ...) so im wondering if u guys have tips on eating; good snacks that fill up quickly (good amount of calories, nutrients, ...), meal planning, ...

"I've been taking concerta for a week so far. I'm on the lowest dose. I know that it surpresses appetite, but I think it's giving me intense hunger.

My stomach feels like I've been swimming or biking after not eating for hours. Is this normal? Is this just a result of my appetite being lower and my body telling me I'm not feeding myself enough?

And it feels like my hunger just won't go away. Last night I ate two stuffed chicken breasts, and it felt like it barely made a dent. Today for lunch I had two quesadillas, and I STILL felt super hungry, so I ate a chewy bar, and still NOTHING. I don't have a huge appetite already. 

I'm either craving food constantly, so much that I can't think straight, or I don't feel like eating at all.

I eat three meals a day as always, though later because my hunger kicks in a few hours after my usual routine.

I've needed to eat multiple snacks after lunch and I only feel full for a few minutes.

Is this unhealthy? Or is it normal? Because it's getting a little annoying to feel like everything I eat is just passing through.

EDIT: It turns out, I'm super, SUPER bloated. I didn't even realize how huge my stomach got today... hopefully I don't bloat this instensly all the time...",1,

So I'm a female and I'm 50. I was diagnosed in my mid-thirties and I've been taking concerta ever since. I'm sure it's because of changes in hormones but concerta has stopped working. 

I went to this 'ADHD specialist' who convinced me that adults should no longer be taking a stimulant medication. We should 'ALL' be taking a mood stabilizer (Wellbutrin) and a non-stimate ADHD med. I live in Canada and strattera is the only one available.

"Hey all. I've been in this community for a while now and have finally been prescribed medication. I've been prescribed Ritalin when I was a young child, and it made me into a zombie. I've also taken Adderall as a child. Now, having been rediagnosed in my early thirties, the psych center that works with me gave me generic for Concerta 18mg to start out and see how I do. I already took one pill yesterday which gave me an energy boost and the slight increase in socializing. I decided that today, I would take two pills (per her directions if one wasn't enough). Yes, the energy boost is there again, and more desire to socialize. And, I guess me writing this post is also an example of what it's doing to me, as I normally don't have the motivation to create posts. However, I will add that I am feeling a bit \*light-headed\* now...

Here's the thing. I have read others' posts on how the right medication is like ""turning a \*light\* on in their head"" and making their lives a ton better. I am not really experiencing that yet. It's been many years since I've taken methylphenidate, to note.

So, I would like to ask:

Is it common for these meds to take time to build up in the body like with antidepressants?

What are your thoughts on Trigen manufacturer and generic Concerta?

"Hi, 38M diagnosed and medicated almost 3 yrs ago. Unfortunately, in my country, only methylphenidate is available for ADHD treatment.

The thing is, I've been trying with several brands here, and the only one I \*feel\* that works is Concerta (now I'm on 36Mg) but the thing is that when the medication wears off I feel VERY IRRITATED, I feel like I'm Bruce Banner in the middle of his Hulk transformation, except for the green skin and super-strength, etc.

I take one pill at the morning and at 6/7PM I became the most unpleasant person to be around. It's not that I'm the nicest guy around, but I feel like I'm just one click about to lose it and end up arguing with my family, just because they're around me at that time. And that sucks because I never get completely aware that my behaviour is fueled by the medication (or lack of it) until it's too late

A while ago, my doctor suggested to take 2 pills (1 of 36Mg at the morning and another of 18Mg at 1/2PM) in order to ""soften"" the curve where my medication leaves my body, but the thing is 

a) Still with 18Mg the same thing happens (anger when the medication wears off)

b) I can't get to sleep which means I have to add Clonazepam just to get to bed and I always forgot it so it was always late.

In fact, it made my thoughts way clearer and ""stronger"" in my mind, to an extent that it really intensified my daydreaming and, as a consequence, made me more inattentive to the external world. In that sense it was great bc it allowed me to manipulate and get better conclusions from the ideas and arguments I had in my head. Also, on the highest dose I found myself somehow more extroverted, and more able to control myself emotionally.  
  
Basically it was great in a cognitive sense, but not in an emotional one that would let me get stuff done and actually focus on the external world. It in fact made me focus more but just on my own thoughts, to an extent I was heavily daydreaming.

I struggle with other mental illnesses (to include anxiety, depression and cptsd), all of which I’ve previously tried medication for; so I figured it’s time to try ADHD medication in hopes that it was the missing puzzle piece. 
I started off on 36mg of Concerta about 10 months ago, and it made me feel a euphoric but calming sensation. I felt overwhelmingly happy while also being able to concentrate for the first time in forever. That feeling quickly died down after a couple months of taking it (it also made it extremely difficult to sleep at night, even if I was taking it as early as 8am), so I decided to try Adderall. My psychiatrist recommended a dose that was equivalent to the dose that I was on Concerta, which is 15mg of Adderall, and so far I feel just about nothing from it. I’ve tried Adderall once “recreationally” at 36mg and felt like I drank a lot of coffee, but felt pretty focused.

"Yep. Per Wikipedia. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate#interactions

When methylphenidate is coingested with ethanol, a metabolite called ethylphenidate is formed via hepatic transesterification,[104][105] not unlike the hepatic formation of cocaethylene from cocaine and ethanol. The reduced potency of ethylphenidate and its minor formation means it does not contribute to the pharmacological profile at therapeutic doses and even in overdose cases ethylphenidate concentrations remain negligible.[106][105]

Coingestion of alcohol (ethanol) also increases the blood plasma levels of d-methylphenidate by up to 40%.[107]

I thought it was new because in 15 years have I never seen a patient prescribe this and had literally never heard of this med before so figuring it was new or had just been blown up on TikTok, I looked it up and saw that it is literally just methamphetamine but has been around for decades. I looked up the reviews on drugs.com and it had the highest review of any ADHD med by a LOT.  I think it was almost 9 and people were raving about the lack of side effects and positive effect. I did notice that it had a dose range of 5-25 mg but only comes in 5 mg pills with no XR which I guess might be cumbersome. 

Curious, I asked a few prescriber friends of mine and they had never heard of it or made this poo poo face and said well we don’t prescribe that. I couldn’t really get any answer as to why so I’m wondering what your thoughts on this med are.

 With the ever growing stimulant prescribing going on along with a huge increase in burnt out 35-40 year old lifers who nothing works for anymore as well clients reporting horrible side effects from constantly being bounced from cheap generic to cheap generic because of the shortage. I wonder why this isn’t prescribed more.

Are these reviews all just from addicts who are happy being high on methamphetamines or is there some clinical benefit to only using the methamphetamine isomer? is it just misunderstood, or is it not prescribed for other reasons? Or is it social stigma? I can imagine parent picking up the meds for their child and freaking out when they saw the generic written as methamphetamine on the bottle but you would have absolutely no idea how many parents  come to me complaining that their child on ADHD meds won’t sleep and is having anxiety, and are then shocked to learn that Ritalin, Concerta and Adderall even are also stimulants that can be abused similarly to street drugs and though they are theorized to react differently in the brains of children with ADHD that can have similar side effects.

"Hi, 

I take a lot of meds, and I feel some recent changes have had a bad impact. I'm 25 F. I was diagnosed at 16, and 4 months later had my first acute major manic episode. The first drug I was prescribed for my bipolar was lithium. I'm also ADHD which was been  problematic to combine with bipolar maintenance therapy--but given I was in school, I really needed it to focus. At the time I was taking Concerta for ADHD and then lihtium. Soon lamictal was added. When I was 17 I developed severe chronic insomnia which was triggered and sustained by mania/hypomania. I started taking seroquel to help sleep along with xanax. I tried Ambien and Lunesta with no real success. Then within the next year I went on Abilify  at 17. My doses have increase a lot. I always hated lithium bc it gave me horrendous tremors among other side effects. I went as high as 600 at that time, one or two times it was bumped to 900 for an acute manic episode and then was lowered back to maintenance levels. I liked the lamictal because it gave me no side effects that I was aware of. So many psychiatric drugs cause weight gain which I always wanted to avoid. I forget my dose back then, but it couldn't have been higher than 400mg/day of lamictal. I always preferred to bump up that dose than the lithium or abilify since the side effects weren't an issue. Well I read online the highest dose prescribed with being used with Valproate is 700. Once I got up too 600mg/day, I asked my doctor if we could go up more, since I remember him saying it has been prescribed at 800 in more clinical settings. So I'm at 800 now--400mg twice daily. One would think my levels would be sky high at the dose, but I guess I have a tolerance issue with most meds, my liver must be fired up all the time. My last blood levels showed I was actually UNDER the normal threshold for the therapeutic levels of lamictal. 2 months ago my new psychiatrist raised my lithium to 1200mg. It's awful, and when I had blood levels done 3 weeks later I was at 1.91. Which, is .1 away from exceeding therapeutic levels. Also since I'm that close, if I get dehydrated, I encroach toxicity. I was hyomanic all summer with sleep problems. He raised the lithium to curb the mania and get me better sleep. Also my trazadone dose was increased. Yet I'm mixed and rapid cycling, even being manic, ultimately I feel very depressed. I want to convince him on thurs to lower or eliminate lithium. I was researching other alternatives, off-label maintenance drugs. I found Tegretol and was interested. Unlike most other drugs I've had to take to stabilize things, almost no weight gain was reported (I'm still trying to lose the 40lbs that Risperdal put on me during the 7 months I was on it. In 5 months since I stopped, I've lost 36). I read though that Tegretol can actually fire up the enzymes in the liver, that can lower the efficacy or levels of other meds. I also read that sometimes lithium and tegretol can be used together. I figure since it's the same drug class as lamictal, I could discontinue that--bc I don't think anyone will prescribe more than 800. Maybe a new drug will help. If I did lithium and tegertol together, I could lower the lithium a lot. If I'm sleeping well--which tegretol is supposed to help, then my seroquel dose can be lowered too--and eliminated soon. Hopefully all my meds that are meant for stabilizing can go down. In terms of sleep, my dose of xanax would have to stay the same until I can gradually lower it. I take 4mg before bed with 300mg of trazadone and 300mg of seroquel. I used to have to take 6mg of xanax. It's awful I know. I've just been on some of these drugs so long that I have built a tolerance. Since my diagnosis 9 years ago, there were some other drugs that were tried, I can't even remember all of them, but until last September it was mostly the same. Coming off the abilifyi in october helped so much with school. I was no longer foggy. The risperdal was awful but it's over now. This depression is killing me though bc I'm failing in school bc of it. I feel overwhelmed. I read that while lithium is the classic choice for bipoiar 1 and 2, someone who has more mixed episodes or a subtype have been found to respond better to Tegretol, for example. So, my question is mainly, since I've exhausted the lamictal and want to lower/eliminate the lithium, but not jeopardize stability or sleep, would tregetol seem like a reasonable suggestion to bring before my psychiatrist? **(once again, I'm not trying to substitute your opinion as medical advice, it's just I want to know in the brief time I see him on thursday, whether this suggestion I came up with makes any sense--worth actually discussing with my doctor)**

"it’s more of a potency thing, no? the methyl group would make it more nonpolar and thus the crossing of the BBB would be more intense/rapid in theory. i’m surprised it lasts so much longer. I figured it would have more of a euphoric effect due to the nonpolarity, and likely a higher neurotoxic effect due to that as well. there is probably a mg to mg conversion out there, and I wouldn’t doubt that the majority of the neurotoxicity is from people using higher dosages. 

if street amphetamine was only used at 100mg and street meth at 5, I bet we’d see significantly more neurotoxicity in the street amphetamine. 

I can see it having a lower side effect burden due to being able to use lower doses to get similar efficacies. maybe a way to combat the euphoria/rush of meth would be to make like a lismethamphetamine or something along those lines, but then the duration of effect would be way too damn long. i’m assuming there’s an intermediary between instant release and vyvanse duration, but who knows.

"it definitely is more addictive, and I would bet money on the rush being a big aspect of addiction. they are probably very similar in terms of tolerance and physical dependency, but psychological addiction is pretty much directly attributed to how it feels. 

i’m pretty sure this is why people are more reluctant to prescribe alprazolam instead of diazepam, due to the rapid onset of action and the possible “rush”. 

if you gave 100 people heroin and 100 extended release oxycontin, I guarantee that a higher percentage of the heroin users would be fiending for more in the short term, but over a longer period of time both would have similar numbers, but this is mostly due to now the physical dependence taking effect. the short term is how people get hooked and it’s a lot easier to get hooked when the sensation is significantly better. who is more likely to look for a second dose? someone who took an extended release oxycontin for the first time or someone who just shot up IV heroin for the first time?",1,

"Hey all.

I need some advice. (I do have a therapist and psychiatrist. They know that I am still struggling.)

How do you jump start motivation to do ""things""? 

I have been on a range of medications for over two years now. I started on Lexapro, switched half a dozen times to other meds due to side effects, and am now on Prozac and ADHD stuff. 

Before meds, I was a bit of a adrenaline junkie. I went hiking, biking, traveling, etc. Playing video games was a fun past time I could do for HOURS. I actively did things or would hyper focus on new hobbies all the time. 

I just had extremely bad anxiety and boughts of debilitating depression. 😔

Since starting meds to help curb the anxiety/depression, I now struggle to find the drive to do ""fun"" things. I can't play video games for very long. Hiking is more like a chore. And pretty much everything I do for fun, I am doing it because I am forcing myself to be active with the hope that I can jump start the motivation/hyper focus of something. 

Any tips on how to get out of the funk? It's kind of like I am stuck in constant executive dysfunction. 

My meds:
Prozac
Concerta 
Strattera 
Vit D

At least my anxiety is better! I just somehow lost all desire for fun and now just would rather sleep to pass the time. Lmfao.

"I have had depression for my whole life. Been on Lexapro and when my doctor took off I discovered what sex was really like.

One year ago (after 2 years with no antidepressants) my doctor tried Paroxetine, and my orgasms disappeared. The experience with this med was a whole disaster. I got more suicidal than ever, flat emotions, etc, contacted my doctor and had to immediately get it off. 

Currently, after one year, I feel like I still can’t “fully” orgasm. The thing I noticed today, testing it on my own, was that when I “orgasm” it doesn’t really get to the climax. Which is subtle but that’s what happened when I was on Paroxetine. I get too sensitive and can’t continue. The difference today is I feel a lot of pleasure and get really close to it. It’s like my neurotransmitters just refuse to keep “walking around”. Like an eternal edging.

Although I feel pleasure and have physical reactions, such as my body shaking and my breathing changing, it doesn’t finish…

"I started to take a couple non-drug substances on a whim; I happened to have them around. One is a mineral and one is a vitamin; they're extremely common things that people might take...if you were going to take some vitamins and minerals to bolster what you're getting from your diet then these would be right at the top of the list.

In addition to these two things, I also have Concerta (a formulation of methyphenidate) in place, but I'm confident that the Concerta has been a constant and that the addition of the two other things has caused the big improvement. I don't know whether the two other things ""activate"" the Concerta; I could go off Concerta and see how much the other two things help me when Concerta isn't in play. I feel the impact of the other two things immediately when I take them; not sure what that might mean. 

Thanks to the addition of the two things, I was able to go from 45mg escitalopram to zero with zero withdrawal symptoms. I feel a lot better and my mood is a lot better. I have a lot more energy. I find this experience to be super weird. It's only by sheer accident that I even had these two non-drug substances kicking around. 

I have no idea what's wrong with my brain and why these two things that I introduced had such a profound impact. I can imagine that my response to these two things is abnormal; if it was a fact that a significant percentage of people had this kind of reaction to these two things then there would be enormous buzz about that fact, so I assume that I'm an outlier. 

I have ADHD. I find it a bit daunting to try to ascertain whether you are (as an ADHD patient) likely to benefit from one or another non-drug substance. The science doesn't seem to be super helpful in telling you what to try, though I guess that the science does give you a list of things to try. And if you don't get an immediate and powerful impact from taking the non-drug substance, how do you figure out whether it's actually helping? See here:

>A sufficient supply of micronutrients, such as minerals and vitamins, is required for normal brain development. Micronutrient deficiencies may contribute to dysfunctioning of the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of ADHD [3]. Associations between symptoms of ADHD and mineral and trace element status regarding magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, and selenium have been proposed. However, the findings of studies exploring such associations have been inconclusive [22].

>Hair trace element and mineral levels were examined in 52 boys with ADHD and 52 typically developing boys [23]. Statistically significant reductions in hair copper, magnesium, and manganese were found in children with ADHD. In regression models, hair zinc and magnesium levels were inversely associated with the severity of ADHD [23]. Serum mineral and trace element levels were measured in 68 children with ADHD and 68 typically developing children [24]. In comparison with controls, serum levels of chrome, magnesium, and zinc in children with ADHD were reduced by 21%, 4%, and 7%, respectively, while serum copper/zinc values were 11% higher [24]. The role of these changes in the pathophysiology of ADHD remains to be investigated.

>Further studies on magnesium, zinc, and iron in ADHD have been published recently.

>The findings of several observational studies have suggested a role of vitamin D in the pathophysiology of ADHD. The pooled data of a meta-analysis including eight observational studies (with 2655 children with a diagnosis of ADHD and 8669 healthy controls) showed statistically significant reduced 25(OH)D levels in children with ADHD compared to controls [34]. Large cohort studies are required to investigate whether vitamin D-deficient infants are more likely to develop ADHD in the future. A systematic review and meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials with 256 children, examining the effects of vitamin D supplementation as adjunctive therapy to methylphenidate on ADHD symptoms, showed a small but statistically significant improvement in ADHD total scores, hyperactivity scores, inattention scores, and behavior scores [35]. However, these effects were limited by the low to very low quality of evidence provided by the available studies.

So sorry if that post is all over the place right now.

I can’t seem to get myself to take my meds everyday, and I feel like I’m losing my footing from being on/off the entire time. Just a small thing happened and my world is crashing down on me once again.

I’m on Escitalopram 15mg currently and recently got off Seroquel in exchange for Promethazine 25mg. I feel like since I stopped taking Seroquel (my doctor said that can’t be, but it made my heart race so bad) my sleeping issues make my days just pass by, and that not in a good manner.

I heard so many good things about Promethazine, but it just doesn’t seem to do anything for me. Funnily enough, they knocked me out bad when I drank, but I’m not sure that’s a good idea.

Did anyone else experience heart issues from Seroquel? Is there a realistic alternative to Ritalin and Concerta? I took these from childhood to teenage, and apart from absolutely not being myself, they made me feel focused and at ease. But I can’t afford going back into robot mode. Any experience on whether or not I can drink on my current meds? I don’t wanna risk anything, but the temptation of a full nights rest is there.

I still have 2.5 months until my next appointment and I’m just fishing for anything that I could mention to my psych next time.

Thank you for reading and I hope any of that was coherent, haha.

"I take escitalopram at night. One night (a couple night ago) I did a 10% reduction (as a first step in my careful tapering process that will take months to complete). The next day I was already in kind of bad state. I'm just really tired and non-functional. And my Concerta medication (for ADHD) suddenly doesn't work, which is *really* interesting; it might be a random coincidence that the Concerta suddenly stopped working the very day after the dose reduction, but obviously that would be quite a coincidence, so maybe there's a good reason why the dose reduction would interfere powerfully with the Concerta. 

I've planned out a very slow taper. Maybe I'm not going slow enough. But is the idea is that you're not supposed to experience any withdrawal symptoms; you're supposed to go slow enough that no withdrawal symptoms ever arise. I'm not feeling any anxiety or serious depression or anything like that...I guess I'm *mildly* depressed but I'm not sure. It's nothing bad or serious. And then I'm just very tired and non-functional. Does what I'm experiencing count as ""withdrawal symptoms"" such that I should abort the taper? I mean, is the taper supposed to be slow enough that there's *literally* zero disturbance each time you decrease the dose?",1,

Hi! I'm a high school junior and I've been taking Concerta (54 mg) for 3 months for ADHD. I'm also prescribed Ritalin for after school use but haven't used it yet. Meds have changed my life - they have been really helpful. 54 mg is the best dosage so far and I'm happy with it. But meds also caused some issues like insomnia, anxiety, and the sometimes feeling of exhaustion. 

In my last appointment, my psychiatrist wanted to talk about my exams and other experiences after starting meds. As much as I can study now, there haven't been any improvements in my exam results. He asked if I'm perfectionist and I answered yes. He asked if I experienced any anxious feelings during exams, had racing heart, obsessions, self confidence etc. 

 I don't feel anxious except the last 10 minutes of the exams. I experienced heart palpitations in the first month after I upped to 54 mg. And I don't have any confidence issues. I experience the anxiety caused by meds but I manage it, it's nothing more than anxiety caused by coffee. There haven't been any issues besides that school caused extreme emotional damage until I got used to school after midterm holiday and my new dosage. 

He said that he thinks meds cause too much anxiety on me, that I'm a really detailer person, exhausted feelings are a serious matter, I shouldn't work on too many fields etc. He mentioned some notes from past appointments as an example. He said I work too hard and set superordinate goals, which he thinks is worrying.  And he prescribed me Selectra (Sertraline) 50 mg for anxiety. I haven't ever thought that I might have anxiety and I'm mostly happy with my life. I solved many of my problems. I can make real progress. I'm hopeful about my future. 

That's why the prescription surprised me. I feel like he might have manipulated me to say things that meet the diagnosis criteria for anxiety. Because I many times said there hasn't been any significant increase in my anxious feeling before/after ADHD meds. I also feel like he could be right, I really push my self too much for success. ADHD meds have been helpful and sertraline may be helpful too. But, I'm also afraid of possible negative effects of it if it's mis-prescribed. I don't what to do, could use any advice.",1,"racing heart, heart palpitations, negative effects"
"I’ve been on Zoloft for about 2.5 years now and it’s been great. However, I do have some side effects, one of which is some emotional blunting. It’s not terrible, it’s not like I’m completely apathetic, but I notice that sometimes things like music and movies won’t deliver as much of an emotional response as I’m used to. 

In addition to Zoloft, I take Vyvanse for ADHD (it’s basically Adderall) and I’ve noticed that my emotional blunting is typically more pronounced on days that I do not take my Vyvanse. I tried Googling and couldn’t come up with anything that directly links amphetamines to improved emotional blunting, but I found [this wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amotivational_syndrome) about amotivational syndrome that mentions pairing SSRIs with a medication that boosts dopamine levels as a way of treating SSRI-induced amotivational syndrome. It reminded me of a conversation I had with my doctor about potentially adding Wellbutrin into the mix for exactly this reason to help counteract some sexual side effects I was having. And then it hit me - amphetamines work by increasing the levels of dopamine in the brain and the Vyvanse might actually be counteracting some of the emotional blunting effects of the Zoloft!

"Good morning everyone (Portugal here) 

Here i am once again trying to figure out if i should try something or not (i always do a full range of homework before trying any new medicine ). 

Almost two years ago i have been diagnosed with ADHD - innatentive , always been a day dreamer with low energy for most things in life besides hiperfocus that would occur from time to time. I have suffered from somnolence as my sleep has always been very aggressive (screaming , shouting, kicking and things like that) . 

I have never taken any medication for anything related to mental health but here i am :) 

First i tried Concerta but didnt go well with it, then Elvanse that went way better for me. Then a very small dose amitriptiline before bed for my sleep and that has made a huge difference. Wellbutrin for over 6 months now and it has been the best one (even better than Elvanse) for physical energy . 

So ... i have been sleeping 8h a night and it has been great ! I wake up feeling rested and no need to nap as i used to (for years and years) . 

BUT i feel that my low grade depression and low mood is still the same. I also suffer from endometriosis (advanced) even though with the pill i dont have any pain. My prolactin levels is around 20 - 30 and that is higher than the range but not enought to think it is a pitituary thing.. i looked around and it has to do with endometriosis . It could be this or something else but i have ZERO sex drive. I dont even think about it but i have a partner who do :P 

Anyway, Abilify / Aripiprazol has been suggested from my doc as a way to lower prolactin but at the time i have said No right away . Now i am considering as it could help my Wellbutrin work better and maybe help with libido?

Has anyone have a good experience for this ? wellbutrin and Abilify (i also take a very low dose Elvanse but that one i can live without) and libido getting better or should i be looking for something else ? 

I know SSRIs kill libido so i am not yet considering those.

Been feeling some physical anxiety and just increased anxiety overall.. since I’m taking escitalopram and concerta I wanted to stop atarax since when I first started the 27 mg concerta I wasn’t feeling the same anxiety at all, but it’s just kinda of getting worst now.. can this be atarax withdrawal? If so how long will it last ?",1,"physical anxiety, increased anxiety, anxiety"
"Hi all, I've been on Zoloft and Bupropion for anxiety/depression for about 3 years now. I'm also on Concerta for Attention Deficit Disorder.

Last week, I had laparoscopic surgery to remove a couple benign cysts in my abdomen. I was anxious about being on antidepressants and a stimulant in combination with the anesthesia that I would be given for my surgery as well as the pain medication to be prescribed afterwards, so I stopped taking all my medication a day before the surgery. I didn't resume taking my medication like normal until about 3 days after my surgery (this was NOT recommended to me by a doctor, it was something that I came up with and did completely on my own).

My question is, is 3-4 days without the antidepressants enough time for withdrawal symptoms to occur? I'm experiencing horrible insomnia, dizziness, strange dreams if I'm able to doze of for a nap, and mild nausea. How long can these withdrawal symptoms last now that I'm taking the antidepressants normally again? It should also be noted that these symptoms are most likely not associated with my surgery, because if they were, it would be indicative of infection around the incision sites, and I would be seeing swelling/irritation or experiencing a fever if this were the case.",1,"horrible, insomnia, dizziness, strange dreams, swelling, fever"
"Not sure if I'm asking about Serotonin Syndrome or not because I'm asking about a situation where the symptoms are: tremors/twitching and massive and constant fatigue. I read a bit about Serotonin Syndrome; fatigue doesn't seem to come up in connection with it, though tremors/twitching are talked about. Cause seems to be high-dose escitalopram and maybe Concerta or lithium or guanfacine having some kind of interaction with the escitalopram and/or slowing the clearance of it.

But I don't get how it works if indeed it's mild Serotonin Syndrome. I'm interested in how it works. Do the symptoms stop as soon as serotonin levels return to normal? And if you took a large dose of escitalopram and then reduced the dosage to a normal level then wouldn't you just be talking about like a couple days for the extra serotonin to be cleared from your system? How long till the elevated serotonin clears out of the system? And then how long for the tremors/twitching and fatigue to go away?",1,"tremors, twitching, massive, ##remors, twitching, tremors, twitching"
"I’m on Effexor, Abilify, and Concerta. I’m weaning off of them by taking half doses now and in two weeks I have to stop taking them completely. I’ve been taking Effexor and Abilify for the past year and Concerta since I was in high school. 

I’m worried that I’ll become suicidal when I stop my medication, but I really want to take this sleep study. My psych thought it was a bad idea to stop taking my medicine, but the sleep doctor wouldn’t bend on that rule. Has anyone experienced suicidal thoughts after stopping their meds for just two weeks?",1,suicidal thoughts
"19f, ADHD Inattentive. Have tried Concerta, Vyvanse, Adderall, either didn’t work or side effects were too severe.

I started bupropion yesterday, and my side effects were quite unlike what my doctor had described to me (agitation, headache, irritability, dry mouth, anxiety, etc…) so I’m wondering if anyone else has had this experience, and, if so, if these feelings went away.

About two hours in, my body began to feel “heavy,” and i began to have a very “flat”/empty feeling. I felt like I was having to work very hard to appear normal to my classmates. My already-problematic brain fog increased significantly. This escalated into me feeling incredibly spaced out, and as if my mind were completely blank.

Later in the day, this feeling got worse and I began to feel very detached from myself, and I think at that point it became difficult to hide. I blamed it on a headache and went home from sports early, but on my walk home I felt like I was almost in a dream, as if i was floating and just watching life pass by without actually being a part of it in the present. 

This feeling persisted and when one of my friends called me, I had an incredibly hard time really hearing everything she was saying, and there were moments in where my mind went completely blank when i would have to respond and my end of the phone would just go silent, and she would ask “you there?” and I would blame it on bad connection or something.

No notable positive effects on my motivation, mood, energy, or ADD, which is what it was mainly prescribed for. Perhaps some of my overthinking/anxiety was quieted, but just because my head was so empty. Not sure it was a great trade.

I am really discouraged, because i really want this medicine to work for me, but I can’t find many anecdotes with these symptoms that didn’t end up having to switch.

Did anyone else begin with these symptoms? And if so, how did it end for you?",1,"irritability, dry mouth"
"Right now, two days in a row I got really fast heart rate in the middle of a day for no reason. When I measured it yesterday it reached 140 bpm even though I haven’t done any demanding activities that day, it stayed like that for around an hour I think. I took some herbal pills for heart rate, that my doctor prescribed me a year ago (then it was for heart problems caused by concerta, that I no longer take), but I don’t think they helped much. 

I have no other guesses for what might be causing it, other than brintellix, because I raised my dose to 10 mg last week (I’m on it for two weeks in total). My psychiatrist said it shouldn’t interact with my other meds (atomoxetine 80 mg, mianserin/lerivon 10 mg and hrt 20 mg testosterone a day), that was the whole reason he prescribed me brintellix and not wellbutrin or something and I don’t think any of my other meds are causing it, because I haven’t been changing doses lately or anything like that. 

I checked on a flyer (idk what it’s called) to see if it’s listed as a possible side effect, but it’s not. Is it something that even can be caused by brintellix alone or by it interacting with my other meds? Should I contact a doctor immediately (not even sure if it’s possible tbh) or is it normal and will calm down after some time?",1,fast heart rate
"I am on 54mg Concerta for ADHD, and 200mg of Lamotrigine for bipolar 2. I recently started 150mg of Wellbutrin to help with my depression & I've heard of people having seizures on this medication so I'm a little worried...

"So i ve been on prozac along with concerta for a good while.

"i was diagnosed with adhd in second grade took meds for maybe half of second grade. stopped, and when I joined the military I decided to get medicated again because my coping methods did not align with the tempo of my unit. I have been on adderall for about 2.5 years and recently asked for an increase of dose. i am really anxious when talking to doctors because I dont trust them or myself but they thought I didnt need an increase dose but instead think im depressed and gave me mertazapine i dont really respond well at these appointments and just say yes because I want it to be over. these meds just make me tired and put off things and not give a fuck about anything, lack in energy and motivation for anything that stimulates me and honestly if I was more stupid I would kill myself but I know these feelings are temporary and they are not welcome it just makes me feel slow and I already had problems sleeping long but I have no problem sleeping 22 hours and I heard the negative side effects are temporary but what are the positives I feel no positives im just confused any advice will help.",1,

"I’m currently taking concerta for adhd, pramolan for sleep (it’s anxiety meds but as a side effect it helps me sleep) and just started seronil for my depression. My parents are very anti medication and they only agreed for me to take meds, because of pressure from my psychologist and psychiatrist. But also their reasoning is that I have to function well because I have finals and graduation in less than two months, but after that when I’ll have nothing to achieve (fuck college or my well being I guess) I won’t need any of them, so they’ll probably take my meds away and try to treat my conditions with sun and yoga I guess.

"I've been taking 450mg of Wellbutrin for over a year now and I've been having horrible sleeping problems as in I cannot stay awake during the day. I also take 54mg of Concerta. Has anyone else experienced Wellbutrin making them tired instead of giving them energy? For the past few days I've been taking it at night instead of in the morning and it seems to be making a difference. I have been sleeping upwards of 16+ hours a day. I've found in the past I tend to react differently with stimulants. Caffeine doesn't work on me. That's why I take methylphenidate extended release so it's spread out throughout the day. When I first started taking Wellbutrin I didn't have this problem. Last August I got covid and was really sick, my vitamin D dropped very low but we have since corrected that problem and I still sleep like the dead. Wellbutrin is the only antidepressant that has worked for me...I've taken so many different ones in the past so I don't want to go off of it, but I'm afraid it's causing my sleeping problems.",1,"sleeping problems, sleeping problems"
"So I'm currently on 20mgpd fluoxetine and 10mgpd mirtazapine and my partner told me I've been acting off after starting the mirtazapine. I've since the beginning felt a bit iffy about being on fluoxetine because it's an SSRI and I know how bad everyone's experiences have been on them but this makes me want to stop all of them to go back to behaving normal towards her.

(I'm also on concerta for adhd but that's not something I want to quit because I need it)

Like my depression I feel has gotten better after starting these but I can't stand having my partner hurt because of it. So my question really is, what would happen if I was to just stop taking both of these tomorrow? Will I feel like shit and in what way?",1,acting off
"Hopefully this is not a long one

I’ve been seeking therapy for my ADHD (which I also just recently realized that I suffer from ADHD) 

I was prescribed ADHD medication (Concerta) which may I add, it noticeably tamed my impulsivity and It’s doing me justice. 

However, I was also prescribed an SSRI (Seroxat paroxetine hydrochloride) for “generalized anxiety and whatnot” 

I have had impulsive tendencies and I’ve learned to be aware of it (not stop it or control it though), but the SSRI medication amplified it, in fact my impulsivity skyrocketed to the level, where I feel it added useless “wants” in my subconscious to be impulsive about. It completely annihilated my awareness of it, and when I stop taking the meds, I try to piece things together but with no avail. it almost feels like I wasn’t in control at all. 

Of course, knowing what an impulsive behavior is, and knowing that mostly there’s no thought process behind the whys and hows, I usually tend to confront myself after doing something impulsive, and I also tend to rationalize it for my sanity. 

Thankfully nothing drastic or costly happened to me or to anyone.

Has anyone had the same experience with any SSRI? Is there something between the lines that I should be aware of?",1,
"My story:

During my first visit to a psychiatrist (who subsequently retired) I was offered an SSRI or a stimulant.

In retrospect, I THINK this meant that he was unsure whether I had ADHD or depression and wanted to use a medication trial to help figure that question out. But he retired the month after I saw him so I ended up having to find a new doc. 

Spent the best part of a year trying ADHD meds: Ritalin, Concerta, Vyvanse.

Loved them all because they got rid of my problems with motivation and energy. But they all ultimately ended up exacerbating my mood issues. I became, essentially, a very energized but thoroughly depressed person!

I'm not trying Wellburtin and my psych seems on board with *my* theory which is that I'm basically just depressed and that my depression manifests primarily with symptoms that look a lot like ADHD, especially having a hard time concentrating.

I'm about to start Wellburtin but am curious as to how commonly ADHD stims are used for depressives who have a hard time getting going and/or concentrating but don't necessarily have ADHD.",1,
" \[30F\] I have been on Lexapro for over a year now, I was having major panic attacks, couldn't focus, in a constant state of miserable anxiety. One day it all came to a head and I went to an urgent care because I was having a terrible panic attack and didn't know what to do. The next day I got an appointment with a psychiatrist and he initially prescribed me lexapro 10 mg and 5 mg of Focalin XR. 

I completely turned around in a couple weeks I was happier than I have been in a long time, could focus, NO ANXIETY (I was absolutely SHOCKED). However my Focalin was not covered by insurance and was extremely expensive so he switched me to 5 mg IR Focalin twice a day. Once I made that switch I have never been able to get to that spot I was initially of happy.

We have played with my medication quite a bit because I continue to have focus/memory problems and I am currently on 10 mg Lexapro 20 XR and 10 mg IR Focalin. 

I do not have any anxiety which is GREAT but I am extremely lathargic, I can't get out of bed, so tired, never want to leave my apartment which is so unlike me. I can't tell if this is a side affect of the lexapro because I feel as though I was like this prior to taking medication due to my anxiety/depression. The absolute worst thing is I have gained 20 lbs since taking my medication without changing anything in my diet/exercise. I was absolutely desperate to lose weight that I hired a personal trainer three months ago and I STILL continue to gain weight (I have been working out 6-7 days a week). I tried (with direction from my psychiatrist) to ween off of Lexapro but my anxiety creeped back so that was not an option.

My psychiatrist decided it was time to switch my Lexapro to 20 mg Prozac which I started two days ago. Has anyone had a similar experience? I'm SO tired of have no energy (despite working out). I am hoping and praying this medication switch will help with the weight gain and energy issue. I struggle to understand how an antidepressant can cause that much weight gain without an other changes to diet and exercise. Any comments/advice/experiences/thoughts you have would be extremely helpful!!",1,

"Been suffering from recurring major depressive disorder for about 7 years. Have tried Wellbutrin 3 times once up to 450mg, each time being extremely challenging in terms of side effects including anger, mood swings, insomnia, excessive stimulation and worsened negative thinking/rumination that persisted for a month or more after dose increases with no clear benefit. Also found stopping cold turkey from Wellbutrin caused awful mood swings. It was basically hell in retrospect, worsening my depression, and disrupting my life further.

Once tried lexapro in combination with wellbutrin, but was having sexual sides at 7.5mg and dating a new girl, so weaned off of that. Tried Cymbalta another time, and was having sexual sides before reaching a therapeutic dose, felt no benefit, and quit that. Also tried adderall (worked OK but made my eyes so red and dry I had to stop) and Concerta which made me feel like hell coming down.

Have tried multiple other modes of treatment: mindfulness, CBT, therapy, light therapy, ruling out sleep apnea.

Desperately wanted to avoid SSRIs as I was afraid of sexual sides, but finally decided to take the plunge again and if I get troublesome side effects I'll deal with it. Started zoloft last week (also reduced wellbutrin from 300mg to 150mg) as I understand it is one of the most effective SSRIs and one of the most 'activating', which appeals to me. Took 25mg for 4 days and 50mg for 4 days. Side effects absolutely pale in comparison to Hellbutrin for me. They initially included minor nausea and minor insomnia (5-7 hours sleep instead of 8-9), but those have already reduced to easily manageable levels in one week. Actually slept about 9 hours last night after waking briefly late in the am. May have slightly reduced genital sensitivity but I also understand that can potentially resolve in time. 

This week has already been subtly better on the whole, I actually accomplished a couple things and have noticed moments of calm, motivation, and positive outlook. Currently praying that zoloft will resolve my depression in the coming weeks without too many side effects.",1,"anger, mood swings, insomnia, stimulation, worsened negative thinking / rumination, swings, nausea, insomnia"

"Hi! I started slowly taking Lamotrigine about a month and a half ago and upped it to 100mg last Wednesday. I was only able to take it for two days as I visited my friend from Saturday through Tuesday and forgot my prescription at home. 

I started taking the 100mg of Lamotrigine again yesterday as well as 36 mg of concerta (first time taking it, I switched over from Vyvanse). I’ve also been taking Bactrim for a UTI 🙃 the past few days but that gave me no side effects. I felt fine yesterday except a little bit of chest ache and a stomachache, (those huge pills are no joke) but for the past few hours today my chest/body has been feeling like it’s in panic attack mode even though my brain feels fine. 

I feel like my there’s a pulse in my chest that’s constantly beating and a soreness when it’s not. I keep having to deep breathe through my mouth when I’m moving to make me feel better but when I do I feel like my chest is like a tightly wound up spring and can’t get loose. 

Was it a mistake to hop back into Lamotrigine after not using it for a few days and is there anything I can do to alleviate these symptoms? I heard that your body can wean off by then and that starting a 100mg dose for the first time cold turkey could possibly kill you.

"Starting with the medication, I feel like it hasn't really helped at all and that there is some very slight social anxiety. I've been taking it since August 2020, and I've still not noticed my mood or energy rising like most report. I know that it varies from person to person, so I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions to what I should do (lowering my dosage, adding a different medi, etc)? I am looking for a combo with bupropion with any other antidepressant that specifically is for treating depression (and slight ADHD?). I can't ask a psych this because 1 I don't have one and 2 I can't get one.

Also, this morning I think (?) I was dreaming, and something happened where it felt like a seizure? Although I woke up after that and I wasn't completely sure. It felt so real, my heart was beating very hard and then my vision turned black and I remember it all throughout being a very unpleasant and hurtful experience. I remember the first part of it but memory formation / the dream had slowly faded it seemed like. 

this morning my heart was beating very hard, not fast but hard, then either my vision blacked out or I shut my eyes, and I had a very unpleasant shaking experience that hurt. I remembered yelling or trying to make some noise so someone would come, and I don't remember anything after that. BUT, I can't discern that experience from real-life and a dream. I woke up again after that, I think feeling fine?

Reasons I think it wasn't : while having a seizure, your brain just has a random burst of electrical activity, so during that time you wouldn't be able to form memories, meaning that moment in time I shouldn't have remembered that : 1 it occurred 2 what it felt like during 3 the fact that I was able to think to yell during it 4 your heart doesn't beat hard, but it beats fast before a seizure, mine was clearly beating extremely hard. 

Reasons I think it was : it felt so realistic, and all throughout the day I was extremely tired, and my memory was foggy, which are symptoms. I also just felt weird 

And I found that after, I wasnt able to differentiate it from a dream, which could be because bupropion is known to cause vivid and lucid dreamstates. Does it sound like I have had a seizure, or -is it the fact that I remember what happened and remember thinking to yell so others can hear me- that proves it was not a seizure?

Thank you all so so much.


Edit: My metabolism is too fast for XR, so a switch to XR wouldn't help. Unless anyone has suggestions on being able to fully digest the XR?

"Keep in mind I must be off my Wellbutrin for about 3 weeks now and my doc says it shouldn't even be in my system anymore. I'd only been on it for a few months, maybe 4 cause of the side effects going from zilch to pretty bad and then fluctuating as I increased my dose to try and negate them.

Just thought I'd try here cause I'm fuckin lost. I'm always so tired I could sleep an entire day while unable to sleep without weed at night (never had that before in my life and I'm a daily smoker). I'm 19M, it doesn't matter if I slept all day or worked all day, sleep at night stays very difficult. Although if I get super tired for no reason I get a bit of light sleep, a couple hours at most and I'm usually an EXTREMELY deep sleeper when I get as tired as I've been getting. Honestly, if I could sleep at all it'd be hard to wake me up unless it was a nap maybe. 

Just feel like I need something and the modafinil and concerta my doc prescribed alleviated the tiredness a bit but I could literally sleep on 100mg Moda and 36mg of concerta right after it kicked in!!! Keep in mind I'm a guy who's found Adderall no more effective (in the past) cause I'm only 130 pounds so stimulants naturally affect me.

If I take some time off coffee then that'll be the only thing that wakes me up although not without even worse body temperature regulation and a shit ton of unneeded anxiety (although thank fuck I'm not in highschool anymore cause it's not so bad now 😆) 

My hands are literally sweating from holding my phone and making this post although I've had no stimulants today and only one coffee which has already long since worn off. That's also extremely unusual btw. My acid reflux still seems kinda fucked although I'll accept that with the amount of stimulants I've been trying for the drowsiness. I know I'm in a low percentile for Wellbutrin to make me drowsy but by the time I was sleeping all day some days from mood and the medication I'd decided I need to get off it.

The good news is i don't need to try a new antidepressant right now cause I'm doing much better mood-wise!! Just wish I could work consistent hours on the farm with my uncle to show my appreciation for letting me stay with them :/ I'll use this post for my next convo with my doc btw.

Honestly just wondering if anyone has any advice or tips on medication to try. I'd usually agree with people Reddit isn't the answer but my nurse mom and family doc don't know what the fuck is going on and sadly it seems consistent with the lower percentile weird side effects. Just really wanna feel normal and not muddled, zoned out and shitty all damn day. Literally considering Adderall or Vyvanse since people say their stronger stimulants... I can't stand waiting these effects out much longer considering I've been dealing with it since my half way point with Wellbutrin and it's extremely discouraging to be doing so little compared to others around here. 

I really am doing okay, not here for consolation but rather any tips/personal experience which may come in handy, literally considering microdosing mushrooms (I got legal RC) since nothing else works and I can't risk other antidepressant side effects.",1,##d
"Im genuinely certain i took my cymbalta yesterday but around 8pm today, which is far before when I usually take my medicine, I started experiencing withdrawal symptoms (head pressure, brain zaps, uncoordinated, weakness). I’m having around maybe 15 to 20 brain zaps per minute now and I just now took my medicine early hoping to stop these side effects. Throughout both today and yesterday I’ve also had fatigue/malaise and hyponatremia-ish feelings, which I experienced when first starting cymbalta but which subsided after maybe 2 months.

Edit 2: I've been drinking vitamin water on and off for the past hour and it's gotten better thankfully, down from around 50 brain zaps a minute to getting brain zaps only if I move. Either tonight's dosage kicked in or the vitamin water helped a lot.

"Hello everyone I’ve been so stressed and anxious the last few days so I guess I’ll try to lay out the whole story.

The past few months starting around thanks giving I was having a little more anxiety than usual which I chalked up to lack of sleep and drinking a little more than usual. It wasn’t anything too terrible up until New Year’s Day on which I had a panic attack.

I was definitely more on edge after that point and was very concerned about any little chest pain or odd feeling which was giving me insomnia. After a week or so of this I went to my Dr. who prescribed me Lexapro for the anxiety and Trazadone for sleep. I took the trazadone first and slept a bit better but still not very great and had some very bad hangover effects like mental fog and being extremely tired the next day.

This caused me to start looking up side effects of both of the pills I was prescribed with kind of obsessively which I have done in the past with other health concerns. This actually put me off of taking the lexapro due to the side effect of increased anxiety and the big one! Suicidal thoughts. I already had a negative impression of SSRIs etc mostly from friends saying negative things about them and you should always push through without them they can change you etc.

About 3 days ago I decided fuck it I’ll just take the lexapro to get to feeling better. Keep in mind my anxiety was pretty bad at this point but nothing absolutely terrible.

I took the pill in the morning and didn’t have any major side effects other than drowsiness. Later on that evening I starting thinking to myself well that wasn’t so bad no nausea, not really any more anxious, no suicidal thoughts. Boom. As soon as I thought that I just got so much anxiety and the feeling of dread that goes with it. I couldn’t stop thinking well what if I do get them which has been distressing me so badly. Trying to keep these thoughts out of my head is making me have intrusive thoughts of it like a fleeting image of actually doing it. Keep it mind I DO NOT want to do this and the thoughts and even the thoughts of maybe having the thoughts is very distressing to me.

I tried to talk to my Dr. about this and was only able to talk to the receptionist and she relayed it to him who then relayed it to her (which I found very odd) to keep taking the pills they’re safe and I will eventually feel better.

I should note I did it take lexapro like 5 years back alongside concerta for ADD. I didn’t take it very long maybe a few weeks and not consistently I missed I few doses etc because I really didn’t understand how it worked at the time. I don’t recall any side effects other than the ones from the stimulant.

So I don’t know guys really long post wanted to get it off my chest and some advice. Should I keep taking this? Go to therapy or maybe even the hospital?

Thanks for reading this long ass post.",1,mental
"I've been on cymbalta for a few months and for the first couple my experience with the medicine was very bad, (lethargy, delirium, low blood pressure, hypoatremia, blood after wiping). But around the beginning of April or so I got this amazing spark of both motivation and new found purpose, which first cycled like rapid hypomania, but then stablized very nicely. I got a lot of stuff done.

 Now however I feel that I'm a small bit less motivated, and that the hypoatremia is definitely coming back. I'm definitely not getting as much stuff done as I want to. Having seen cymbalta's withdrawal side effects, I feel like a decision as to whether I must switch medicines or not needs to be made immediately. I'm going to college in just a few months and I have a lot of stuff planned for both the summer and fall, so I'm afraid withdrawal will leave me both functionally useless and without an antidepressant to better my mood come school. My only real problem with the medicine right now is the hypoatremia/bodily weakness, which interferes with my productivity but not really my mood. The possibility of not finding an effective antidepressant before school starts, be it I switch medicines, scares me a lot, but I'm afraid staying on cymbalta might hinder my potential. I'm not sure if switching medications would be a good decision or not, which is why ask here. It would absolutely be great if someone commented.

Some background information: before, and for a while on cymbalta, I was effectively a mess. I did self harm, was suicidal, didn't really get out of bed or do anything, and my mood was horrible. I'm not sure if it was cymbalta that helped me, or circumstances surrounding college admissions and a change in mindset that did. Perhaps it was cymbalta that caused the latter most or something. I'm just not sure. I reiterate, I'm afraid dropping cymbalta will return me to that state, especially if my new antidepressant happens to be ineffective. For reference I take 20mg prozac (which I should have weaned off of, but abstain from doing so because after trying to, I first experienced hypoatremic symptoms again), 1.5mg of risperidone, 120mg of cymbalta, and 36mg of concerta (new medicine for focus/motivation, though I'm not sure it's working). Any comments would be appreciated. Thank you",1,"lethargy, delirium, low blood pressure, hypoatremia, blood after wiping, hypoatremia, hypoatremia, bodily weakness, atremic symptoms"
"3 years ago, when I was 17, I was on treatment with meds alongside with therapy for almost a year. I had a motor tic triggered by an emotional trauma, also OCD and severe anxiety (these two still present). I was on Prozac, low dose Risperdal, then switched to low dose Abilify and they all helped, my tic disappeared and also improved my obsessions and depression. However, one day I thought all of these were useless and I was feeling bored/depressed as hell, so I decided to cold turkey quit the meds and all the treatment and took recreational stimulants (ecstasy) that night which was probably the most stupid idea. And I kept taking them, even if it was rarely (1-2 times in a year)

Now, after being able to make the decision to avoid any kind of recreational drug, I returned to the treatment (therapy and meds), for disturbing and unreasonable mood swings during the day (they're not new, however, it feels like I can finally describe it), for paranoid thoughts about people that are close to me, the thoughts come and go. One day I'd feel ""so painfully"" unsatisfied, depressed and empty, but when it goes away, I can't even recall those painful negative emotions and think that maybe I don't have any problem and ask myself why I am taking all those meds. Also I have ADD, which I'm guessing my childhood hyperactivity turned into.


Anyway, sorry for the long story. It's been 2 weeks since I got prescribed:


**Effexor (75 mg) (was told to take 37.5 mg for the first 10 days)**


**Sulpiride (lowest dose, 50 mg) (known as Dogmatil, mainly in Europe, an anti-psychotic which is told to have a more stimulating and anti-anxiety effect in low doses, instead of sedative anti-psychotic effects in high doses)**


**Concerta (18 mg)**


**Inderal (beta-blocker, Propranolol) (20 mg, 2 times a day)**


**Also Ativan in case of ""extremely"" difficult times. (I'm really committed to the therapeutic dose with benzos, I've experienced how emotionally destructive they can be, and they just save the specific moment.)**


My psychiatrist is very experienced and offers a very beneficial therapy, so I can say that I trust him and I enjoy our sessions. When I asked him about the combination of Concerta and Sulpiride, he said it's safe. But their mechanisms counteract with each other, and also I've been reading a lot about people taking antipsychotics then developing Tardive Dyskinesia or any kind of permanent movement disorders. So now, I'm kind of obsessed with it, constantly reading scientific articles etc.. My doc says those extra-pyramidal side effects were seen so common with some typical antipsychotics, and in really high doses, but that I shouldn't really have a concern about it since it's an atypical and it's a really low dose. 

I don't experience psychosis by the way. The anti-psychotic was prescribed for helping with the mood swings, anxiety and some obsessive-paranoid thinking.

But as I used to use recreational stimulants, I worry about maybe my brain is damaged and I might be very vulnerable develop those rare side effects? Also, I'd like to get some comments with the Concerta-antipsychotic combination, or the whole drug combination? 

By the way, Concerta and possibly Effexor made me feel switching between disturbingly euphoric-dysphoric for the first few days, but after that, I just turned into a normal, functioning person (things like doing my tasks, feeling motivated enough to get out of home to school etc.), no notable euphoria.

As for side effects, I notice those little muscle twitches in my legs, mainly my left leg. No pain or something but it's just feeling tiny muscles clicking. I was experiencing this before the meds, and many people probably do, but was not so common like this. Could it be a serious adverse effect, or just anxiety or dehydration? My doc says it's fine, need to give some more time. 

Also, I feel more tired/lazy compared to the first week of starting to the medication. It could be effexor kicking in maybe.

I'm looking forward for your opinions.

"Hello all. I've been off and on Wellbutrin for the last couple years. Prescribed originally for ADHD and added Focalin when it ended up not helping all that well. I Kept taking Wellbutrin because I've had trouble coming off of it. Flu like symptoms, stomach discomfort, not to mention the headaches. I fortunately have gone from 300 to 150 successfully and I'm hoping to try coming off of it again. Anyway, I switched from Focalin to Concerta and I've been experiencing back stiffness. I don't know if it's related, but it's starting to really bother me. I also don't feel right. It's hard to describe. I just feel uneasy. Not anxious per se, but like something is off. I don't get a lot of enjoyment from things, I feel awake yet tired, my face feels heavy, etc. I don't know if it's the Concerta or the Wellbutrin. Is anyone else on this combination? How long do withdrawal effects last? Anyone experience this on Concerta alone? I'm thinking about switching back to Focalin when I talk to my doctor on Friday, but I would like to get some additional insight into what might be going on. I didn't experience as many problems on Wellbutrin+Focalin, just Wellbutrin+Concerta",1,"flu like symptoms, stomach discomfort, headache, back stiffness"
"Does DRI with a long half-life have any positive downstream effects on cognition (or mental illness)? We know that SSRI such as Lexapro takes 4 weeks to show its therapeutic effects due to the desensitisation of 5-HT1A/2A receptors. And NRI such as Strattera takes 4 weeks of daily use to show its therapeutic effects due to neuroadaptation, desensitisation of adrenergic receptors and increased firing rate of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. 

But what about DRI with a long half-life such as vyvanse, concerta or modafinil? Do they have any downstream effects and if so what kind of therapeutic effects does it produce?",1,"desensitisation of, neuroadaptation, desensitisation of adrenergic receptors, increased firing rate of dopamine"

Never smoked but one parent was a chain smoker, drink once or twice a year, and even then only a unit or two. No drug use. All heart/breathing issues predate both testosterone and Concerta. 

I had some arrhythmia, flagged with a potential branch bundle block, on a recent ECG taken prior to starting Concerta. I also have breathing difficulties that have been presumed asthma, but with negative spirometry and no wheezing, but I've long suspected maybe heart related.

Regardless, my Salbutamol inhaler makes breathing easier when I'm struggling and helps the headaches I get at the same time. Alleviating the heavy chest feeling I have. Counter to the common side effects, it lowers my heart rate, and seems to stabilise it, either from fast and what feels irregular/fluttery or on other occasions extremely heavy, but also irregular. 

I've recently been titrated to Concerta 54mg and have been on this dose for less than two weeks. In this time my blood pressure has lowered from being on the cusp high blood pressure to around 105/73, and on a couple of occasions 96/66. My resting pulse at night is around 50-55bpm, so higher than the 45-46bpm common before, though it seems the same during the day (71ish)and seems to fluctuate less, no longer suddenly jumping high for no reason.  I've also suddenly needed my inhaler less. 

I know this is a strange thought, but both the Salbutamol and Concerta are supposed to elevate heart rate and blood pressure, but are seemingly doing the opposite. Is it possible that the medications are causing a reaction in my heart that is correcting the arrhythmia, making it easier for my body to function?",1,"arrhythmia, branch bundle block"
"Hi, I‘m a 19 y/o trans woman, 6 months on HRT (10 mg Cyproterone Acetate and 3 mg Estrogel daily) and I‘m 170cm (5ft7) tall and weigh around 55kg (122lbs). I‘m diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder, ADHD combined type, ASD and gender dysphoria.

My ADHD diagnosis is fairly new (got it in the beginning of September, so last month), however I‘ve been in therapy for depression for much longer (since June 2020). I tried Sertraline and Vortioxetine in the past but they both didn‘t do anything. As a result of that I had genetic testing done which showed I was an ultra-rapid metabolizer through CYP2C19 which apparently more or less excludes me from treatment with many antidepressants, including (Es-)citalopram. Anyway, I was unmedicated for a while and saw a new psychiatrist on September 22nd. We discussed some options and at the end I was prescribed 30mg Duloxetine (Cymbalta) (was told to increase it to 60 after 2 weeks) and 18mg Methylphenidate (generic Methylphenidate XR tablets) for my depression and ADHD. I actually asked the doc if it was safe as they are both Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors but he said as long as you keep an eye on it, it‘s fine. 

However, I actually went to a psych ward the following week where I‘m in stationary treatment now. They took me off of Methylphenidate as they wanted to know which med my side effects (being anxious, agitated and dizzy) came from. They told me they planned to put me back on my ADHD meds after a while though as I told them that treating my ADHD is important for me. The side effects went away and they increased my Duloxetine dose to 60mg on September 30th. Last Friday however they came back to me and told me they had „read into it some more“ and combining Duloxetine and Methylphenidate was apparently dangerous after all so I had to drop Duloxetine to restart ADHD treatment and apologized for „not knowing earlier“. Weird thing is, they suggested Wellbutrin as an alternative which the psychiatrist before the clinic excluded as an option because of the high interaction potential. Regardless, they immediately ended my prescription for Duloxetine and I‘m supposed to start Concerta tomorrow which I‘m happy about but still, I‘d like to have sth against my depression too maybe and it just seems really strange that opinions vary this much. So I wanted to ask here. Is it really dangerous to combine these two meds? And how would Wellbutrin be any safer than Cymbalta? I mean it also increases the availability of Noradrenaline (like Cymbalta) AND Dopamine on top (unlike Cymbalta). Wouldn‘t that interfere with Methylphenidate even more? 

I haven‘t really been able to talk about this with the doc as he is on vacation rn. Anyway, sorry for being rambly, I hope I‘m making sense, I‘m just a bit frustrated with whom to trust and whom not.

"24F, 5'9"", around 140lbs. 

Preexisting medical issues: Long Covid (now mostly recovered), restrictive eating disorders (been in recovery for a few years, made a lot of progress these past 6 months which has increased my weight to healthy levels), mild asthma, ADHD

Current medications: 18mg Concerta, multivitamins, one single dosage of CBD oil over a week ago (first dosage, haven't continued it yet)

I've never had problems with Concerta before now (I've been off and on it since late 2019), except for depressed mood during the crash (when it wears off). Since August, I've been taking it very irregularly (like one pill every other month, or one pill every day for a week and then off again), because I've gotten better at managing my symptoms & I wanted to avoid the depressed mood during crashes & I was scared of building tolerance. So I've just been taking it as needed.

On Tuesday, I began taking it again. I felt weird that day, and then realized I was having those ""zombie-like"" symptoms that I've heard people describe when their stimulant dosage is too high. On Wednesday, I was experiencing irritability and moodswings, and some insomnia. Today, I had a lot of heart palpitations (especially after the drug wore off), and was coughing at one point, including a couple dry coughs (which I started having after getting covid in 2020, but they've been a rare occurrence these past 6 months). And insomnia. The insomnia is really bad right now.

I know I'm very ""light-weight"" when it comes to any sort of drug (prescribed, as well as alcohol which I drink rarely, and an edible which I had once and then never again). But it's weird that I'm suddenly experiencing symptoms of my 18mg dosage being too high - it's the lowest concerta dosage possible, and it's always worked very well for me before.

I read somewhere that irregular intake of low dosages of methylphenidate can cause sensitization to the drug, but since the article was pretty long and complex, I'm not sure if I understood it correctly. I want to keep taking it because I don't want the sensitization to get worse (if that is in fact what's happening), but the heart palpitations today made me worried.

Is it safe to keep taking it? Why is this happening?

I’m just starting concerta for ADHD and on day 2 of 18mg (plan is to up the dose every week for 4weeks to trial which dosage works best). Since starting, I’ve been having some mild chest pain. It’s definitely not like terrible or emergency worthy and doesn’t last long, it feels closer to when you go on a run and get a “stitch” in your heart or like mild precordial catch pain. I have heard of chest pain as a side effect of concerta but when I look it up it’s mostly talking about emergency worthy chest pain.

Im tapering and on 0.5mg of suboxone, and claritin when needed (practically daily now). No additional/illegal substances (maybe half to one Monster a day in caffeine). Multivitamin and B-complex daily. Im also a smoker, 3/4 pack a day. Just restarted 54mg concerta (Methylphenidate ER)

Edit: antihistamines have a tendency to amp my body up as well too. For example, pepcid (Famotidine), even at like 10mg in the morning, will mess with my sleep. Ill wake up after like 4 or 5 hours with crazy dreams. Hydroxyzine, which Im prescribed 25mg (only take a quarter if I need it) but barely take, causes similar issues. I understand this is kinda rare, but it runs in my family.

So, ill keep this story as concise as possible. 

Started concerta journey, idk, a lil over a year ago? ADHD diagnosis for 2 years, tried some non stimulants beforehand. Titrated up from 18mg to 54mg over that time, was stable on 54mg for 4 or 5 months or so?

I start having constant with random spikes to Angioedema allergic reactions, and I had to stop taking the concerta for about 4 months (the script I had made it worse for some reason, but I was told it shouldnt from the allergist, and now restarting with no allergic adverse effects). 

Now the allergies are getting under control (tested positive for everything but food, every mold, tree, dust, cats and dogs etc. Starting allergy shots, some people think the Covid vaccine caused this, which 2nd Moderna shot was May15th, this started first week in July. No booster shot yet)

Talk to doctor, he prescribes me the 54mg again. I asked if we should titrate back up, he says thats only to determine the right dose, and there isnt much of a tolerance thing at play, so I can restart same dose. I was skeptical but I did it anyways 

Im having more side effects than usual.

1 morning,  take dose about 930-10am, slightly uptight and anxious (im not an anxious person normally unless im super hyped up)

After like 2pm, get tired. Not like, over stimulated tired, but legit, imma take a nap tired.

After like 5 or 6, get a super burst of anxious energy until maybe 830. My mind is slowed but my body is super tense and anxious, and its paralyzing. I feel like an anxious mess that cant move to release the energy.

2. My muscles on my right side, slightly in chest, neck muscle on right side, running up past my jawline, and my cheek and jawline, get tight and kinda numb? 
Ive had this randomly before while taking Concerta. I was told its prob from working from home and a sedentary lifestyle, that its just tight muscles, CT scan showed no abnormalities in blood vessels. Was prescribed baclofen which kinda helped, but messed with concerta I think. I do have some Baclofen left if thats an option
But now its happening as soon as I started concerta again, and it hasnt gone away really, unless my dose has worn off.

3. I have less thoughts overall, but Ill get stuck with 1 thought in a sort of loop, over and over, like hyperfixated on it.

4 ofc a decreased appetite, and dry mouth, which is expected for me.

5. Circulation issues. Hands and feet are cold always, and my penis doesnt get enough blood to it. Itll have like an hourglass shape, blood in the base, and blood in the tip, like its struggling to get blood going. I noticed this before when I was on it, but wasnt ever sure what the correlation was. My actual libido isnt changed, but the physical aspect is drastically worse. 

Im trying to get out of the house more and burn the energy, walks and such, be social etc, but it doesnt make much of a difference.

I guess what Im asking is, is this too high of a dose right now? Should I keep taking it and getting used to it, or ask for like, a 27+18mg dose after the holidays and work back up to it? Or stop taking it temporarily?

The evenings are the absolute worst, im paralyzed from my body having too much energy/anxiety, and I cant move to get it out, and I have those tight/numbish muscles that semi freak me out. 

I know it has a 3 part delivery system, which makes sense for my different reactions at different times, but this is also the first time ive experienced it at this extreme. 

Any ideas/similar storues/advice? Thank you in advance 😊",1,"angioedema allergic reactions, decreased appetite, dry mouth"

My stomach also felt like it was being flipped upside down, and I initially mistook the dizziness and stomach feeling for flushness and nausea, thinking I was about to suddenly throw up (which has been happening to me periodically for a few weeks without explanation). However, I noticed that I didn't have any increased salivation which is usually the way I know that I need to vomit near immediately. That was when it clicked for me that it wasn't normal sickness. I couldn't really form precise thoughts well, and I felt like I was detached from my body. However, I could still generally communicate (which mostly consisted of a lot of anxious noises and ""I really don't feel good."" or ""Something doesn't feel right.""). I was able to slowly walk a few feet to grab my water bottle with my right hand (since it wasn't affected) and then take a drink from it, hoping it would help calm my body down. I sat on the bed in silence for about a minute, trying to take deep breaths, before the feelings faded. I was initially terrified that I had a stroke or TIA. After the feelings faded, my left arm still felt quite sore (which lasted about an hour), and I was suddenly *dead* exhausted followed with an extremely mild headache. I had at least some energy left for the evening prior to the event, but it felt like it was drained from me immediately after. All I wanted to do was sleep right after it happened, but I was too frazzled by the event to do so. The only other thing that has concerned me since then is that the extremely mild headache I had still feels like it's there and hasn't gone away. That may just be my anxiety getting to me, though.

My mother was diagnosed with epilepsy about a year ago, but she isn't in any part of my life, so I don't know the exact details of her diagnosis. Not to mention, I've presumed that her epilepsy was caused by her alcohol/tobacco/drug abuse over her lifetime.

Only prior info I can give that might help is that I hadn't eaten really anything that day nor drank any water (which is partly due to my Concerta), but I had eaten and drank water about an hour prior to the event. Likely unrelated, but I've also been having auditory processing issues recently for the past few weeks. 

I've messaged my doctor about it and I'm waiting to hear back. Any info or help understanding what happened and what to do going forwards is greatly appreciated",1,

Tl;dr Have had classic TN affecting the left mandibular branch for 1.5 years, sporadic facial spasms on the same side for ca. 6 months, in the past week I now have near constant spasms and twitching on the same side as the TN and wonder if it's a random coincidence or related and whether it's worth a follow-up. 


Longer version:
I have idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (classic TN with paroxysmal attacks but no nerve compression or other cause found in an MRI) which started about a year and a half ago. It was suggested that I start with carbamazapine but I've held off for now because the side effects scare me and it's been pretty unpleasant but manageable. In the last couple of months though, the attacks have gotten much more frequent (from a few per week to dozens per day on some days). 

I have also had occasional muscle spasms in the area next to my lip and lower part of my left cheek for maybe half a year. Then this past week or so I've started having almost nonstop twitching in the same area, and also a bit higher up, under my eye. It's gotten to be very disruptive. I've had brief bouts of muscle twitching before around my eye, in my bicep and thigh muscle. Those were much milder and short lived though, and it seems like an odd coincidence that my face is losing its **** twitching constantly in the same general area where I know something is screwed up with my trigeminal nerve. It also seems to have progressed in severity. But then again, it also seems like the left side of my body is just a mess. The trigeminal neuralgia, visual disturbances and partial blindness from migraine auras, icepick headaches, tinnitus, neck pain and tense/shortened neck muscles, way worse joint instability in the upper body, even noticeably shorter limbs and digits, and now this face twitching...all on the left side. So I'll readily accept that my left side is just cursed and there's nothing more to it but a weird coincidence.

However, the early-onset TN and now the aggressive twitching is making me anxious that some underlying neurological BS was missed. I believe that MS is one of the things they ruled out but I'm not totally sure. I do not have the neurologist's report in my electronic records (though it should be possible to request it), I was just told by my doctor that *he* was told that everything was normal with the MRI (no reason to doubt that of course, I just don't have any details). I also got blood tests recently (sodium and potassium levels and some tests for kidney and liver function) so I could start taking carbamazapine with less delay if the TN suddenly gets even worse. Everything was normal there too. 

I don't doubt the competence of the individual doctors involved in my healthcare, but the system (in an unnamed European country) can be a little chaotic. I don't have direct access to any kind of specialist in most cases, everything is through my primary care doctor at a healthcare center which has a high staff turnover, and I've had 3 different doctors since the onset of the TN so it's very hard for them, or me, to really have a coherent picture of things and I don't want to add more chaos and bother my doctor with some random symptom unless it might be significant.

"I (25F) found out I was pregnant two days ago and reached out to various local clinics.
My symptoms included missing a period, exhaustion, and mild cramping. I have not bled or spotted. I've also been taking antibiotics (the take 1 twice a day for 5 days kind) for a UTl and, prior to visiting the doctor, hadn't had a normal bowel movement in the last 48 hours (I am now fine). I went for the preliminary counselling and ultrasound the next day but they couldn't find a fetus. I'm around 3 weeks pregnant so they said this is normal. During the internal ultrasound the doctor was pressing around and I had some pain on my lower right side (where I typically experience period pain). She said she was concerned and sent me to the ER. She was concerned that my pregnancy could be ectopic. I was really shocked because I didn't feel ill or like anything was wrong with my body. At the hospital they did bloodwork and ultrasounds.

Like the previous ultrasound, I experienced pain when they were poking around but unlike the last ultrasound, this pain was present anywhere they pressed. They were poking and pressing for about 30 minutes. It sucked. Once the doctor looked over the ultrasound and blood test results she said that all the bloodwork came out
""unremarkable"" and they confirmed I was about 3 weeks pregnant. The ultrasound didn't detect a fetus and they also ruled out any issues with my appendix.
They told me to get a blood test 48 hours later (tomorrow) and that an early pregnancy centre would follow up with an ultrasound during the week.
I mentioned to the doctor that my family booked a repositioning cruise from Vancouver to Hawaii that leaves on the 22nd.
She said that I cannot travel because I wouldn't be able to get medical attention while at sea. She said the only way I can still go is it the next ultrasound shows that the fetus is where it's supposed to be, but that might not be possible since l'm so early into the pregnancy.
I am beside myself because l've been looking forward to this trip for so long. It's a graduation present and l've had a rough go lately. I haven't experienced any cramping or other ectopic symptoms since I've had my bowel movement and I feel like nothing is wrong. Obviously l'm not a doctor and can't make this calls but I feel like they are overreacting. I feel incredibly guilty for potentially ruining a vacation and for something that might not even happen.

Have been having ultrasounds done to follow some cysts in one of my ovaries (left, I’ve never had anything in my right ovary before). This last one that I had, the tech has me freaked out. Asking if my GP has sent for a gyno referral yet, asking about any surgeries (which I would consider a normal question) and when I said that I had exploratory surgery when they had suspected endometriosis she replied with “and they didn’t find anything? How long ago was it?”. It was nearly 20 years ago. When we had finished (she took 91 images! Compared to previous ultrasounds between 30-45) I said that I understood she couldn’t tell me anything about the ultrasounds, I wasn’t asking her to but if I don’t hear from my GPs office the following week, should I be following up? She replied with “mmm, yep! I would be”. I’ve gotten the report back and it noted the following: 

**Findings from November 9 2024 ultrasound:**  
34 y/o F. Hx: 6 MONTH E/U MAY 1 US REGARDING LEFT OVARIAN CYST.  
COMPARISON: May 1, 2024  
FINDINGS:  
Uterus: 7.16 cm length. Positive/normal uterus sliding sign. Unremarkable.  
Endometrium Thickness: 0.49 cm, within normal range for menstrual age/stage.  
Right ovary/Adnexa: New 3 cm hemorrhagic ovary cyst, almost certainly benign. Right ovary volume: 34.60 mL.  
Left Ovary/Adnexa: 4 cm thin walled unilocular anechoic cyst with minimal sessile adherent debris, 3.8 cm (3.3 cm). Left ovary volume:38.42 mL

For comparison's sake...

**Findings from May 1 2024 ultrasound:**   
Right ovary/Adnexa: Unremarkable. Right ovary volume: 1.69 mL.  
Left Ovary/Adnexa: Left ovary volume: 21.95 mL. New 3.3 × 2.8 x 3.7 thin cm bilocular anechoic left ovarian cystic lesion with single internal septation, smooth walls, color score of 1, and no solid component. 7 mm echogenic probable corpus albicans seen previously is not redemonstrated.

I will note that my cycle has been all over the place when it used to be like clockwork - this has been brought up to my GP and is one of the reasons I’m back on birth control. My cycle has been getting shorter (from 28 to 21 days) and in October I had my period twice, seven days apart. It started a third time, seven days after the second ended but was much briefer than the first two, I assume because of the birth control. The first two had moments that were reminiscent of when I had a postpartum hemorrhage. Pain has been minimal but some cramping and feeling bloated. 

I will be following up with my GP and I’ve already seen in the report that there’s to be a follow-up ultrasound from 6 months from now. I guess my question is, is this acceptable and likely the only thing to do? What would your recommendation or course of action be? Should I be pushing for a gyno referral? At what point are these cysts removed?

hi all. i was just a rave in a venue that has no windows and it was very warm in there and i was in a very tightly packed crowd when suddenly i felt my heart beating very fast (150bpm according to fitbit) and then i started to get nauseous and extremely sweaty very fast and felt really uneasy so i ran out of the crowd and with every step i took i felt woozier and woozier and finally i just sat down on the floor and someone escorted me outside. 

my vision had like a perfect graph of black dots in it like all in lines and then it went back to normal. outside i instantly felt a lot better but still not perfect. sat on ground for a while. started to feel better. now i’m going home. i didn’t have anything to drink at the venue, and the only thing i smoked was my own weed vape nothing of anyone else’s (and i only took one hit). is it possible i was drugged despite not drinking anything there and only hitting my vape? if not drugged, then what are the other possibilities? i’m scared i had a heart attack. 

i have never experienced that ever before and while i didn’t totally pass out i felt like i was going to kind of. i’ve never passed out before or came close in my life and ive been to plenty of concerts where i was dancing way harder and felt way hotter. i didn’t feel hot at all until i was suddenly drenched in sweat. i was normal amount of hydrated and i had eaten during the day before the show. i didn’t feel particularly hot until everything started happening so there was no indication of it being heat related but maybe it was? should i go to the hospital? i’m just sleepy now but not woozy or as nauseous. 

it has now been about 3 hours since all this happened and it’s 4am and i just wanna sleep. but i need to know if i should go to the hospital 

edit- i did actually get a drink of water in a cup at the bar for a friend but we stood by the bar and my two friends drank almost the whole cup and i had a TINY sip hardly ANYTHING and they drank all of it and they feel totally fine. so odds of drugging still low",1,
"Hey! I (22M) know that when it comes to things like these, the effects are different for each individual and so. However, I would still hope for some knowledge on general trends for people in my situation.

To put it short:
I used to drink a few times a week (on average) a few years ago. This lasted for about 2 years. Sometimes it was more like being constantly tipsy, and sometimes I drank until intoxication for several days in a row. So it's a bit difficult to ""calculate"", but I pretty much drank until intoxication at least once a week, but usually even more often. At the time I was in my late teens. Around the time just prior to turning 20, I just didn't crave alcohol the way I did before. I spent a couple of years still drinking, but in moderation. The frequency has differed severely depending on the month or time period. But it was still at least a few times every month, and at least a couple of nights were spent full on intoxicated every month. 

Now, last January, I took part in dry January. The mental clarity felt so good, that I kept extending my time. Now we're living in October, and I still haven't had a drop of alcohol. I have decided to carry on until next year on the minimum, since I am this far already. 

I have been considering two possible paths forward:
Either I quit alcohol completely, or I'll allow myself to drink in moderation, but only on special occasions.

However, I am worried about the possible damage I have already caused to my organs. Every health related survey/quiz I have done, that has a question about alcohol consumption, doesn't include the option for having quit heavy drinking. I fear that answering ""no"" corrupts the results since it doesn't take into account all the alcohol that had already been consumed in the past. 

So my questions for you would be:

1. How much damage has my drinking in the past already caused my body (approximately) and overall health?

2. How much of a difference would there be between total abstaining and drinking in moderation and only on special occasions (let's assume 3 - 5 beers once a month)?

3. Is it possible to *totally* reduce/nullify any possible long term effects caused by alcohol? I feel like I could be more prone for other conditions (less ""immune"" in a way).

Some additional information: 
I have been using ADD medication (Concerta 36mg) semi-regularly the past few months too. I had used the medication as a child, but had gone years without it. I keep breaks from the medicine when obligations are less intense.
I also used chewing tobacco for a few years, but I quit it during the summer of 2023.


Again, I know it's very difficult to predict/calculate these things, but I'd be very grateful for any information. I'd really appreciate even further insights on my situation and this topic in general too.

Apologies for not being so good at wording this post. Thank you in advance for answering!",1,
"18M, not sure current height/weight, currently switching from prozac to lexapro, also taking olanzapine 7.5mg, gabapentin 900mg 2x, and concerta 54mg.

when i was younger, i one day noticed that every time i tilt my head to the left i get a click/crunch sound. I ended up getting very anxious about it and had it checked out by my doc, who said it was crepitus, he also gave me a neck x ray for my own peace of mind which came back with no concerns.

It has been years since then, and i still experience this click/crunch. I also have dealt with headaches, often one sided for years. To the point where i was convinced i had a brain tumor and had a CT without contrast on my head which came back ""prestine"" Could this CT being non contrast have missed some vascular issue/cancer/tumor in my brain? or did they not feel the need to use contrast because they were certain? this was at mcmaster childrens hospital in canada. Its a big hospital with a good rep, so should i be okay?

Now to my neck questions,  
since i noticed the clicking and crunching in my neck i since noticed a similar consistent click when i tilt my head back. I dont exactly know when this began. More recently i began worrying about this again because i had discovered this new way to crack my back, where i push my head forward and my shoulders back, and it cracks down my spine. I became worried that doing this had done something to my CSF pressure, hence causing my headaches. I went into the emergency room and spoke to a doctor there and the nurse did some examinations and they said i was fine.

Due to my OCD since then i continued to crack my back in this way, checking to see if things felt different before or after doing it, for example when i would get a headache, i would try and crack it to see if it would fix or relieve the headache, which it never seemed to from what i could tell. A few days ago i woke up with this pain on the left side of my neck, when i turn to that left side. From what i remember i tried cracking my back in that specific way a few times to see if it would fix this pain or to see if maybe something needed to be cracked back into place, and it did not seem to make a difference. It has been a few days since i woke up with this pain, and it has not gone away. however i have been moving my neck to that side quite often compulsively, to check my range of motion on both sides and compare, so maybe i have just irritated it preventing it from healing? or does something really need to be cracked again into place/adjusted?

Since all of this happening, i have noticed that occasionally when i leave my neck alone for a while, when i DO end up tilting it to the left or tilting it back. it makes this loud harsh **SNAP** sound, and its freaking me out, it will snap really loud and even feels like there is some friction inside, like it feels like something snaps inside my neck. This grinding popping and snapping alongside my headaches has me worried about CCI, and about my headaches being intracranial hypertension as a result of something wrong with my neck and CSF, whether its from me cracking for these past few months or what. Im also worried that something was missed in the non contrast CT since it was non contrast. I am horribly anxious and i have no idea what to do as i can not spend a single moment of free time without stressing about this.

Am i going to end up needing surgery? Do i need to do that back cracking movement to correct something and therefore fix the neck pain? is this cervical instability? could these issues with my neck be causing my headaches or intracranial pressure? does the back cracking movement have anything to do with it? ive had the crunch click noise when tilting to the left for years but it doesnt usually make this super loud snap sound every now and then when i leave it for a bit.

"M18, not sure current weight or height, white, currently switching/tapering from prozac to lexapro, also taking gabapentin 900mg 2x daily, 7.5mg olanzapine, and 54mg concerta.

For a few years now, every time i tilt my head to the left i get a crunch sound sometimes its a crunch, sometimes its a click, sometimes its kind of like a combo of the two. More recently i began noticing that every time i tilt my head back i get a click sound.

Sometimes when i dont mess with it for a while, the snap will be louder and harder upon tilting my head, and it worries me.

I saw my family doc about the crunch when i tilt to the left, he said it was nothing and even did an x ray for my peace of mind which came back normal, the problem is. I have been cracking my back and neck a lot since then, and i dont know if i have done more recent damage.

Because of my OCD and anxiety i worry that this is a problem and that there is something wrong with my neck, i get headaches a lot too so i dont know if i have a misalignment of sorts from cracking my back or neck.

I crack my back by pulling my shoulders back and pushing my neck forward, it cracks all the way down my spine, however i recently wokew up with a pain on the left side of my neck, so i stopped cracking my back in that way. (not positive if this pain is from how i slept on it or from the cracking)

I have compulsions to check my neck, by tilting it to the side and by tilting it back. And when i did it today it made a click, and now when i leave it be for a while when i do the movement again the click is harder and louder.

Does anyone know what this is? anyone dealing with something similar? i know i have had the crunching for some time now and within that time got a clean neck x ray, but could my self cracking have made matters worse or caused damage? I want to keep checking it, but every time i do i get the loud \*SNAP\* louder tthan it usually is.

I thought originally that this noise had something to do with my back cracking movements. So i stopped cracking my back and i STILL get the loud snap, it seems to be going away a bit now, but i still have bad anxiety that something is wrong with my neck and that i am going to end up needing surgery, and i am horribly afraid of anesthesia. This clicking and cracking alongside my headaches and the pain i woke up with have me so worried something is seriously off, and i cant relax or enjoy anything.

Will i need surgery for this? is this normal and just caused by me moving my neck too much? Any help is appreciated.",1,

Hello all,

F18 (162cm, 48kgs)

Current meds: Concerta, Wellbutrin (have taken them for a while and minimal side effects) 

Supplements: Vitamin D, Homocysteine control (vitamin b6, folic acid, vitamin b12) 

Diagnoses: Asthma (mild), Only seasonal allergies

Maybe important info: I smoke, had surgery 3ish months ago, and family history of colon cancer (both sides of family) 

Actual post: 
I’ve had a long history of stomach problems - I was told it was acid reflux, IBS, lactose intolerance, food allergies, and anxiety which caused my digestive issues. None of these are true except anxiety lol. 

I recently went to the ER for severe abdominal cramping, constipation, and only ‘pooping’ bloody mucus. I frequently went to the bathroom and the only thing that would come out was bloody mucus. I also was extremely bloated, almost no appetite, brain fog, extreme fatigue, and abdominal cramping that almost felt like my organs were being folded or rearranged. 

While at the ER, I got an X-ray, blood test, urine test, and a fluorescent CT scan. Everything supposedly came back normal except the CT scan. The CT scan apparently showed severe inflammation throughout my entire small intestine and colon. I was then referred to a gastroenterologist the next day. 

Upon meeting the gastroenterologist, he told me my colon wasn’t actually inflamed, and the blood I found in my bowel movements was probably caused by hemorrhoids (which I do not have). As for the inflammation in my small intestine, he diagnosed me with acute enteritis and sent me off with 14 days worth of extremely strong laxatives. He told me the blood and the inflammation were probably not related, and that I had eaten something bad, triggering the inflammation. I’ve not eaten anything out of the ordinary. 

I took the laxatives and they worked a bit too well. I stopped taking them on the 2nd day because I felt like my nausea was worse and could’ve been caused by the laxatives. However, on the 3rd day I started having severe heartburn and the nausea still stayed severe. I’d sit and feel vomit come up, just for it to go down. 

A few days have gone by since then, I am still off the laxatives and my bowel movements are very infrequent. I’ve also lost about 3kgs in a week without intending to. My stomach hurts too much for me to eat anything, as I feel extremely nauseous 24/7. I don’t know what to do because my doctor isn’t taking my situation seriously and there are no other doctors available (they’re all on strike). 

I had really bad food poisoning 4 months ago but got over it after taking antibiotics. I also lost a lot of weight this past year. I used to weigh 64 kgs last year and now weigh 48kgs (wasn’t done in a healthy way). I also used to frequently throw up, get sick, and had stomach issues growing up. 

I apologize for the lengthy post, could someone provide me with some advice or opinions on what this could be please?

"My daughter (14f, 5’1, 97 lbs) was hospitalized with SJS two years ago, triggered by Lamictal.  It was considered a mild case due to very little skin involvement, but she still spent a week in the hospital with blisters on her eyes, lips, mouth, throat, and genitals.  She has several chronic autoimmune conditions including celiac disease, asthma, and psoriasis.  She also has a diagnosis of Bipolar 1 which we believe was triggered by an autoimmune reaction, possibly PANDAS, as her symptoms appeared virtually overnight following several bouts of strep over a five month period when she was 4yo.  All of her other autoimmune conditions presented around the same time.  

Today she tested positive for Flu A.  Her doctor prescribed Tamiflu because her flu symptoms just started today, and because she has a history of getting very sick with flu and secondary pneumonia, even after getting a flu shot.  She has not had the shot yet this year.  She has never taken Tamiflu before.  

Given her history of SJS and other autoimmune reactions, is the Tamiflu worth the risk?

My entire life I've had chronic sleep-onset insomnia (shifts in cycles, I'll have months when I'm fine and months where I don't sleep more than an hour each night, started when I was an infant and is hereditary with my grandma also having it) and have always been a night person. But all of a sudden, I'm now a morning person. I thought it would settle itself but 2 years later and I'm shifting into another cycle of insomnia that I didn't immediately recognise because it's reversed. Instead of not falling asleep till 5, I'm waking up at 2 or 3 am and being unable to fall asleep again (although I don't let myself get out of bed until the ""socially acceptable"" 5am). 

My question is why? This feels very drastic and it's not the first time I'd been unable to get my meds for a period of time - nothing was different! But yet the reaction to it was extreme and has flipped a schedule I've had my entire life on its head. When I told my GP, she gave me a very confused look - I hadn't originally brought it up because I thought it was within the realm of possible side effects. Now I think different and as I've been waking up earlier and earlier, I'm worried my body is winding itself back to normal and I'll end up nocturnal for a period of time (I know, over exaggerated, but anxiety makes you think some silly things). Is this normal?

"Hello all! 

Absolutely coming to this thread to see if anyone can put my symptoms together into something or if somehow I genuinely have a variety of issues that are separate. 

The biggest thing that started in 2019 was something my doctor called intensive hipnic jerks - so what happens is that in my sleep I wake up from that “falling feeling” but it’s extremely intense and comes with an immediate panic attack. From that point onward, I’m very disoriented, hyperventilating, anxious etc and every time I close my eyes it will start all over again. The worst case of this I was awake for four days and having hallucinations from sleep deprivation. This has continued on until present with very little solutions found - currently diagnosed with a panic disorder because of it. It only happens in my sleep or with my really bad migraines. It also has daytime anxiety for all the days it follows until it subsides. 

In addition to that, I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Asthma, I’ve had migraines since I was 10 (anywhere from 2 hours to the longest one being 13 days). I’ve been diagnosed with IBS and Interstitial Cystitis as well. I very regularly have pretty extreme bloating and never have regular *number twos* unless I take medication for it. This also usually comes with pretty painful abdominal pain. I do also experience pelvic pain most months. I have also been diagnosed as hypermobile in almost all of my joints and I wonder how much is connected to that. My doctor does say I have extra sensitive nerves and very regularly have whole limbs go to sleep very easily, including my right leg not working when my back pain flared up. The back pain theory so far is a slipped disk - xray booked for that  I also very regularly have nightmares and used to have nightmares terrors from age two onward. I’m 29, white female, currently taking:

- Sertraline - 75 mg daily
- Hydroxyzine - 25-125 mg as needed for sleep and anxiety 
- Concerta - 27 mg for ADHD 
- Vitamin D supplement 
- Magnesium supplement 
- L-theanine as needed 
- Lorazepam 1mg as needed 
- Botox for migraines (hasn’t helped) 

I’m a registered psychotherapist myself, so as far as therapies go, I’ve tried talk therapy, CBT, ACT, DBT skills, EMDR, IFS parts work, somatic work, and I’m about to try Neurofeedback therapy. I’ve tried physio, acupuncture, massages, lidocaine injections, breast reduction surgery, Botox for migraines and in trap muscles, a whole host of migraine medications. 

I’ve had the following tests done in the past 5 years and all came back normal unless stated otherwise. 

- Echocardiogram
- ECG 
- EKG
- Extensive testing with internal medicine
- two week holter monitor 
- blood work of almost every type (about to do more)
- celiac test was negative 
- inflammation markers are normal
- Thyroid seems to be normal 
- CT scan was normal
- Sleep study came back normal (we were unable to catch the hypnic jerks on the study)
- had a gastrointestinal specialist 
- epilepsy and seizures testing 

I regularly work out with a blend of weight lifting, cardio, and HIIT. My doctor says my weight and eating is fine! None of my symptoms have ever seemingly been connected to weight or lifestyle in particular. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I sometimes have some THC and CBD drinks for pain. I am so open to ANY ideas - it has been years of testing with so little answers and it just feels wild to think at least some of them are connected. Happy to answer any questions!! I really appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and any suggestions you may have!

"45F, began treatment for general anxiety disorder & ADHD 6 months ago. First 2 months only trying ssri meds to find right one. Landed on Prozac 10mg but still had anxiety attacks periodically. Then started trying ADHD meds, landed on Concerta ER 18mg. With the attacks still happening & sleep issues was put on 1mg Clonazapam at bedtime. So: morning is Prozac & Concerta. Bedtime Clonazapam. 

First week was great, but over the last couple of weeks starting in the afternoon I have started a downward spiral craving alcohol & cigarettes to an alarming degree along with anger, hopelessness, and bad anxiety. One night I drank a bottle of whiskey & smoked 2 packs of cigarettes. It scared and confused me so I through everything out I had in the house. But every afternoon the spiral starts and I feel like I’m going bonkers and just want to binge drink & smoke. I don’t, so I just keep calling friends and talking until I fall asleep. 
In the morning I’m 100% fine. Happy, zero cravings, motivated…me again. 

History: abused alcohol & smoked until 5 years ago, quit both cold turkey for 3 years. Began doing both again very moderately a couple of years ago. As in a few drinks every 6 weeks and a couple of cigarettes a week. Sometimes I wouldn’t smoke for weeks. 

*side bar had non copper IUD inserted 3 months ago as well

Confused as nothing like this happened until the Clonazapam was introduced? The last 6 months of trying different meds and didn’t feel this way. ",1,"anxiety attacks, sleep"
"34f, 5’9, 185 lbs

Levothyroxine, calcitriol, vitamin d, calcium, concerta, bupropion. I have hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism from a thyroidectomy in 2021. 

I got my thyroidectomy because of thyroid cancer. I picked my surgeon. He told me he does the most thyroidectomies in my province. (He seems like a big deal honestly and trains a lot of surgeons). A month before I had my surgery he called me and went over the possible complications. He said “another risk is permanent Hypoparathyroidism but you have 4 parathyroids and only need 1. In my 35 years I’ve only had 1 patient with permanent hypopara”. He also talked to me about it before my surgery and I signed off knowing it was a possibility. I didn’t think much of it. 

I wake up from my surgery and the resident tells me that the cancer was in my lymph nodes in my neck which didn’t show up on any scans previously so they were surprised. (The lymph nodes were actually larger than my 2 thyroid nodules) So I also got a central neck dissection. When I woke up I was put on calcium and calcitriol. No one explained why. I had one of the worst nights of my life in the hospital that night. My legs were tingling so bad I was crying. Felt like my legs were going to burn off. I didn’t know what was causing it and my nurse got me some heated blankets. I went home the next day. 

I start having bloodwork taken after my surgery and had zero parathyroid function. I was having intense muscle cramps and it severely impacted my life and my ability to look after my 2 children. But I still didn’t think much of it and thought they would eventually wake up. 3 months later I see my family doctor and he tells me that they transplanted the only one they could identify into my neck muscle. No one (surgeon or resident) ever told me about this transplant. 

I was told that I had a year before I was considered permanent. So I just prayed every month I would get some function. 2 of my parathyroids showed up in my pathology report eventually. So I don’t know where the 4th one is. 

I ended up calling his office to talk to him after 4 months of it not working to try and get some clarity over what happened. I was hung up on the idea that it was actually the resident that did the surgery not him. He said he did the surgery. He now calls me every few months to check how I am doing? Which seems kinda weird. It’s been almost 2 years. 

Last week I went to my family doctor and we were talking about my journey because I now take 20 pills/supplements a day and it’s been really difficult. He asked me if the surgeon ever apologized to me. This took me back a bit. I had come to terms with what had happened and was feeling thankful he at least tried to transplant one back. My family doctor said “he killed your parathyroids..that should have never happened. I know you aren’t the type for a lawsuit but I can’t believe he didn’t apologize.” He then was saying it was his conscience calling me every few months. 

So I feel like now I’m confused and wondering if I should be angry with him? Should he have told me about the transplant I had? I just find it weird it was never brought up until my family doctor got the operation report. My quality of life has diminished tremendously. I’m a mom of two young kids. The entire first year of my sons life was filled with uncertainty and stress. (Cancer was found when he was 4 days old on a ct scan and my surgery was when he was 6 months old). 

Is he wrong? Is it weird he calls me to check in? Or is my family doctor wrong for saying all that he did?

"30 female:  anxiety,  depression,  ptsd, adhd, pcos,  migrains, hs.  Trazadone,  lexapro, concerta, Ativan Lamictal. 

Symptoms: nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain for over a week. The lower right quadrant of my abdomen has sharp stabbing pain but it's not constant, it cones and goes through the day. Overall discomfort and pain (pressure/cramping) in abdomen as well. No fever. No active vomiting but I have taken emetrol when the nausea is bad. 

I don't have money to go to the doctor but depending on insight given here, I can figure something out. Just want to know how concerning it is. No one around me has been sick with a stomach bug or had issues with shared food either. So I've ruled those out. 

TIA",1,"nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, overall, pain, cramping"
"30M here - 5'11, 180-185lbs, Caucasian.  Live in the USA.  depending on the day.  I take Concerta 10mg twice a day, Prozac 60mg once a day, and Lamictal 200mg for ADD/Depression/BiPolar.  Drink probably a bit more than I should, but not as much as the majority of people I know.  (2-3 days a week 3-4 beers each).  I don't use recreational drugs, and I quit smoking 10 years ago and started vaping, which unfortunately I still do.  No existing medical issues otherwise.

I woke up last Thursday (6/20/24) to the top of my right hand being a little numb - it went away quickly, but sporadically through the day it would happen for a few seconds, and then go away.  No other symptoms.

I stupidly googled it, and it seems I either have a pinched nerve, or I'm in the early stages of diabetes.  As far as I can tell, I do not have a history of diabetes in my family - and I don't do sugar, except on special occasions.  I don't like deserts.  I don't put sugar in my coffee.  I only drink water/coffee and the occasional seltzer water.  Tend to eat fairly healthy, and run on average of 20 miles per week.

The only 2 things I think it can be, is that the night before I started feeling this - I was doing mini-moto with a group of folks.  Just a track setup in the back parking lot of our local HD dealership using tires as track guidelines.  My dumbass was getting too competitive and forgot I was 30 years old, and cut a turn too tight and ended up going over the bars and landing on my head.   I felt fine, so jumped back up and finished the race.  Felt fine the rest of the night and didn't think anything else of it.  Woke up the next day and had that issue.

The other thing that I can maybe attribute to it, is that I have an office job and do a lot of typing.  I have a standing desk that I use probably 60% of the time that I'm in the office to help with posture, but maybe carpal tunnel?  I'm not sure.  I've never really had health issues that weren't mental, and now I'm spiraling.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.



EDIT:  Now that I think about it - when I fall face first on my actual real dirtbikes/motorcycles - I obviously react to placing my hands out in front of me to break my fall.  Could that be it?",1,
"(cross posted from the medical advice subreddit w/ some edits)

okay, i didn’t want to have to post here but i feel like this is the only place im going to get any actual advice.

i (bio female, early teenage years but uncomfortable sharing actual age. 5’3, white, 136 lbs) have been having. A lot of fucking issues that have become even more apparent since i caught covid for the first time back in february.

i am incredibly intolerant to heat, have a constant tremor in my hands and legs, a pulse that skyrockets to 110+ bpm when i stand up, chronic fatigue, and excessive hunger despite being able to eat little at all. I’ve always had the heat intolerance and tremor, i originally associated them with my adhd as my dad has similar symptoms.

i have lost 30 pounds since october of 2023, most of it being ~23 lbs between late february and now. i have been on 56 mg of concerta and an unknown dose of prozac (i think 20 mg or so?) for two years, and 10 mg of birth control (don’t remember what brand it is) for a year. I know it’s not my adhd meds, this has only become an issue recently and my pulse was usually around 80 bpm.

my psychiatrist and general physician are BOTH concerned about me having hyperthyroidism. i got bloodwork recently, but everything came back normal excluding low co2 levels (but that was due to my trypanophobia)

i’m so tired and i cannot function like this.",1,"tremor, heat intolerance, tremor, ##yper, ##roid"
"25F, 5'4, 200lbs, mixed race (black/white), 150mg Lamictal, 28mg Concerta, Birth control pills. I have polyarthritis (idk where, it was just listed in the diagnosis), fibromyalgia, maybe(?) an old labral tear in my hip? (military medical is trash, refused to prove. just suspected), GERD, early onset carpal tunnel, 50% mobility loss in my hips, knees, and back according to the VA. I'm also a smoker (cigarettes from 17-20, vape from 20-present).

My primary issue is with my hips. I've had this popping issue since I was 14. When I was 10 years old I had my first episode of, what i assumed was, sciatica. I was laying on the floor and I couldn't move because of the immense pain I felt in my back. I wasn't able to get up for about 5 minutes and then I was finally able to move again. This didn't happen again until I was 14 (that I can remember), and I remember being in computer class and when I got up I couldn't bend down without extreme pain in my back and hip/knees giving out if I tried to bend over. I had dropped my jacket and had to have a friend pick it up because I just couldn't or I would've fallen over. Later that year I moved in with my aunt and she said that she had the same issues but popping her hips helped. She taught me how and it was INSTANT relief. Ever since then, I have to pop my hips on a daily basis or they will lock up/give out and I'm in extreme pain. I understand that I am overweight now (kinda hard to workout these days between the chronic fatigue and pain, it's lovely), but as a child I never was. I was super active, lived on a farm, took care of animals all day, constantly outside.

NOW, the military **OBVIOUSLY** didn't help with this issue lol. I first went to medical about my hips in 2018. They took xrays and were like ""there's no misalignment. idk why you're in pain"" and gave me 800mg of ibuprofen. I went out to town to an urgent care bc I thought civilian docs would help more, they did the same thing. I went to medical 4 times for my hips (and knees bc my right knee started giving out. was given a brace and sent on my way) before I just gave up. All they would give me were xrays and then just shrug and give me more ibuprofen.  
During 2020 I was working out (doing in-and-outs), and my hip was popping. I thought nothing of it and pushed through. BIG MISTAKE. I woke up the next morning and could barely put my uniform on because of how much pain I was in (right hip when I look, left hip if you're looking at me), I got into my car to head to work and getting in was **TERRIBLE**, moving my leg from the gas to the break caused an insane amount of pain. I made an appointment with medical and when I went they told me they ""suspected"" a labral tear in my hip. I said okay, what do I do about that. They said PT and stop popping my hips. Well... I literally cannot walk without doing that and PT made the pain SOOOO much worse. I couldn't walk the next day afterwards but had to push through for work. They refused to give me an MRI because they said ""PT will help, just keep going"".

Fast forward to 2022, I'm going to VA appointments for my disability. (second round for an increase), this is when I find out that there is a possibility that I could have a compressed disc in my back, a slipped disc, OR arthritis. Couldn't confirm, didn't suggest imaging to the VA. Same shit different day with the military.

So here I am, over 10 years later, still popping my hips. If I pop nothing at all (hips, knees or ankles) I am walking like a penguin bc I'm so stiff, every step hurts and if it goes on too long, my hip and knee will give out. Still have no answers. I have VA health so I'm making an appointment soon and HOUNDING them to give me an MRI.

***My suspicion as to why this all started:*** When I was 8 years old, I was riding one of our horses bareback around the property with my friend. At 8 I was like 4'8 and this horse was 15hh (5 ft from the ground to the withers \*bone at the bottom of their neck\*). She ended up spooking, I slid ass first off of HER ass and landed on the hard ground. It hurt so bad to walk for days, hurt to stand, hurt like HELL to sit. Couldn't jog for about a week. Pain didn't completely subside until about 2-2.5wks later. My mother refused to take me to the hospital to make sure there were no hairline fractures on my tailbone or to see if it was bruised. I was still growing at this point so I don't know if maybe I actually DO have a compressed disc from that?

I know I need to get the imaging and it's really hard to tell what could potentially be happening over a reddit thread. But I'm just super curious to hear what others may think happened.  
I'm 25, 100% disabled and just feel like a walking bruise 24/7. Anything helps at this point lol

"47 F, 5'9"", 146 lbs., white, excess gas starts the minute I wake up until nearly bedtime, ADHD, Autistic, asthma, Concerta 36mg, Zoloft unknown dose (30-50 mg), 1 pill of Black Cohosh daily (for menopause symptoms), 1 daily Centrum multivitamin, no carbonated drinks, no alcohol, no smoking, no drugs, CANADA.

I was previously on Vyvanse and Escitalopram and experienced an excessive amount of gas build-up only a few months later. I stopped taking those meds and switched to Concerta and Zoloft. I have been on the new meds (Concerta & Zoloft) for 10 days. The first 8 days were perfect: no gas, no belly sensitivities/pain, and a normal appetite. Two days ago, on Wednesday, May 29, 2024, I decided to make a cup of Earl Grey Tea. I hadn't had any tea in over a week, so I thought it was okay because the excess gas from the last meds had finally disappeared. BOY WAS I WRONG! Maybe a half hour after drinking 5 sips of tea, I started to feel nauseous. My stomach started to hurt and I was burping. I tried all the things... Gas-X? Nope. Activated charcoal? Nope. Mint tea? Nope. A walk? Ehh, not really? The distraction of the walk helped, but the belly pain was still there. I guess the pain is anywhere from a 4-6, considering how little or how much I might have burped. Saltine crackers? No. Ginger candy for the nausea? Nope.

Today, on Friday, I woke up and made a glass of water with lemon juice because I thought I had read that this is good to drink when first waking up to make the stomach more alkaline. No. Forgot lemon juice is acidic.

I don't have IBS, my lactose intolerance is very mild so I can eat dairy once a day without issues, and my doctor didn't seem to care when I mentioned it (but she was busy with other stuff, and I have ADHD so, of course, I didn't think to re-mention it later). I don't have food intolerances, and I don't have anything medically wrong with my abdomen. I just ate or drank the wrong thing ONCE, and now my stomach will overproduce acid every day until I stop taking my medication for an extended period of time. Quitting Vyvanse and Escitalopram and taking a few days off reset my system. But I'm at my wit's end now. How can 5 sips of caffeinated tea affect me for days and weeks to follow despite eating mostly alkaline foods? All I ate this morning (Friday, May 31st) was a slice of brown toast with some margarine on it, and a sliced banana (and that stupid lemon water which was probably the culprit for today).

How can I stop my body from making this a daily thing? The pain isn't super high (right now it's probably a level 4), but it makes doing anything hard because of the discomfort. It's highly distracting and I can't focus on anything. I tried calling the local nurse hotline, but all she said was ""go to the hospital."" I told her I was autistic and I didn't understand the level of pain I'm feeling on her scale because all she said was ""Zero is not painful and 10 is really bad"" or something like that. So she wasn't helpful.

My goal is to be able to return to feeling NORMAL. No gas, no nausea related to excess gas, no belly sensitivities, no burping for 4 hours straight (I kid you not, this is actually happening as I type this). The only solution I can think of is to stop taking my medication cold turkey and let my body reset, then start taking them again on Monday morning. It was the only thing that worked last time.

Maybe you have a better solution? I'm at my wit's end. Crying from feeling like shit from waking up to bedtime. The only time I feel fine is sometime around 11 pm when it's finally time for bed, only to wake up at 6 again and my stomach hasn't even had food and it starts to overproduce gas (this is the behavior only when the gas starts from eating or drinking a bad food... in this case, the Earl Grey tea on Wednesday morning).

PS: I do eat a large portion of dandelion leaf salad with dinner with a side of spaghetti and meat sauce, but I don't think it's related to fiber as I don't eat fiber for breakfast. I've had fiber-related gas before in the past, but it was stomach bloating, not this level of bloating with the feeling of it going up to my throat and making me feel nauseous.

PSS: I was feeling super horrible when I started this post, but I've drunk about 3/4 cup of very warm mint tea, got up a few times, and let out a lot of gas through some burps. The pain and nausea have subsided a bit, but the recurrence of the gas daily is puzzling and what I want to find out.

PSSS: Due to my autism, I would ask if you could please be specific in your questions. Don't leave out any details. Ask me bluntly if you have to.",1,"gas build - up, ##use, overp, ##uce, stomach, ##use, gas, gas"
"Alright. I’m at a loss here. 

I (22F) had a laproscopic appendectomy in late November of 2023. One week later, into December, I had a 5mm kidney stone get stuck in my right ureter. I went to the hospital, but I passed it in the hospital bathroom. The next day, I had similar kidney pain, went back to the hospital, and a piece of the stone had gotten stuck at the base of my right kidney and swelled it shut. I was about to lose my kidney, so I had a laser lithotripsy done and a stent placed to help pass any remnants. I had the stent out a week later without any anesthetics. I got upset that my house needed cleaned, so 2 weeks after both operations, I cleaned my whole house. I have had right side pain ever since accompanied with very odd bowel patterns ranging from diarrhea to constipation. I figured it was because I had my appendix out and that was just my life now. However, I was in the hospital in February for the dull right side pain where I was told there is nothing wrong with me, no more stones, nothing going on after CT. I went back in March after I moved across the country for the same right side pain. This time, attending radiologist found multiple non-obstructing stones in both my kidneys. Ok, whatever, I thought at least I wasn’t insane saying I had pain. No idea how I developed multiple stones in less than a month, but whatever. It’s now June. I’ve had the pain in my right side now since NOVEMBER of 2023. Yesterday, I notice a very odd & slightly stiff bump in my upper right quadrant, near the bottom of my ribs, but above my midline. I kept poking it thinking maybe I was mistaking a rib, but the other side did not have the bump. I went back to the hospital yesterday, where they gave me the wrong patient paperwork and I have no idea what is wrong with me. Attending doc said I was completely fine, but the radiologist failed to find the lack of an appendix in my CT paperwork or the surgical clips… or the fact that I have hardware from a spinal fusion from T3-T12 for scoliosis. In fact, the comparison was from 2020… and I just moved here in MARCH. I still have the lump in my right side, weird bowel patterns, and constant nausea/lack of appetite. I’ve lost probably 30lbs in the last 3 months and I only weigh a total of 99lbs. I’m 5’0” for context. 

I’ve had a spinal fusion, T&A removal, appendectomy, and a laser lithotripsy with a stent. That is all of my surgical history. I currently take Concerta 36mg for ADHD, Ritalin IR 10mg prn for the same reason, Buspar 20mg 3x daily for anxiety, Seroquel 25mg for sleep, Ativan prn for anxiety, Pepcid 20mg for indigestion, dicyclomine for gut spasms prn, Xyzal 5mg daily for allergies, and Errin birth control mini-pill daily. 

I’ve been diagnosed with scoliosis (obviously), an incomplete right bundle branch block (genetic), left anterior fascicular block (long-COVID), interstitial cystitis (following kidney stones), orthostatic hypotension, hypoglycemia, IBS, osteoporosis (also genetic), and arthritis following my spinal fusion.

Can someone please shed any light on what the dull (sometimes sharp) pain and bump in my right side is? I am so tired of going to the hospital or doctor to be told nothing is wrong when I clearly have a lump in my right side now. 

Edit to add: I am nearly sure it’s a complication from my appendectomy or a hernia, but I don’t know because I am not a doctor. I can still urinate, I still have weird bowel movements, and I am fine as of currently. I just have the weird dull pain. It hurts worse if I continually poke the bump, which I have been doing recently to see if it’s still there.

For about the last month and a half I’ve noticed my muscles twitching significantly more often than they used to. Like once every few minutes max. 

It’s not like when you’re tired and your eye twitches. It’s like my leg jumps, or a muscle in my back quickly tenses like I would if I were to go to sit up straight, or my neck jerks, or I wink, or I take a small involuntary breath (like a hiccup but not quite), etc., there’s no specific muscles it happens to more often, and there’s no warning or feeling that it’ll happen beforehand. It’s not uncommon if I go to do something that requires precise movements like cracking an egg that I involuntary move my hand too fast, or if I’m writing my hand jerks across the page a bit.

Doctors, how apparent are the signs and symptoms of a heat stroke? I had a recent encounter with what I assume to be heat exhaustion 2 days ago. I was mowing the lawn for a few hours outside. My symptoms were: persistent thirst, throbbing headache, lightheadedness, chills, and sweating (though I was inside). Interestingly enough, these symptoms didn’t show up until 2 hours after coming back inside.  I still feel kind of foggy and tired. I am not a smoker and I take two medications: concerta and fluoxetine. I am wondering if this is part of the healing process, or if its a sign of something more serious. Is it perhaps possible to survive a heat stroke without ever knowing that you had one.",1,"persistent thirst, throbbing headache, lightheadedness, chills, sweating"
"I moved last winter, so I’m nervous about talking to my current psych about my desire to come off my meds and whether I still meet diagnosis criteria.

I have been on meds for about three years now after my mental health got really bad. I did some serious long term treatment and therapy programs, kept up with a regular therapist I was able to stop seeing before my move, and I’ve been stable with my mental health and those around me agree. No panic attacks, any anxiety and depression symptoms that come up I’m able to manage, and some ADD symptoms that don’t get in the way of daily life. I take seroquel to help me sleep and I’m on a small dose of intuniv for the ADD symptoms so I can focus better at work. My goal would be able to sleep without the meds and only need the ADD one if there were no other ways to manage my symptoms. I want to start a family and I’ve heard that meds aren’t always doable when pregnant and nursing, so I question if I really need to stay on them.

I also question if I still meet the criteria for the BPD diagnosis I got in treatment. Thanks to treatment and therapy, the symptoms I once had when I got that diagnosis have, to myself and my husband at least, gone away and I haven’t had to deal with them in a long time. This is what I really mean by I feel stable with my mental health.

So I guess the real question is, since this is a relatively new doctor still, how do I bring up these topics with them? What do you think a good/safe plan (even if it’s a long term plan) would be for becoming med free? What should this conversation with them be like?",1,

"Hello! First time poster looking to hear other people's stories, experiences, advice or general input regarding comorbid ADHD and Aspergers. 

For a long time I always felt I was different, sometimes superior to others, as i felt the way I thought was so different and unique. I never in my life thought I'd have ADHD or Aspergers (ASD 1/2). Long story short i began to suffer Anxiety and other self esteem issues around 17 after my first relationship. Fast forward to 19 i began to smoke weed every night as a form of relaxing as it was the first I've experienced the sensations of being relaxed. 

Then came the memory and executive functioning issue's, further relationship issues and experimenting with anti-depressants on and off at 21, 22, 23 and 25. Nothing worked at all prior and I was reluctant to try anything that wasn't valium (first time using it). The doctor put me on paroxatine and then a few nights  I had some fucked up dreams, such as: Dead disfigured bodies in an apartment I used to live in, dreams of being in the doctors and having the nurses and doctors conintuously saying ""just do it, just take it"" (regarding pristiq) and dreams that just where amazing, but also some gruesome dreams. The morning am I had the dream regarding pristiq, I woke up and instantly went to the doctors to switch to it, instead of paroxetine. Upon starting pristiq shit got real weird, I would randomly hyper focus and have so much motivation followed by using cocaine every second weekend or so and smoking weed again after quitting prior. I knew something wasn't right but it's almost as if my brain wanted me to be self destructive and go down this path. 

After seeing my psychologist for 4 months, I had a instinctual feeling one day to ask them what ADHD was, I related to all they spoke about. I then had to wait a while and I eventually had an appointment with the ADHD and Nuroscience specialist psychiatrist (Very fucking expensive, $700 a session). During this appointment the psychatrist is painting a picture of my psyche after reviewing the psychological refferal and clinical report. After that appointment I was shocked and in denial about the suggestion that I may have aspergers aswell as ADHD. I felt angry, sad, confused and overwhelmed. But most of all, in denial. I had an appointment with their psychologist to do more nurological testing and consults. The nurological testing suggested I have a Aspergie cognitive function, but suggestively have ADHD also. I was told they can exist together and keep eachother in check, but also conflict at times. After that appointment I left feeling so angry, confused and just wanting some medication that actually works so I can get my shit together. I began to feel extremely depressed and angry soon after. I felt as if my life has been flipped upside down and i just am extremely jealous of nurotypical people now. I also feel like a dickhead for being so judgmental my whole adolescent life. 

I suppose I don't really know how to gather and conpile my thoughts, but I was hoping to hear if anyone else has had anything similar happen and if their quality of life improved with medication, if so, what medication?  

Is it normal to feel extremely frustrated, upset and angry about this? My psychiatrist won't prescribe, won't offer advice or anything till the next appointment and my doctor can't do anything as his not qualified to treat it and my anxiety treatments with SSRI's didn't work. I've been told to read up on Straterra and Intuniv by my Psychatrist a few weeks ago, but I don't know why that would be suggested over a stimulant? And can any medication actually help Aspergers? I've lost all motivation and really began to question what's the point if I have no quality of life. I would never act on those thoughts, but I've identified them forming after trailing Clomid for two weeks and having to stop due to putting on 6kg, loosing executive functions and those thoughts.",1,loosing executive functions
"So - a little back ground:

My son turned 7 in October.  When he was younger we noticed that some things were just ""not right"" with him.  After being told  when he was 4 to have a neuro-psychological exam done due to many red flags for aspergers, he was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, phonological disorder, encopresis, ADHD, and oppositional behavioral disorder.   He has been in and out of treatment since then (I have yet to see any results and everyone just wants to dope him up). In November I decided to go ahead and medicate him with Intuniv.  This was really helping with the behavioral issues. 

My son was removed from the general ed classroom and placed in a classroom for emotional disability - this was decided through his IEP as he could not properly function (throwing things, hitting people, breaking things, and all out anger) in the general ed classroom.  School slowly got better.  Then came winter break...

When he came back from winter break, his teacher had left and he had a new one (he had worked with her before so knew who she was).  The teacher changed the classroom setting (instead of individual desks there are circular desks that everyone can sit at) and he now has two classrooms (one to start the day in, one to have the day in, and one to end the day in).  Now, he all of a sudden REALLY hates school - to the point the teachers have to call me to get him to settle down.  He says that everyone hates him, that I hate him, he says that he wants to die, and he's isolating himself from classmates and the school.  He refuses to go into the lunchroom now and eats in the classroom alone (with the teacher in there), he is refusing to go to ""specials"" (music, gym, and whatnot), and is refusing to everything except for math (he loves math and is well above his grade-level).

Yesterday, he told me it was opposite day so I played along.  He told me he was smart - to which I said he is very smart.  He said that it was opposites day which means that he's stupid.  He keeps calling himself stupid and dumb.  I talk to him about how smart he is, I try to speak with him about what he's saying and what it actually means (like I want to die).  He laid his head in his teachers lap the other day and cried saying over and over again that he wants to die.

I am so overwhelmed as a single parent and I have suffered, and still do, depression.  Is he becoming depressed?  Is it just the change in school?

He was attending therapy thru a mental health organization (they visited his school) but I can't afford it and they won't see him anymore because I am behind on payments.  Do I need to take him to have in depth studies done.  I just want to help him and I feel tied because I can't.  

Are there any others out there that have gone through the same thing and have been able to find low cost places or organizations that are free.  I make more than the ""allotted"" poverty line so I don't qualify for most sliding scale places.  I just want to help him but I don't know how.  One minute he's find and then as soon as a non-preferred task comes along he's off the charts.  Majorly.  It could be as simple as me telling him to put his shoes on.  He's such a sweet and loving boy - overly attached to me in my opinion - but he's so loving and I know that he wants to be well!! ",1,encop
"I (32f) was happily on Adderall until January and now I can't get it at all, I've tried Concerta but it really affects my mood in a bad way.

My doctor just prescribed Intuniv but I can't seem to find much info on it. As far as I can tell it's more of a mood stabilizer and helps with impulse control which I could very much use. Though I've read it can affect libido which kinda scares me.

Can anyone tell me how it affected them? Positives and negatives.

Thank you.

Update: I've now been on this for 15 days, the sleepiness has lessened a good amount which is good. 

My emotions are kinda weird, I still have negative thoughts but they don't hold me like they used to. Like something negative could normally tank my whole day with a downward spiral but now I can kind of acknowledge it and move on. It's kinda strange cause that's a very new feeling for me.

I'm not sure if I've noticed anything focus or motivation wise, but I think it's easier to keep working or doing stuff when I'm not in a downward spiral from something minor.

So I'm still not 100% sure about it but it's not bad.",1,
"DISCLAIMER: This is NOT medical advice and is composed of information sourced from various studies which I plan to cite later, as well as damn near every testimonial available on the Internet regarding guanfacine ER/Intuniv. 

However, all of the information online is ambiguous, contradictory, and scattered, so I thought synthesizing/summarizing it would be helpful (on top of satisfying my bottom-up learning itch). 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall Action:
Agonism of post-synaptic A2-A receptors

Hypothesized Mechanism In ADHD Treatment:

Initial (acute administration):

Sedative effect by potentially acting on A2 receptors in thalamus

60% less adrenal plasma flow & 20% less carbachol-induced catecholamine release from potential action on A2 receptors in adrenal gland 

Overall inhibition of arousal state due to decreased sympathetic activity, can be anxiolytic

Final (chronic administration):

Downregulation of A2 receptors (""tolerance"") leads to... 

Removal of sedation & hypoarousal effect 

Improved noradrenergic transmission to the frontal lobe

[Net increase in basal release of norepinephrine in (OFC, VTA, RTN) directly + dopamine in (OFC) indirectly; this is because post-synaptic agonism still continues, while sedation ends] 

Enhanced connectivity/glutamatergic transmission to the prefrontal cortex (where long-term benefit arises)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Potential Side Effects

Initial (pre-tolerance):

- Fatigue/sleepiness
- Lack of motivation or urgency
- Depression/anhedonia
- Severe irritation at small things
- Sensory sensitivity
- Impaired working memory
- Brain fog
- Restlessness & flitting from task to task without completion
- Dissociative feeling 

Note: These depend on basal arousal state and other individual/contextual factors (Ex: Taking a stimulant alongside). 

Final (post-tolerance):

- Persisting insomnia/nightmares (if taken at night initially, moving to daytime should alleviate)
- Heightened aggression/hostility
- Manic behavior
- Paranoia

If these persist, then Intuniv is likely not the right medication for you; the increased norepinephrine can be detrimental if you don't have a pre-existing imbalance in that regard.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Breaking down this technical stuff; Intuniv is not intended as an anti-anxiety medication, and people expecting this will be let down in the 2 week - 1 month acclimation period to a single dose. 

Essentially, Intuniv acts to improve transmission & connectivity of pre-existing neurotransmitters to the frontal lobe. 

There is a dual benefit of Intuniv:
1) Increased norepinephrine in the frontal lobe 

#1 is where its benefit as an adjunct to stimulants comes into play, however it's milder than an NRI like Strattera; this is demonstrated when the sedative effect is fully built tolerance to. It typically occurs within 2 weeks to 1 month. This effect is more noticeable when using dopamine-acting stimulants, like methylphenidate. 

You'll see anxiety reduction as a function of confidence and energy, NOT as a decrease in sympathetic activity; the latter is just a temporary side effect, and you're better off seeking out medications that intend to do this primarily.

Sensory-based anxiety will be improved by increased norepinephrine in the thalamic reticular nucleus which allows for better filtering, but NOT by decreased overall arousal for the same reason as above. 

2) Enhanced pre-frontal cortex activity by heightened glutamatergic transmission

#2 is a long-term benefit that strengthens over time, rewiring your frontal lobe the longer you take the medication. This benefit is seen more subtly and after a month or two, and directly targets executive function in a long-lasting way. This is associated with a heightened sense of identity, improved planning ability, working memory, sensibility, & operating at a ""middle ground"" instead of extremes. 

The side effects of this 24-hour medication are unforgiving, especially for adults who are working 9-5 jobs & can't afford borderline non-functionality for weeks. The ambiguity surrounding it & (understandable) intolerability frequently lead to discontinuation. 

Think of it like an elastic band, where things get exponentially worse before they get better. 

In my opinion, the weekly titration period before deciding Intuniv dosage increase is laughable, and does more harm than good due to unnecessary elongation of the pre-adjustment period (and by proxy, side effects). 

It's faster to titrate this way, but can lead to more severe post-adjustment adrenal rebound affects & it becomes difficult to judge the actual efficacy of each dose 

Based on the above information, increases shouldn't be considered until a month has elapsed on the current dose.

Keep in mind, there's a lot left to be accounted for and confirmed with further research, but this is what I drew from analysis of what is currently available.",1,"##echolamine, fatigue, sensory, brain fog, restlessness, di, manic behavior, paranoia, adrenal rebound affects"
"i was super excited to add guanfacine onto my vyvanse, especially because of its reputation for helping with rsd. however, it did the absolute opposite! it felt so sneaky in the way that i had assumed the effects i was experiencing were just ~me~ and my fault

i’ve trialed so many meds, but guanfacine has been by far the worst for me. it made me so deeply depressed and withdrawn yet afraid to be alone. i was calling out of work because i couldn’t get myself out of bed. i swear everything looked more gray. everything felt scary again like driving, grocery shopping, work. if i wasn’t weeping, i was hostile, irritable, and impulsive. i felt like any progress i made in regulating my emotions in the past 5 years was gone. i somehow went from having a few grand saved up to $35 to my name. i had absolutely no control. no motivation, no joy, nothing. and because that isn’t enough, it also gave me this strange paranoia and weight gain.
 
i’m so embarrassed for how i acted while taking this medication for ~3 months. i didn’t feel like myself, but i would have never guessed it was being caused by that medication, and i’m no stranger to negative side effects from psych meds. i’ve completely discontinued it for a few weeks now and am beginning to feel normal again. if it works for you, thats great ofc!!!

"Was doing well on Vyvanse 60mg; after I adjusted to the dose, I lost some of the initial 2-week benefit & some inattentive/impatient/perseveration symptoms started to creep back in

However, I still had a bit of residual stress + side effects from raised norepinephrine

I was debating between going up to Vyvanse 70 or adding Intuniv, and chose the Intuniv

Since starting, my Vyvanse has been getting shittier and shittier, and the symptoms I mentioned have gotten exponentially worse. I'm not interested or motivated to do anything, my difficulty with switching tasks has turned into paralysis, I'm even MORE distracted, and I'm too lazy to eat (my eating habits were better with Vyvanse) 

I have exams on Monday and Tuesday and was making steady progress despite the Vyvanse adjustment, but the Intuniv has turned me into a useless vegetable

It seems to be lowering my norepinephrine, which is supposed to be temporary, but what benefits do I get when I adjust to it?

"I am on Concerta 18mg, which causes some agitation style anxiety, and physical side effects. Switching from generic to brand helped (smoother release). However when I upped to 27mg, the agitation/anxiety was just too much even with brand.

So my psychiatrist recommended I add Intuniv (Guanfacine ER) in. After some persuasion (i.e. nagging), my family doctor reluctantly agreed to let me try. And wow, now after 1.5 months on the lowest dose of Guanfacine (1mg), it's going really well.

It not only reduced Concerta's side effects for me, but also I noticed my RSD and ADHD anxiety have been reduced to much better levels. I don't know that I get any ADHD specific benefits out of it since the dose is so low.

\------------------------------------

*Guanfacine journey:*

The first two weeks of Guanfacine were rough: Even though I took it at bed, during the day I would feel sleepy, and it messed with my mood (weird fits of irritability, and pangs of temporary depression). My sleep was great though.

Then after two weeks it just lifted (my sleep went back to being its usual chaos). Two more weeks later I switched it to morning to see if it made the Concerta work even better but I found it was still slightly sedating and switched it back before bed.

Apparently Intuniv (Guanfacine ER) peaks around 5-8 hours after it's taken. So I might experiment with taking it a little earlier before bed to see if that is better.

I have a psych appointment coming up (new psych at my doctor's insistence) so if she agrees, I will try up my Concerta dose. And perhaps eventually the Guanfacine dose if agitation persists.",1,"agitation style anxiety, physical, agitation, fits of irritability, ##gs, depression"
"I started on Guanfacine 12 days ago (1mg), my only ongoing side effect is fatigue and mind fog, which got better but still there. Imo they negate the stimulant a bit, I now sometimes drink coffee as well.

So far it's helped with emotional lability (and perhaps anxiety a bit), and stimulant side effects. I'm less anxious, irritable and my [RSD](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24099-rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-rsd) is reduced.

However, exciting things seem less so, and I have to pretend to be excited with friends. Beautiful fall colours? ""...yay!"". I just feel somewhat more apathetic about life, I hope it's just the initial side effects and not how Guanfacine works long-term?

In the meantime, I'm having troubles functioning due to (perceived) side effects of the medication.

In the span of two weeks I went from full-on insomnia to sleeping up to 13 hours a day. Despite the long hours of sleep I felt exhausted during the day and had no motivation to get any work done.

Not sure if it's just a sensation, but I feel like I could barely hold my phone while laying in bed, blow dry my hair, type, etc. without my arms feeling strained or like they're about to give out. I also noticed while driving that lifting my foot off the accelerator/brakes involved more effort/caused more strain in my calve than usual.

I started intuniv yesterday but within 30 minutes of taking it i felt numb and i don't know if i should continute taking it because i don't want to have another depressive episode. Does anyone know if straterra or qelbree, (i dont know of any other non-stims) have similar side effects listed?",1,"severely depressed, psychotic episode, depressive episode"
"Well, I just got a month supply of Intuniv (Guanfacine) by my doctor to help with my inattention and forgetfulness. I’m technically only diagnosed with Asperger’s (ASD level 1) but my doctor said this medicine would also apply to me since I also have “ADHD tendencies.” 

Anyone else use or have used this drug before? What should I expect? My doctor champions it as a game-changing drug since it has “very few side effects and powerful results.” Is that really the case? I’m skeptical.

She’s starting me on 2 mg pills everyday and will up the dosage each month to the recommended dosage of 6 mg. She says the effects won’t be noticed for a while. TIA",1,inatt
"I’ve been on a high dose (80 mg) of Vyvanse for some years. I absolutely love it, and it has made a big difference to my life. But wait, you say, there’s more? I’ve been reading about Intuniv. Can someone that takes it tell me how it might help me? As effective as Vyvanse is for my focus and mood, how else might I improve on Intuniv??",1,
"As many of you are aware by now, the current shortage of medications used to treat ADHD has patients and parents of patients who rely on these medications scrambling to fill their prescriptions, leaving some people in a position where they are starting a new medicine or going without.

"So I'm on Straterra and it seems to be working ok. It's definitely better than nothing, but it seems like I need more. More accurately directed focus, more motivation/more ability to just think and do the thing. 

Straterra was working for the motivation and executive functioning, but that has slowed down a lot. I'm back to sitting in my recliner most of the day and not doing my daily tasks. Albeit it's not as bad as unmedicated... I'm still making necessary phone calls and keeping my immediate area clean.

I'm thinking about upping my straterra dose and adding a low dose Adderall ER on days when I need a little extra push.

Straterra is the only thing that works all day for me (All other extended release stimulants wore off very quickly) and straterra isn't overwhelming and anxiety inducing (like stimulants). 

But I've read that guanfacine can increase executive functioning, but is that the IR or ER version, or both?

The IR version helps my blood pressure when it gets too high from stress, anxiety, and overstimulation;

But would I have better executive functioning on the extended release version?

I so desperately need to be able to act on the things I want/need to do without the executive dysfunction blockade.

Also: Guanfacine makes me INSANELY thirsty, which if doesn't go away, I may quit the medication. My wife says dry mouth can cause a myriad of teeth issues (she's a dental assistant).",1,"thirsty, dry mouth"
"Wow, I was seriously underestimating the “possible” side effects with this one… One possible side effect is “drowsiness” and I experienced that on DAY FREAKING 1. And what’s even more weird is that I’m taking such a low dosage. My doctor started me on just 2 mg a day before gradually working my way up to 6 mg as a full dosage. How do people do this?? I’m only on day 2 and have serious drowsiness. Can’t keep my eyes open sometimes. Oh, and dry mouth today. That’s a first for me. Is this normal?",1,"drowsiness, drowsiness, dry mouth"
"Hi there, I have hypertension so I'm probably looking at guanfacine. However I'm predominantly inattentive and I just read this piece that speculated that guanfacine wouldn't be that great for Inattentive ([https://www.adxs.org/en/page/189/guanfacine-for-adhd](https://www.adxs.org/en/page/189/guanfacine-for-adhd) \- paragraph 6). On the other hand I think I heard Dr. Russell Barkley recommend non-stimulants for inattentive? Anecdotally has anybody had great success with it?  Thanks all!",1,
"I’m currently done with my first 8 days of Intuniv at 2 mg doses each day. I started with extreme drowsiness which lasted for like 2 days straight. A major headache the first night. Stomach pains on the fourth night. And now a lingering, overall lack of energy (lethargy). I can’t keep up with my 1-year-old anymore and the wife is getting upset that I’m not active like I used to be around the house. She thinks I’m faking low-energy and just being lazy.

I’m pretty sure the low energy is due to lowered blood pressure by the medication. Also getting other low-blood pressure symptoms: blurry vision, dizziness, lightheadedness, sleepiness, etc.

Please tell me these side effects go away. I can’t keep living like this just to get rid of my forgetfulness and inattention…",1,"drowsiness, headache, stomach pains, lack of energy, lethargy, lowered blood pressure, low - blood pressure symptoms, blurry vision, dizziness, lightheadedness, sleepiness"
"I currently taking 2mg right before bed - and I mean right before, like take it after I brush my teeth and turn in.  I don't experience any difficulties falling asleep (unlike when I was taking Dexedrine).  I think it's starting to subtly help (it's been 5 weeks, 2 weeks on 2mg)  but I keep finding myself sorta running out of brain power at 3pm. Like I can't focus, can't remember anything and I'm wiped out.  Initially I as taking it in the AM but I found myself a little drowsy, and it bugged my stomach a bit - plus avoiding protein was rough at breakfast time - but I was doing ok, though I did switch to the evenings before my dose went up to 2mg.  I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this? I have an appointment with my Dr mid month to talk about my experiences, and whether we should continue with it, but I'd like to know I'm giving it my best shot because I have run the medication gamut over the last three years.  Dexedrine works ok for me, but the racing heart rate is a lot - and I'm approaching my mid 50s so that stuff kinda makes me more nervous than it used to.  I'd very much like this to be a successful alternative, but I'm not done my day at 3pm!!  
",1,"drowsy, racing heart rate"
"I’ve been on Intuniv for a few months now and I take it before bed as instructed by my psych, but I feel it’s making me not sleep. When I first started it made me drowsy briefly but then I was up all night, but that leveled out somewhat. I’m thinking of switching it to the morning. For those of you that take a morning dose of this, do you feel it makes you drowsy? Is there any sort of crash later in the day? Has anyone else had problems not sleeping on this?",1,"drowsy, drowsy"
"I was on 50mg of vyvanse but when renewing it I noted that it makes me anxious and wears off my 1pm. So my doctor is getting me to try Intuniv XR 1mg. Not really knowing anything about it I decided to give it a try but now looking it up and seeing it makes people sleepy??? I’m so sleepy already. I see people take both but she said she can’t prescribe two different things. 
What are peoples experiences? What can so expect?? Does it help you focus and do things during the day?? Does it help with mental clarity? I’m not so much hyperactive but more spacey so I’m worried.",1,
"Of course I'll talk to my dr, but I want to go in ""prepared"" a bit, so I can have a proper discussion. It seems there's an IR and ER version --or maybe intuniv is the ER version, idk. I want to add it to my stimulants to help combat those side effects -- mainly blood pressure spikes and some of the anxiety/restless/irritability that can occur along the way. Blood pressure regulation is probably the most important aspect right now for me.

I've seen it can cause drowsiness, so I figured maybe I'd see about taking it at night, which would be a great effect to help my insomnia, I hope-- but will I miss out on the blood pressure help if I don't take them together in the morning? I assume if I take at night, I'd definitely need the ER version at least. But if that doesn't help BP at all or much, guess I'll be stuck playing with the IR til I find what works.

I can NOT risk any more loss of function right now, and I definitely can't risk being drowsy during the day, etc.

"Hello everyone I have been on Intuniv for a little over two weeks now and I have gotten some of its side effects such as dizziness when awaking, loss of appetite and major brain fog. There is something else I’ve noticed, I feel like I have a filter on my eyes sometimes and my eyes will feel out of sync if that makes any sense. It happens more with my right eye where my vision will be a little blurry and I feel like my eye cant focus. Is this a normal side effect or should I be more concerned?",1,"dizziness, loss of appetite, major brain fog, blurry"
"I have been taking 2mg of Intuniv and its  been great my moods is better and its has never been better. But I still can't make myself do stuff, at first I think as a placebo I felt like I did stuff like laundry but as time went on I just don't do anything. When I faced something difficult I couldn't make myself do it. I have just started taking medication and the doctor says I'll have to increase the doesage of it before I can take other medication. But I don't think Intuniv real does anything for me. Am I just lazy and I don't have ADHD all this time? Was everything I been through was just my incompetency, I don't know. I'm living in Japan so I can really get Adderral or like that.",1,
"I switched my Intuniv from nighttime to the mornings, because it started making it hard to fall asleep; my mind felt awake

Now, I can fall asleep fine, but I keep waking up around the same time at night and being unable to fall back asleep (around the peak of guanfacine) and it's been a little more than a week since I switched to mornings

Has anyone else experienced anything similar?

For context, I've been taking 60mg of Vyvanse alongside Intuniv, but I've been on that for much longer and it never affected my sleep like this",1,
"I (23F) am taking medicine for ADHD for the first time. Due to other mental health conditions I have, stimulants aren’t an option.

My doctor prescribed me Intuniv (1mg) and I’ve taken one dose. I have observed quite a bit of drowsiness, but I have heard this can diminish after a month or so.

"Hey everyone I’ve recently started Intuniv about 3 weeks ago as I’ve never liked stimulant meds for my ADHD and they just discontinued Strattera which I’ve taken for years.

I’m having some weird motion related side effects. When I’m a passenger in a vehicle I get really uncomfortable to acceleration and high speeds. It feels like the world is ending and that I I’m going to throw up. When I’m driving it’s fine though.

"Recently switched psychiatrists, and my new doc switched me from 15mg of Adderall to 1mg of Guanfacine/ Intuniv. The Adderall had been helping with my energy but it wasn't giving me much of a focus boost unfortunately. I'm now 4 days in to the Guanfacine and not only has my focus not improved much (though my sensory overload has,) but I'm just absolutely wiped out and exhausted all day. I take it in the afternoon, but it doesn't seem to make much of a difference.

Today I could barely function with how tired I was and I'm considering not taking it tonight and reaching out to my new doc in the morning to get his thoughts, but I wanted to know others experiences. Is it worth sticking with it a while longer even if it zaps all my energy?",1,sensory overload
"Hi Guys, I’m starting to freak out a little cause I’m unsure whether I’ve accidentally doubled my Intuniv dose. I’m on 4mg, and last night I couldn’t remember if I took it, and didn’t mark it as logged in my med book so I took it anyway, but was unsure whether I’d doubled up.

It’s been about 17 hours since I took it, my HR is normal, maybe a bit lower than normal, but I feel really drowsy.

Should I go to the ER?",1,"short of breath, tight chest"
"I was diagnosed about 3 1/2 weeks ago and was immediately put on 10 mg daily dose. From what my doctor was trying to explain to me, the next two weeks were going to be used as a trial period to see how I did on the medication. Im guessing this is common practice. The medication pretty much did nothing made me feel tired and kinda sick at times. Explaining this to him during my two week follow up, I get out on Intuniv because of my reaction to the Strattera, Adderall would probably have even more of a negative affect. This really bummed me out as I’ve heard how stimulants have helped a lot of people manage their ADHD symptoms and I really wanted to give it a try. So far the Intuniv has no noticeable affect. I just want to feel normal, should I see another doctor? What was your experience like?",1,##trattera
"I just came off of Intuniv/guanfacine after 2 years and I was amazed at how much happier I was. My new psych had a suspicion that I was in a small percentage of ppl who have terrible adverse reactions when on the medication after a certain amount of time. 

Things I’ve noticed now that I’ve been off of it for about 2.5 weeks: 

I used to be just a waking zombie even with increases in my addy from my doc, I was always tired, always fatigued, and was 10lbs heavier despite zero diet or activity changes. 

It was constantly dehydrating me and I was retaining so much water that I was just chronically uncomfortable. Like I couldn’t get hydrated and stay that way for long. Even drinking my docs recommended daily water and electrolyte intake, every morning I would wake up dehydrated to the point of my urine being orange. 

I was irritable, aggravated, depressed, and angry like 90% of the time. 

I developed kidney stones at 31(f) despite never having them before and 0 family history of them

I kept getting concerning results on my liver enzyme tests despite me doing nothing that should cause liver problems (my liver is in perfect health as of my results & ultrasound last week) 


I felt like I woke up from a terrible waking dream that just wouldn’t end. 

I’m curious how many people have ever had so many adverse effects from this medication. I’m so thankful my new psych was observant enough to take me off of it, and I only wish this had happened a year ago.",1,kidney stones
"im curious because the straterra i've been taking for about six months and i haven't noticed a difference.... so my dr decided to add on the intuniv today so ill start that as soon as i receive it. 

I started with cerebral, so intuniv was my only other real option since they no longer prescribe new stimulant prescriptions. 

i read someone say that with the straterra they felt they wanted to smoke a lot and drink a lot of coffee.. but that stopped once they added the intuniv.. but they ultimately stopped the intuniv due to bad memory.

i'd love any other anecdotes :)",1,
"so i’ve been on concerta for 10+ years and, as i’m sure everyone else on it knows, it can make me super anxious. my mom heard from another person around my age with adhd that she’s taking both concerta and guanfacine (brand name intuniv) which helps manage her anxiety. naturally being a massive nerd i went first to reading a recent study on the two medications together, which was supportive of the combination saying task efficiency was improved more taking both than taking one—BUT i was hoping someone else might have personal experience they could share.",1,
"I had been on it for a month alongside Vyvanse 60mg, and discontinued it 5 days ago due to strong depressive symptoms and fatigue.

I feel these things slowly improving, but I can tell the Intuniv is lingering in my system

Whenever I get too excited/angry, or when Vyvanse starts kicking in ""too fast"", my emotional state is completely wiped and I feel empty/depressed/unmotivated/asocial almost instantly

For example, when my fingers start getting cold/mood starts becoming content from Vyvanse, I'll subsequently feel a sharp decline in mood & my fingers warm up again 

The threshold for this is rising day by day, but how long did it take for Intuniv/Guanfacine to leave your system?",1,"depressive symptoms, fatigue, ##motivated, asocial, decline in mood"
"Intuniv made me not give a shit about anything & hate everyone; it pushed me into the worst depression I've ever had in my life

It's been 15 days since discontinuing it & I still feel it in my system when I take my Vyvanse; I don't even have the energy to pretend to care about things sometimes, & still get slow/sleepy if I get too excited about something

"I really hope to find a good advice for my situation, every advice is appreciated!

Im a 21 year old guy, and currently ""studying"" (Well not quite) at university. I got diagnosed 4 months ago and began my jouney on Ritalin La and the short version as well under the Novartis brand name.

At my unmedicated state i always reached the absolute minimum requirements by hyperfocusing at the last minute with heavy anxiety (and also i suppose, social anxiety). On the positive side, i was also very social and friendly, which made me think im a shy/anxious extrovert if that make sense . Starting off ritalin La at 20mg/day, i was convinced that i will take over the world. With the reduced impulsivity and increased attention i asked to top up my dose beacuse it wasnt enough, i felt like i need to be cover my symptoms at all day.

A month later the university came around, and i quickly found myself losing control in my anxiety and perfectionism. I struggled on every dose, if i took 20mg i had laserfocus for 2 hours then i couldnt function at this high dose, and when i took 5-12.5mg i wasnt anxious but  i felt like undermedicated. There was no sweet middle spot, the dose was to high or too low( time and tolerance didnt help much). My anxiety was so high, that i couldnt help it, and it led me to avoid socialization and university as much as possible. At this point my psychiatrist presribed Mirtazapine (15mg) which ALLOWED me to sleep and eat at my evenings. It worked for 2 weeks for sleep, but not much with daytime activity,  after 2 weeks i had all of the same issue. 

Fast forward to about 2 months later, i picked up the ER version of the guanfacine (1mg at morning, and later an additional 1mg at night). Basically there is no sweet spot in here as well. It either decreased my pulse and anxiety and made Ritalin crash nonexistent( at 1.5-2mg), which is awesome but it removed my big impulses as well (the need to eat,drink,study,shower). On the low end at 1mg, the effects disappeared 2-3 days later.

&#x200B;

I know therapy, yoga, exercising is a thing, but i cant bring myself to do them yet beacuse of my high anxiety or from the guanfacine making me sit all day. My best bet from an objective view would be to make a switch towards to a low dose ritalin, escitalopram (lexapro), Wellbutrin combination. What do you think? If you had a somewhat similiar experience or have an advice, i would appreciate it!",1,high anxiety
"I took Intuniv/Guanfacine for a little over a month, and my girlfriend found that in addition to making me depressed/irritable, it also induced child-like behavior as the days went on

I realized that I could pin these behaviors to specific eras in my life, (I'm currently a college student); it's almost like I was aging backwards linearly

I was highschool-like in the first week, and then my personality progressed to how I was in middle school, then elementary, etc.

I discontinued the Intuniv around a month ago, and am experiencing the same phenomenon in reverse. Does anyone have a plausible theory as to how/why this could occur?

I know it uniquely acts on improving prefrontal cortex connectivity, but I don't know where to go from there",1,"##rritable, child - like behavior"
"I've been on Straterra for 6 months now and while it has surprisingly helped so much with my ADHD, I've recently come to terms with how much of an emotionless robot I've been. I want to try intuniv or another nonstimulant but I'm afraid they'll all make me emotionally numb.

If you are on or were on intuniv did it make you feel emotionally numb? 

I've heard Intuniv can help with emotional regulation, can anyone compare this to Straterra?

Do you have any recommendations for nonstimulants that don't cause emotional bluntness? (I can't do stimulants anymore :/ addiction)

"I've been on Intuniv for 5 days. Since taking it, I've felt so weak, tired, irritable, and dizzy. I was curious about my BP so I've been checking it with my dad's blood pressure monitor for the past few days and it has been 90/60, sometimes slightly higher sometimes slightly lower. I even checked it after doing an hour of cardio and it was like 80 something over 50, which seems kind of low to me. Usually, my blood pressure is around 110/70.

I'm going to talk to my doctor about it but I don't know if I'm overthinking it. Is this normal? Does it go away?",1,"tired, irritable, dizzy"
"I'm on day 4 of Intuniv for ADHD and anxiety. So far, it makes me extremely tired and drowsy! I also feel so foggy and like my ADHD is even worse which is not ideal. I started having really bad anxiety again yesterday after feeling like Intuniv was helping for the first couple of days. I also just got my period, which causes a lot of mental effects, so hopefully, it is just from that.

Idk if it is just making my blood pressure too low? I checked with my dad's blood pressure cuff and my BP hovers over 90/60. My apple watch also shows that my heart rate is much lower compared to usual. I really don't want to have to stop taking it because stimulants alone give me way too much anxiety.

When do Intuniv side effects usually go away?",1,"tired, drowsy, foggy, adhd"
"Hi everyone! I take Vyvanse and Intuniv. I am on my 4th day. The reason why I take Intuniv, is because I experience emotional blunting, anxiety, high heart-rate and high blood-pressure when taking Vyvanse alone.

So far, within an hour after taking Intuniv, I no longer experience emotional blunting, and I experience reduced anxiety, and a decrease in heart-rate, blood pressure and anxiety, which is good.

The negatives are that it seems to reduce the effect of Vyvanse. Within an hour of taking Intuniv, I experience decreased happiness, (which is different from) tiredness, worsening of concentration and working memory, decreased ability to organize, prioritize and plan.

My question is primarily for those of you who have taken intuniv for a while and experience alleviation of ADHD-symptoms.

Did intuniv worsen the effect of your other ADHD-medication (if you did polytherapy), or worsen your ADHD-symptoms before you saw a an improvement of ADHD-symptoms?",1,"emotional blunting, anxiety, high heart - rate, high blood - pressure, emotional blunting, anxiety, decrease in heart - rate, blood pressure, anxiety, decreased happiness, tiredness, worsening of concentration and working memory, ##hd - symptoms"
"I’ve been on vyvanse (70mg) for about 6 months and it’s been incredible. My focus, drive, executive function etc have all been so much better, plus my binge eating was so much better. 
After a month or two, I started struggling a bit in the afternoons so my psych prescribed guanfacine to help. The first few weeks were great, and he slowly increased my dose to 4mg which was fine at the time. 
I started struggling again in the afternoons so my psych recommended a day or two off vyvanse every week to stop my body getting used to it. This was great and it felt much more effective but the payback was sleeping the entire day I didn’t take vyvanse - I mean I’d sleep 8 hours at night, have 3 x 3 hour naps during the day then sleep another 8 hours that night. This was ok though because it made the other days in my week so productive. 
I started feeling really sleepy at work (falling asleep sitting upright in a chair several times, struggling to keep my eyes open) so I went down from 4mg guanfacine to 3mg. That was ok for a while but now I’m feeling the same effects. Falling asleep at work, getting home from work and falling asleep on the couch for a few hours before putting myself to bed and sleeping another 8 hours. It’s no longer helping my productivity because I’m simply so tired all the time! I thought it was because I was so busy but work has settled down and I’m still uncontrollably tired. Also because of the fatigue my binge eating is back too

TLDR: guanfacine was great in the beginning but now I can barely keep my eyes open during the day despite sleeping & napping 11+ hours a day. 

Has anyone else experienced this???",1,
"Hi, a little background to my question:

I (f33) was on methylphenidate up until at the end of last year, when it just didn't have an effect anymore. Me and my doctor tried a higher dose, but all it got me was side effects which persisted even when we lowered the dose again. At spring this year we switched to Vyvanse, with great success. I've never felt so ""normal"" in my life, so calm, focused and at ease. My memory worked properly, my anxiety was more or less gone entirely, and everything just felt like it should. Of course there has been side effects of lost appetite, but I manage it with routines.

I started on 30 mg, then went on to 40 mg (after trying 50, which was too much at the time). After a while the effect started to subside, and the ADHD started to kick in more and more. Now I take an extra 20 mg around lunch time to prolong the effects, but as me and my doctor discussed, I seem to metabolise the medicine fairly quickly once my body gets used to it. Before it gets used to it, I'm very sensitive to increasing the dosage. Now the effect starts to be less and less effective after the afternoon. 

I have researched other treatments over months and found that guanfacine seems to have a good effect on ADHD, and since my effect of ADHD makes me have a more or less constant surge of adrenaline, I thought it could be a good fit. Since some researchers find that combined therapies has great effects, I proposed this idea to my doctor. He said that usually one ought to try Strattera before guanfacine (at least in the country that I live in), but since I'm scared of trying Strattera from previous experiences of SNRI, we could try intuniv if I prefer. I know Strattera is not the same as SNRI, but since it's still an NRI I feel very cautious. He said, however, that it is usually used when people have an increase in blood pressure as a side effect of stimulants. And my blood pressure has barely moved on neither methylphenidate nor Vyvanse, staying steady around 116/68ish. 

Maybe the background was unnecessary for the question, but if not I thought it could be nice to have it in whole instead of scattered in the comments.

So to get back to the question, have anyone started on guanfacine (with or without Vyvanse/methylphenidate) while having normal blood pressure? If yes, what was your experience regarding both effect on ADHD but mostly your blood pressure?",1,"lost appetite, ##hd, increase in blood pressure, on adhd, your blood pressure"
"So my new psychiatrist is starting me on guanfacine. He mentioned that if it makes me sleepy/etc.  we may try adding a more stimulating med. He also said that it energises some people. I've had a bad history of stimulants (anxiety, metabolism) so I'm kind of hoping that guanfacine itself will be enough. But from what I gather, intuniv hasn't really helped that many people with 'focus' and sustained effort, which is my biggest ADHD thing. After the ten minute mark I usually become disinterested with any activity. Can intuniv help this for some people?",1,disinterested
"I (18f) was diagnosed with adhd a couple of years ago but started medication this past summer. I was started on 20mg of vyvanse but could not tolerate the side effects. My heart was pounding, I had headaches and this was after at least a month of consistent medication use. I spoke to my family doctor and was switched to intuniv which has been really helpful in a lot of ways (motivation, emotional regulation, impulsivity, and surprisingly anxiety) however one of the big ways it hasn’t made much of an impact on is my focus. I still cannot sit through an hour long lecture and recorded lectures are even worse. I’m at 3mg of intuniv now so my doctor and I don’t think increasing my dose is going to help my focus which is why she’s recommended possibly adding wellbutrin with my intuniv and I was wondering if anyone had tried this combo before or any general advice is also welcome.

"Hi all.

I was on intuniv for three months for adhd. It made me constantly exhausted and didn't do much for me. While I was on it I went from 134 pounds to 140. I'm 5'7 and have always stayed around 125-130something without having to put in much effort. This is the heaviest I'd ever been so once I began weaning off I started cleaning up my diet, reducing alcohol and exercising regularly again.  I've been off it two and a half weeks now and switched to Wellbutrin. I assumed coming off intuniv and starting exercising again and eating better the weight gained from it would easily fall off but its actually steadily been increasing. I've gone up another 2-3 pounds since stopping and I'm so confused. I would normally be losing weight with what I'm doing. Also it isn't just that day and a fluke as I've been keeping an eye on my weight almost daily hoping that it'll just drop one day and I can blame the new gain on water retention. Anyway, if anyone has any personal experiences about weight gain/loss after stopping intuniv or another anti depressant I would love to hear your personal anecdotes.

"Hey all,

&#x200B;

I was excited to see my neurologist today because I was hoping to try out a new medication or maybe put back on Vyvanse.  While that medication kept me up for 24hours, it was like a super drug.  I was doing everything while on Vyvanse: folding clothes as soon as the dryer stopped, varnishing the table because I had an urge to varnish a table, trying to fix a computer...  Anyway, I would love to give it another try but unfortunately, due to my new schizo-like symptoms that my neurologist believes is caused by Adderall, (which I do not doubt at all) he prescribed me Intuniv ER instead because it's a non-stimulant.  I saw a couple of threads about Intuniv experiences and it looks like it does not help with focus but it relieves a lot anxiety and helps provide 'clearer' thinking.  I was wondering if I can get new input from those who are currently on it alone without a stimulant.  Thanks.

"TL;DR: Combo of Intuniv (for emotional regulation) and Dex (for ADHD symptoms) seemed to be the golden ticket for balanced efficacy, at first - but now seems to be a side-effects, anxiety-filled nightmare!

Anyone have similar experiences or insights into why this might be?

More detail:

I trialled Strattera when I was first diagnosed, but no useful effect.

I then trialled both Dexedrine (IR) and Vyvanse (ER) (not simultaneously, of course, and naturally with guidance and supervision from my doctor) over about 8 months since my ADHD diagnosis last year.

Dexedrine was effective but only lasted 3 hrs.

Vyvanse was good but only lasted around 5 hrs, except at higher doses where they lasted 10 hrs. Looking back, Vyvanse wasn’t as good for my EF as Dex, and I think it caused some anxiety/mood swings as side effects, particularly at higher doses (even when those higher doses were beneficial for ADHD symptoms).

I landed back on Dex after thinking Vyvanse might have been a problem. Has been positive for my core ADHD symptoms.

However, I’ve been trying to figure out how to juggle my core ADHD symptoms (focus, brain fog, scattiness, motivation) alongside the emotional lability/spiky nervous system I experience (frustration, overwhelm).

Earlier on, I tried a low dose SSRI + Dex combo (for PMDD symptoms) which didn’t help. I stopped the SSRI.

I started Intuniv (Guanfacine) (ER) 1mg about six weeks ago, alongside Dex 10-15mg. At first, it seemed to be going beautifully. I felt like my nervous system was less spiky, things rolled off my back more, I was more centred in myself, less flappable, marginally more attentive even without Dex, and I became much less impulsive. Fabulous.

Over the past couple of weeks, though, I’ve been feeling increasingly anxious - which I wasn’t at all the case previously.

This anxious feeling manifested as a strange, fairly subtle sense of anxiety (in the gut, as well as a feeling that “something wasn’t quite right with the world”) after my Dex kicked in. I shrugged it off as a mild niggle, because it wasn’t debilitating - just odd.

It gradually got worse, until about two weeks ago, where most days I would end up in a vicious anxious/panicked state after taking Dex - sick to my stomach, teary, flat, feeling utterly miserable and like everything in my life was going to pieces. Wiped out, lethargic, had to lie on the couch and weep. Gradually, I also started feeling more and more scrambled in the brain even after taking Dex (so pretty much little to no help for ADHD symptoms anymore).

After cottoning on to the fact that it was probably Dex not playing nicely alongside Intuniv, I skipped Dex altogether yesterday. My emotions were perfect, but my brain was a mushy bowl of pea soup, and it was deeply unpleasant to try and accomplish anything. (What is this rusty brain?!) I couldn’t scrape my thoughts together at all.

(NB: I had never had such feelings taking Dex BEFORE starting Intuniv).

So today I thought, okay, I will try taking a 10mg dose of Dex instead of 15mg. I had a glimmer of it seeming to work cognitively. Not long afterwards, the anxiety and low mood hit me like a truck again. Now I’m an emotional puddle on the couch.

I am pretty confident that it’s not a tolerance to Dex - this has all come about specifically in relationship with Intuniv. Having realised this, I know I’m likely going to have to dump the Intuniv after seeing my doctor, and stick with Dex so I can function cognitively. But it’s sad, because Intuniv did initially seem to offer some nice support as well.

"I personally had a negative experience with guanfacine for a few reasons. It can lower your blood pressure, and for me that made me EXTREMELY tired and dropped my BP into the 40s at some points. Its impulse control methodology basically makes your reward pathways less responsive, and for me that made me extremely unmotivated and depressed in a way I had never felt before. I took guanfacine for two months & am diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD for reference. I thought maybe these side effects would go away with time, so I took all the pills prescribed to me.

There are some people on Reddit with positive experiences, including people who couple guanfacine with stimulants! :] I hope it is a better experience for you, and if not then I hope hearing my experience makes you feel less alone.

"Around a year ago, I took Tenex ( instant release ) at .5mg (was given 1mg but I halved them) with dextroamphetamine 3 times daily. I would then take 1mg 1 hour before bed.   


At time time I was trying many anti depressants as my depression was worsening, and I wanted a low does during the day because I didn't want any of those 2-4% side effects I had read about.   


However within a month even at that low dose, I think it really helped, sadly I had to stop taking it because of some interactions with an antidepressant I tried, and I just now am attempting to resume use.   
I had no luck with antidepressants, but eventually tried ECT, and it was vey successful, so the first thing I am going to try is ER at night with my current ADHD medicine (Lisdexamfetamine)  


I will also be trying my IR routine, with 3 a day dextroamphetamine to see how it works after ECT, as before I think depression really stiffened of the benefits that Guanfacine gave to aid in the fight against ADHD.   


I will update what I find out, but I can say, I would of absolutely lost my job at once point if not for the combination, I ultimately lost my job on a ""leave to deal with insomnia from the worsening depression"" because I didnt check my snail mail. (Walmart.. yeah Ill rat them out)  


However, that was a blessing in disguise, because while it took nearly a year, I do not believe I would of been able to afford ECT without state funded healthcare. I am very optimistic about my future now, including the potential benefits of Guanfacine now that it doesn't have to fight the anxiety and nervous ticks of my depression.

"I saw a post from you from a few months ago where you gave quite a praise to guanfacine. I'm really curious if you think that was placebo, or if the effects were truly there but waned (extra curious about the perfect pitch). Could it be that you titrated too quickly? It seems that there is little agreement among doctors as to what the dosages and titration schedules should be (a natural consequence of the lack of FDA approval for adults, I guess). I'm wondering if it takes longer to build cumulative effects than people realize and titrating too quickly results in good effects at first, but then the dose becomes overwhelming.

I'm on 3mg myself at the moment, titrated from 1 and 2 over the course of 3 weeks.

"This worries me because I just started this but I have also been on lithium for years, and it takes the luster from everything and puts you in a constant neutral state.

"Just a couple thoughts. First, I'm not sure whether the stimulants actually do work primarily through dopamine. The papers I've read on this seem to say that it's a fascinating mystery that they're still trying to unravel (when it comes to the role of DA and NE). See here, for example, but this is just one point of view of course so don't take this as necessarily being the case: 

>It is widely accepted that ADHD drugs reduce its core symptoms by potentiating catecholaminergic signalling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC; Arnsten 2009; Arnsten and Pliszka 2011; Berridge and Devilbiss 2011; Sharma and Couture 2014; Heal and Pierce 2006; Heal et al. 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013a) and the major driver of the effect is through a norepinephrine-based mechanism. The PFC has sparse and diffuse dopaminergic innervation, but it is the low density of DAT sites (Hitri et al. 1991; Sesack et al. 1998) and their inefficient clearance of synaptic dopamine (Cass and Gerhardt 1995; Sesack et al. 1998; Mundorf et al. 2001) that results in a substantial proportion of released dopamine being transported into norepinephrine-releasing neuronal terminals via NET sites (Morón et al. 2002; Stahl 2003). Blockade of PFC NET sites by norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors increases extracellular concentrations of both norepinephrine and dopamine (Gresch et al. 1995; Bymaster et al. 2002; Swanson et al. 2006; Yu et al. 2020). In contrast, selective blockade of DAT sites in the PFC has little impact on synaptic dopamine or norepinephrine concentrations (Tanda et al. 1997). Through their inhibitory and autoreceptor actions, α2-adrenoceptor agonists actually decrease the exocytotic release of norepinephrine and dopamine in the PFC (Gresch et al. 1995; Tanda et al. 1996) and yet are effective in treating the disorder. Clear evidence that DAT is not a critical effector of efficacy in ADHD is illustrated by the weak efficacy of bupropion in clinical trials (see Heal et al. 2012) and discontinuation of several drug-candidates that preferentially enhance dopaminergic neurotransmission (see Table 2).

Second, the idea of ""top-down control"" is a huge thing if you read Dr. Arnsten's work. So I wouldn't be too shocked if a stimulant helped. I'm not saying that this is the case, but it wouldn't be weird for me to think that the stimulant created ""top-down control"" and that this helped with your depression and anxiety. See here: 

https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/9/5/113

>Anatomical tracing studies in monkeys [38] indicate that dlPFC may be able to regulate BA25 through indirect connections via areas BA10m and BA32 (Figure 1A). Human imaging studies suggest these connections may be important in regulating stress and depression, as dlPFC functional connectivity correlates with that of vmPFC BA32 as subjects overcome their response to stress [35], and as activity in this “medial corridor” is related to a sustained anti-depressant response to deep brain stimulation [39]. Furthermore, the antidepressant effects of TMS to strengthen the left dlPFC have been related to its ability to reduce the activity of BA25 [40], supporting the circuit model shown in Figure 1. Conversely, dlPFC and medial PFC deactivate during uncontrollable stress (Figure 1B), as described below. The loss of top-down control by the dlPFC and rostral circuits with stress has been of special interest, as these newly evolved circuits are especially vulnerable in neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, they have been a focus of neurobiological research.",1,

Last week I decided to stop taking it. A day or two after I stopped I started getting withdrawal symptoms like dizziness and weird heartbeat (I don't think it was faster than normal, but it would randomly have a few seconds of being more ""intense"") and sweating all over my body. I took my medication again a day after this started and kept taking it for a couple days. Then I tried again and the same thing happened so I just started taking it again.

I have a bottle and a half left so I have some time, but when it runs out I'm not going to be able to get a new one. I'm not sure what to do to wean myself off of it. I looked it up and it sounds like you can't cut pills because of the slow-release mechanism so I can't slowly reduce my dosage.

I can handle withdrawal effects if I have to but I'm worried about having a serious medical problem from it.

My son has officially been diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive) after three years of every teacher/speech therapist/reading interventionist saying his biggest obstacle is inability to focus. 

But now that we discuss medication, my husband is pushing back hard.  We both don’t want to go the stimulant route. We are looking at Strattera or Intuniv. But husband won’t agree until he knows more about long term impacts on brain development. 

Any psychiatrists/neurologists/MD able to weigh in?

I just now decided to use them again. My pharmacist said that they are ok to take together and it won't cause harm. I take intuniv at night. Can I tske them st the same time tonight and continuously to help me sleep? I've been sleeping 2-4 hours a night and it's not helping my anxiety and tics along with making it harder to function.",1,

Recent bloodwork: CBC and CMP (mostly normal; slight elevations in liver values that are normal for me, slight decrease in kidney function likely due to a recent kidney stone; normal glucose + normal a1c last time that was tested earlier this year ), Vitamin D (normal), vitamin B12 (normal)

I’m hesitant to call it numbness because I still have sensation in my legs but it feels off. Temperature especially is weird I notice in the shower but my legs feel constantly like I’m wearing socks or something. Like they’re being lightly touched all the time. Occasionally I get small spikes of pain in my feet.

I’ve had this issue in my feet for months but over the last few weeks it’s slowly seemed to move upward and at this point I’m feeling it up to my knees. Sometimes random patches of skin feel fuzzy/like they’re asleep.

I had an initial doctors appointment about this last month with a nurse who ordered tests for B12 and vitamin D and also posited it could be anxiety or my Vyvanse (I’ve been taking my Vyvanse for over a year now, I don’t know if it would suddenly start causing a reaction like this). Both tests came out normal and she didn’t recommend any follow-up. I called today to try to schedule something and apparently my doctors office is now booked solid until late September, and I’m starting a new job in mid-September and likely won’t be able to get time off until October at least unless my symptoms get much worse.

I’m not sure what I should do next. I think my symptoms point to neuropathy of some kind but that seems to be caused by a million different things including potentially cancer which is my big fear naturally. Is there anything I can do besides just hoping it doesn’t get worse while I wait for an appointment in October? Does this seem urgent?",1,

"Hi!

There is a comparison picture in the comment to show you what I mean. 


I’ve been on Ozempic for a year and have lost 50 lbs. 
I haven’t had any bad side effects except from constipation and even at the my most constipated, I didn’t swell up like this. 

But in the past one or two weeks, I’ve just exploded. I look like I have’t lost any weight whatsoever. 

——


**Personal and medical info:**

- F34, lives in Sweden. 5’8”, 174lbs. 

- Current diagnoses: ADHD, depression, PCOS, hypothyroidism 

- Current medications: Ozempic, Metformin, spironolactone, Vyvanse, Cymbalta, Seroquel (for sleep), Intuniv, bisoprolol, levithyroxine 

- Lifestyle: very sedentary, currently unemployed, not a great diet 
—-

Overall, Ozempic has worked very well for me. The only real issues have been very low blood pressure at times (at one point 62/48) and we’ve lowered the dose of spironolactone several times which has helped. 

I have been constipated a lot, but that is nothing unusual for me. Even before I could easily go a week between bowel movements with no ill effects. 

I *am* constipated now, I haven’t had bm in about six days. 

I spoke to my Ozempic doc yesterday who was a bit dismissive. 

All she said was “that’s strange.”

She prescribed me Orlistat which apparently might help with constipation. 


—-

And it probably is just that, it’s just that there’s such a dramatic difference between now and a month ago.  

I don’t think I have any general fluid build up, my arms and legs look the same. I am gassy. 

I doubt I’ve gained 50 lbs of fat in a month. 

I’m definitely not pregnant, unless there has been some divine intervention. 😅

The *ONLY* thing I can think of is that I’ve been eating pasta for pretty much every meal. I don’t have celiac’s and I’m skeptical towards non-celiac gluten intolerance but that’s the only thing I’ve been doing differently. 

I’m obviously going to stop eating pasta for a while and keep on top of the constipation.

Should I be worried? Could there be a “real” problem?


Thank you in advance 💐

medications include: >!zoloft 150mg (depression/mood), naltrexone 25mg (sh urges), metoprolol 100mg (tachycardia), amitriptyline 10mg (stomach pain, IBS symptoms), remeron 15mg (sleep), intuniv 2mg (adhd) are all taken daily, uribel 81.6mg (bladder symptoms) supposed to be taken daily, but i tend to skip it a couple times a week. zofran for nausea prn (rarely taken and idk the dose, but it's the standard dose). no otc's. i have been on most of these meds for years and my doctor and I both agree my meds are stable and helpful. i vape, but my tolerance is low so i'd definitely consider myself a light (but regular) user.!<

history: >!diagnosis of depression, anxiety, ptsd, adhd. diagnosis of neurogenic bladder (mainly overactive, possible underactive too), ""tachycardia"" (i'm positive it's pots and possibly ist. i received a pots diagnosis but it's not officially recognized by my docs), IBS, !<pnes (i personally refer to them as just non epileptic seizures, i hate ""psychogenic"" as it makes people think i'm faking or it's just stress/psychological \[which my doctor(s) believe and to be clear, I don't\]), abnormality of gait and mobility not otherwise specified (I have leg weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus. bc of my legs I use a wheelchair and crutches. I've been in PT since this started back in nov 2022). I have a lot of back pain/problems which I think is connected. I've been to a chiropractor and they told me I have flat feet, a lot of tension/stress in my vertebrae mainly at my neck and lower back, and my posture and stuff is messed up. My chiropractor said it's likely I have hEDS and it could be causing nerve problems which could be the cause of my legs, bladder, pots, etc.

before I continue I want to be clear I have undiagnosed conditions and symptoms such as >!HSD/hEDS (my drs recognize my hypermobility and joint symptoms, but no diagnosis), tics (probably very mild to mild tourettes \[i've had tics since i was little\]), GI problems including food sensitivities, constipation, stomach pain, possible gastroparesis, etc I also have severe CFS/ME which I'm currently in the process of getting diagnosed!<

my pnes and abnormality diagnosis are just specifications of FND (which my drs recognize). my FND causes seizures, dystonia, and other symptoms. I think there is a possibility I don't actually have FND at all, but I accept my seizures and etc as FND if I do have it. 

COMPLAINT: I started having severe weakness and trouble walking after seizures, and back in nov 2022 after a seizure I couldn't walk at all and started using a wheelchair full time. my pcp ran a blood test to ensure I didn't have any deficiencies, infections, or gullian-barre. after that was clear she sent me to see my neurologist. neurologist said it's just a part of my FND and sent me off to pt with zero tests whatsoever. I've been in pt ever since, and I made really good progress the first 6 months to where I could walk with crutches quite well, but I still couldn't stand unassisted. at that time I was able to walk at a normal pace with just one crutch and my only need for my wheelchair came from my pots and cfs/me symptoms. after the first 6 months my progress completely slowed and since then my legs have further progressed. I now drag my toes when I walk, and it's very hard to lift my feet to clear the floor. My ankles give at every step, and my spasticity is severe. I'm making very little progress, if any at all.

My PT recently started doing traction on my back where she puts a sheet under my back and slowly pulls on it so it stretches my back out. The first time she was doing it my left leg was spasming pretty bad because my spasms get triggered by too much movement. As she was doing it we noticed my spasms slowed down until it went away. I go once a week and we do it about every other week. Yesterday she had a student with her and did a clonus test on me to teach the student, and allowed the student to practice. The way my clonus presents isn't like a simple repeated tapping motion, but my foot completely dorsiflexes, toes curl up, and it's like I'm flooring the gas pedal. My knees also spasm and cause me to kick, but it can also completely lock up so my leg is fully extended and my foot is pointing down. It's way worse in my left than my right side. My right leg has always been the stronger one, but not by a whole lot. I'm left-handed if that matters (idk if people naturally have a stronger leg). We did traction after the test, my legs calmed down, and my PT did the test again. I had a some clonus in my feet but it was mild and I had almost no spasms in my knees. We were both shocked it almost went completely away.

My spasms can get triggered just by things like stretching, straightening my leg, standing up, etc. Sometimes also by nothing. Right now my left foot is kinda curling my toes, pointing down, but then letting go and repeating. My spasms can get so severe I completely have to use my wheelchair and my legs will just spasm for HOURS. It's incredibly painful and there's nothing I can do to make it stop. Since the beginning of this (and even before) I've had hyperreflexia, and minor spasms caused by reflex testing. Then I developed severe spasms from reflex testing, and I started getting spasms after too much PT or movement. I went from having no issues with my legs (except hyperreflexia) to severe weakness, developing progressive spasticity and clonus that's become severe, possible foot drop, with muscle weakness that got somewhat better but quickly went away and has not returned.

I fully do not believe my leg problems are caused by FND. I definitely believe FND is real and can cause muscle weakness or paralysis, but my issues seem to have a genuine connection to my nerves and back. There is definitely something pathological going on, and my PT's are upset with the lack of answers from my neurologist. I'm planning to switch to a new one soon, but I'm looking at over a year. My neurologist has seen my spasms, knows I'm hyperreflexive, and etc. She knows I've seen a chiropractor and we showed her the results of like the tension on my back, my flat feet, my messed up posture and etc. She knows I get a pinched nerve feeling sometimes and it can make my whole leg go completely numb.

I'm not sure if I count as having foot drop as I'm technically able to lift my toes while I'm sitting for just a second but it takes several seconds, I lift them for a split second before I lose the strength, and it can trigger spasms. I'm able to move my feet up and down by my ankles while I'm sitting, but when I'm walking it's really hard to get enough strength out of my quads to lift my leg enough to make my foot clear the floor, and then lift my toes. I can't lift my toes properly and I'm only able to clear the floor with my foot by walking very slowly. I have to focus on lifting my leg enough to clear my toes, and then move my foot forward. I don't and can't lift my toes while walking, I lift my leg high enough to make my foot clear the floor, but it's still pointing downwards and to get my heel to land first I have to curl my toes, and push down with my heel so it barely lands right before my toes.

Because of the way I walk like that I only do it at PT as it's very slow and time consuming. I often fail to completely clear the floor with my toes, as I often kinda ""stutter"" and hit the floor a few times with my toes while swinging my leg through a step. I'm capable of lifting my big toe if I curl all my toes and then lift it individually, but the rest of my toes spasm doing that.

 I'm desperate for any ideas because how could FND cause clonus and spasticity, and then it almost completely going away after lower spinal decompression? Plus with the gradual worsening before becoming a wheelchair user, then making good progress but completely plateau'ing, and then going completely downhill to developing spasticity, clonus, and possible foot drop that all became severe? I've been doing PT for almost 2 years and yet I'm slowly getting worse. I now can only walk around the house and from the car inside to appointments. I am using my wheelchair full time at school and anytime I go out in public that's not to an appointment, like the store or out with friends. (aka anywhere that I have to stand or walk more than 50 feet) I'm starting to use my wheelchair more and more at home as well. Something else has to be wrong. Please give me any ideas or advice, even if it's far-fetched or unlikely.

I've gone to two ENTs and they said everything looks fine, but the pain some days is so excruciating. I have no idea what it is!

My next step is asking for an MRI of my ear. It started out after I had what I thought was a pimple around my incisura (I definitely googled ear anatomy because I wouldn't have been able to tell you that location myself) and I popped it. Maybe it was a cyst. But since then, it started as just ear cartilage pain, now it feels like my left ear canal is tight, or at least tighter than my right ear canal, and is really hurting. The only way I can sleep at night is on my side, so I had to get one of those ear pillows with the hole in them just so I can alternate which side I sleep on. I can't put any pressure on my ear at all. It looks normal, but has appeared red in the past.

Any help would be appreciated, I'm worried it could be a bigger problem since they can't find anything and I have to deal with this pain every day",1,ear
"Our son is 8 (no diagnosed health conditions) . He's very clearly had ADHD (inattentive) since kindergarten but we've tried helping him keep up in school with reading intervention, speech, resource, and tutoring. But he's steadily falling more behind. We had a meeting with the psychologist, speech therapist, reading interventionist, resource teacher, school nurse, and his teacher after they did a full psychoeducational evaluation.
He now officially qualifies for special education and is, across the board, testing at mid first grade level. He's currently in his last month of second grade. All of the evaluations say his inability to focus is the biggest issue.
I convinced my husband that we explore all options, including the medical route with an official ADHD diagnosis. He agreed. But now that we discuss medication, he has a hard "" I'm not drugging my kid"" and
""we aren't putting him on speed"". I've told him there are non-stimulant options available now. But he's still holding firm that drugs are the lazy way out of something we can fix on our own. The only suggestion he's provided for fixing it on our own is to provide him with a better study environment (which I already do by completely clearing the counter, moving the other spinning chairs, asking his sister to hang out in the other room, eliminating all noise, and making sure he's not hungry), but even with this, he can focus for about 30 seconds.

Some specific concerns he's expressed are the impact of drugs (we are looking at Strattera and Intuniv) on a developing brain and nervous system and general distrust of the American pharmaceutical industry not having the best interest of people. I've showed him that the EU, Australia, and Japan have all approved Strattera and Intuniv for use in children.

We have an appt with his pediatrician tomorrow to discuss medication options. But I know he will just dismiss it all and say a pediatrician isn't knowledgeable enough on long term impacts on the brain. So I was hoping to get some input from other doctors who maybe have more experience with the long term neurological/nervous system impact of non-stimulant meds on children.

My son does not have diabetes (no family history of diabetes), is not overweight and eats a relatively well-balanced diet with lots of fruits and veggies – the only NAFLD “risk” box he checks is sedentary lifestyle, as his activities outside of school have decreased a lot over the past three years due to worsening pain and fatigue.  I also have two relatives (paternal uncle and one of his children) who have had genetic testing done and supposedly carry the gene for hemochromatosis, but aren't symptomatic and haven't required treatment.  My son's fatigue, allodynia and suspected neuropathy pain have all been getting worse over the past year, and I am fearful that we are passing the point that some of these issues – and NAFLD - could be reversed if he were to receive timely treatment.   


My son has been on the waitlist to see a gastroenterologist/hepatologist for 3.5 years now (for suspected IBS/IBD), and I have already called and let their office know about the ultrasound results in the hopes that it bumps his referral up the list.  We do have access to a pediatrician, and he is very kind, but our appointments are brief (>5 minutes) and spaced far apart, so I like to plan discussion points out ahead of time to make the best use of our time.  


**We have an appointment with his pediatrician at the end of the month, and I am looking for direction on questions to ask or tests to request which may help narrow down the “root cause” behind some of these symptoms.  I would imagine he will be tested for hepatitis (since his ALT level more than doubled in less than a year), but what else should I request he be tested for?  Mono?  Eppstein-Barr?  Cholesterol and TSAT levels?**  Also, would it be appropriate to request a referral to a cardiologist?  Or to suggest B12 injections since so many of my son’s symptoms overlap with B12 deficiency and functional B12 deficiency is possible in patients with IBS/IBD?  I don’t want to irritate his doctor and get “hysterical mother with Munchausen by proxy” added to my son’s medical file, but I also want to advocate for him before these losses in function get even worse. 

Or is this a situation where he really shouldn't wait a month until that appointment for additional tests to be done?  If that is the case, we can try a walk-in doctor next week to see if they'd be willing to order further testing.  


Thank you to anyone who took the time to read through this all and help a stressed parent out! ",1,"##aundice, stomach, di, thumping, heart, allodynia, ##uropathy"

CC: cat bite on left forearm 2 days ago

PMH: ADD (adderall ER 30 mg, intuniv ER 1 mg), allergic rhinitis (cetirizine 10 mg), ibuprofen (800 mg)

Alcohol/Tobacco/Illicit drug: occasional drinker (1 can of beer once a week), no tobacco or illicit drug use

I got bitten by my cat (up to date on 3 yr dose of rabies - due 10/2023) on Tuesday. Immediately ran under water for few minutes and washed with mild soap. Bleeding stopped shortly after. I'm currently in nursing school and fortunately had my clinical rotation in the ED the next day, so a PA took a look at the wound. She prescribed me Augmentin 875 mg/125 mg BID for 10 days and I got a bottle of Hibiclens to wash the site with. Also marked the redness yesterday to see if spreads more. I experienced some pain at the wound site and very mild tingling down in my fingers yesterday, but the PA recommended to take ibuprofen and watch signs of cellulitis, and recommended to come back to the ED if I develop fever.

I washed the site with Hibiclens and took the first dose of augmentin today around 1 pm since I slept in and that's when I ate first meal of the day. The site is still red, warm to touch, some swelling presenting, some puss forming around the bigger wounds, mild pain to move. But I started feeling more constant tingling and numbness down in my hand, mainly the left thumb and pinky finger which has been going on for 2 hours now and gradually becoming more noticeable along with mild nausea. I did feel a bit of left eye twitching about an hour ago, but I'm not sure if it's a coincidental thing. No fever.

I called my insurance nurse triage line and explained the symptoms and how much of augmentin I took. The RN recommended me to go to the ED for medical care now because she's concerned of numbness and tingling and nausea. However considering I've only taken only one dose of augmentin, I'm hesitant go to the ED right away, especially with no signs of fever.

I know to go to the ED if I develop fever, but would tingling/numbness normal for possible cellulitis and appropriate reason to go to the ED? Should I watch more after taking the second dose of augmentin tonight to make a decision? Any advices/recommendations would be much appreciated. Thank you.",1,"eye twitch, numbness, tingling, fever, tingling, numbness"

"My 8yo daughter has a UTI that isn’t responding well to amoxicillin. She developed symptoms on Thursday night and saw her GP on Friday. The urine was cultured and showed that it was an E.coli infection sensitive to all antibiotics. She was prescribed amoxicillin 250mg 2x daily, which she started taking on Friday night.

It’s now Tuesday night and she says she’s still having pain on urination. I spoke to a Telehealth clinic who said to check for signs of thrush (I checked and there’s no redness at all), and if that was clear to increase her dosage to 250mg 3x daily and go back to the GP in five days to get another culture done.

I’m concerned because this is the second time this year she’s had a UTI that hasn’t responded to antibiotics. The first time she was initially prescribed cephalosporin, but it didn’t respond until she was given augmentin. Unfortunately augmentin is currently unavailable where we are due to shortages.

Is there anything else we can do to help her? Not so much with preventing the UTIs in the first place (she’s had an ultrasound which was clear, so it’s down to her not hydrating adequately, withholding her urine and wiping incorrectly, which we’re working on with an OT and a continence clinic (she’s neurodivergent). But when she does develop the infections, is there anything else we can do to help resolve the symptoms more quickly?

My concern is not about pregnancy as my primary attraction is to women and I can get by without dick. 

My concern is that my periods will come back because they are *nasty*: bleeding for 10 days every 2 weeks, passing clots the size of mandarins, i developed severe anemia and had fainting spells upon standing up from chairs, you get the picture.

I know trileptal nukes the contraceptive benefits of BC, but does it also make your periods come back? I haven't had a single one since Ive been on the shot and before that use the Ring ""continuously"" to skip the
 but switched to the shot due to acne and mood swings. 

The doctor didn't give a clear answer one way or the other about whether or not I'd begin having periods again if I stay on the shot but take the trileptal and I was sort of too much of a mess to remember anyway because I was freaking out about both this and the loss of my anxiety medication.",1,"gas, painful, bleeding, passing clots, severe anemia, fainting spells"

If I take intuniv (guanfacine) which is something that lowers blood pressure, can I still take cannabis, do i need to take only small doses or is it strictly prohibited to take both. I saw that the interaction is ""moderate"" but im not sure what kind of moderate it is 😅

"My son (10M) is diagnosed with ADHD, ODD, DMDD, and ASD level 1. He is 5' tall, 130lbs. He currently takes 1.5mg risperidone and Adderall XR 15mg in the morning, and 1.5mg risperidone and 3mg Intuniv in the evening. He also takes up to 10mg of melatonin at night (doctor advised) - there are no recent changes to his medications. 

He has always had trouble falling asleep, and any time I've raised concerns to his doctor I've been advised to increase melatonin (which I already am not thrilled about him taking so much melatonin so often as I know it can cause issues with the body's natural production, but short of other options we've been following it). 

The last few weeks he has had significantly more issues, often staying up until 3-4am or sometimes even 6am when I get up for work. But he has always gone to sleep at the latest at 7am when I leave for work. Which was concerning enough to me, but now he is not sleeping AT ALL. He has been awake since Monday morning, he did not sleep at all Monday night and stayed up all day yesterday. He did fall asleep around 8pm last night, but wasn't fully asleep as he would talk to me when I'd go in his room to check on him. By 9pm he was wide awake again and has been awake since (now 9am on Wednesday). He says he isn't tired and can't fall asleep. Every time I try to talk to him about the importance of sleep, and try to put him to bed, he gets frustrated because he isn't tired. He doesn't look or act tired, he is otherwise behaving completely normally. He just isn't sleeping. He's also had 2 nosebleeds yesterday, which may be unrelated but is abnormal for him. 

How concerned should I be about this? He sees his doctor every 2-3 months, and I've already contacted them for a sooner appointment as his next check up is in Feb. but they can't get him in until next Wednesday. I'm very worried and unsure what our next steps should be, is this something that can wait until next week for his doctor?

I'm on day 4 or 5 of COVID (mild) and just took my temp with a brand new thermometer both orally and rectally.

My rectal temperature reads 100.5 F which is about what it has read other times when I was sick. From what I can find this is 0.1 degree above ""normal"". I definitely feel like I have a mild fever.

My o*ral* temperature read 96-97 F the first few times I tried it. Just now I tried putting it \*really\* far back under my tongue and got it up to 98.2, but the whole thermometer was practically in my mouth.

Is this a common phenomenon? I mean, when doctors and nurses have taken my temperature they don't put the probe in that far back and they typically get a pretty low reading. My whole school life I had nurses send me back to class because I ""didn't have a fever"" when I was shivering and unable to concentrate. I'm just worried that I might be getting under-diagnosed when I'm sick.",1,

So my youngest brother (16M, about 6ft tall, 300lbs, white, cerebral palsy[legs impaired], ADHD, ADD and OCD, this is what we know he has he probably has more yet to be diagnosed, he takes tezanidine 4mg, baclofen 20mg, intuniv 3mg, and prilosec 20mg?). He was born with some issues because of off base language barriers in Germany leading to several mistakes in his birth as well as numerous ailments. It's been 16 years and he seems to only get more and more violent. Here are a few examples: 
1. my father has a stint in his heart, my little brother knows hitting his chest l, albeit a small chance to do so, can kill him. When he gets violent he hits right where his heart is and scratches bites and punches him. 
2. If he wants something he gets extremely violent and begins to harm everyone no matter who they are or what they've said.
3. He has sent a therapist to the hospital at the age of seven just because he couldn't have his bag of chips before an appointment. He was only 7.

With all the evidence and recorded events with him hospitals won't help us nor will law enforcement. He just attacked my dad again and he's not seriously hurt but my little brother lashed at him out of nowhere. Please if anyone knows anyway to help keep my family safe from him let me know. He eats so much he's almost 300lbs and we can't eat unless he's not thinking of food. I myself am starting to hit a breaking point and just need him away from who he keeps harming. I loved him as the brother he was but he's only brought pain, sadness, and poverty to my family. He's been pampered despite my objections by not only his parents but even MCDONALD'S employees handing him free iced coffee, and my parents can't say no or else it's a public nuclear meltdown.
Anyone who specializes in mental health treatment I need assistance getting him out of the house and hopefully some help with his excessively violent behavior. My dad is fairly old and I don't know what I would do if I find his life was taken just because he couldn't have a chocolate bar. I wish this was some kind of sick joke but he genuinely can't control his anger or his actions nor can we and no one will help. Any means of contact is fine I will try to respond as fast as possible if anyone takes the time to help I'd owe you the world. I don't care who helps as long as I can get my little brother the help he needs and the safety and peace my dad deserves after a hard life. Everyone in my family has been trying out best to find anyone but to no avail. Please change that. I need help.",1,

"[16M, 126 lbs, White, Little over 5ft.]

Duration of complaint: Several Weeks

Location: Ohio

Any existing relevant medical issues: None I know of, Family has history of cardiovascular problems.

Current medications: 

Zoloft (originally) 50mg, reduced to 25mg, then to none

Intuniv 4mg (current), just increased from 3mg after getting off of Zoloft.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had gotten the Pfizer vaccine either prior, or during my dosage of Zoloft. I had noticed my heartrate was higher than usual and assumed it was just the inflammation linked to the COVID shot. Only, it didn't stop long after the COVID vaccine. After a while, I began to notice other side effects that I had not had prior to taking the Zoloft. The next one I noticed was that I was often more tense than I was before taking it, and would feel jittery or tingly. As I spoke with my psychiatrist, I had it lowered, and eventually cut out entirely, but the symptoms persisted, even a few days afterwards. After cutting it out entirely after being lowered off it gradually, I began to notice diarrhea, increased irritability, worse suicidal feelings, and panic attacks; none of which were present, or as severe before taking the Zoloft.
I already did the intuitive thing; speaking to my psychiatrist, but she's booked for at least a month. The best option I have right now is to speak to my doctor, and pray I don't have a f*cking heart attack while I wait. (My family had a history of heart problems.) I've tried everything to calm myself down and lower my heart rate, from taking deep breaths, to listening to music, or watching videos, NOTHING works.
I don't have a segue to end this, other than I'm pretty concerned for my well-being, whether it be inflicted by a medical issue, or myself.",1,"##ttery, ##gly, diarrhea, increased irritability, worse suicidal feelings, panic attacks"
"Male, 17yo, 215lbs, 6”1, USA, taking 200 mg of Zoloft (sertraline) split between morning and night, as well as 200mg minocycline morning and night. I have ASD, ADHD, OCD, and assorted depression and anxiety issues. (Minocycline is for dermatalliomania with acne). My current issues I’m asking about has to do with the fact that I’ve been sleeping 15 hours a day every day for a good while now. I can’t even work through my grogginess, it’s an immediate compulsion to sleep that hasn’t gotten any better since starting Zoloft which has minimized all of my other OCD issues. I am ofc a bit overweight despite eating better and working out 4 times a week. I’ve been to a cardiologist that found nothing with a heart ultrasound after my psychiatrist saw my BP was consistently high around 140-150/90-120. My last blood test found high liver enzymes which the NP sent me to get an abdominal (specifically liver, but they went ahead and did everything) ultrasound which again came up with nothing. This is way beyond depression, as I have had the depression longer than the sleep problems, and I have also problems getting to sleep in the first place, which I account mainly to autism or ADHD, but I’m not sure. As far as I’ve found perusing the internet it seems I fit the description for Sleep Apnea fairly well as far as symptoms, I was just wanting to know how I should proceed, if I should schedule with the PCP, or try and call in to Emory’s sleep clinic about it (I live NE of Atlanta 20 minutes from Emory).

While I’m here I might as well mention that my attention is awful, and treatment resistant as I’ve tried Concerta, Ritalin, Focalin, Vyvanse, Adderal, Wellbutrin, and Intuniv. So I’m not sure what’s left. Think just Catapres and Strattera. My grades are mostly zeros due to not getting work done, and I have symptoms similar to brain fog and just being stuck on cloud 9 all the time. I might ask about memantine as an adjunct to maybe even help with the bit of OCD that has persisted. Idk, I also have a prn of hydroxyzine 25mg, (although I’ve started just taking 50mg as needed) and I’ve tried using it to get to sleep even combined with ZzzQuil but doesn’t seem to help much, maybe a bit but not substantially.

Also, both my cousin and sister have had breathing issues as well, with my sister having bad sports induced asthma, and my cousin having... not sure, her lung collapsed as an infant and she had issues where she had to go to a speech therapist over it, but point being breathing issues aren’t uncommon. No smoking or drinking on my part, my Dad does a bit of both but not much really at all, didn’t ever really smoke around us kids anyways and would usually walk outside at night. My Dad also has bad insomnia and usually compulsively gets up at 3 and doesn’t go back to sleep till 5. We are both night owls so to speak.

Background history of right ear which may cover some important details:

In June 2020, I had my ears irrigated at at a medical office due to earwax buildup. Noticed that while the nurse was squirting water through both ear, my hearing was lesser in my right ear. D.O. looked inside of it once more and she said it ""looks a little dull"", so she put me on Amoxicillin 3x/day for 10 days (30 pills). I went for a follow-up on the day I finished the medication and the PA-C said that my ear was ""as clean as a whistle"", so she let me go. I thought all was well. I kind of had a feeling my right ear still had a little--barely noticeable--partial hearing loss, but I brushed it off as a placebo effect or whatever and I suppose I got used to it. 

They told me to stop using Q-tips to clean my ears, so I haven't used one since.

Come Sep 2, I woke up with a sudden ear pain and partial loss of hearing in my right ear. I went to an urgent care clinic that morning and was diagnosed with Otitis Media. The MD said it is not likely due to ear wax - my ears barely have any; it's likely due to water trapped behind the eardrum. She prescribed me Azithromycin and Flonase and I started taking them that night. At this time, the pain was bearable & barely noticeable as I was continuing with every-day life. It would only hurt if something touched my ear or if I laid my ear on a pillow. I had no trouble sleeping regardless.

Yesterday, Sep 4, as I was lying down, I noticed my ear become *unbearably* painful. I sat up and did some googling for a while to figure out what was going on (I suppose fluids moving around), and noticed my pain gradually became lesser as I was not lying down. I laid down again just to make sure I wasn't crazy and alas, I indeed felt the unbearable pain again over some time. I called my insurance to see if they would cover a trip to the ER over this and while they said yes, they said I should call the urgent care doctor again to see if there's anything they could do. I did just that and was prescribed prednisone 20mg (""take 3 tablets by mouth daily with food"") by the urgent care doctor. I took it that night at 7pm and felt better a few hours later - was able to sleep with minimal pain. They told me to walk in for a follow up in 7 days.

Today, Sep 5, since 1:45pm I felt the unbearable pain come on to my ear again. I was sure it was going to gradually get worse as it did last night, so I called the urgent care center once more and ask if I should take my prednisone early or if I should wait until 7pm or if they should prescribe me a higher dose or if I should head to the ER. I called them at 2pm, they called me back at 3:30pm and told me to take it early and make sure I take it in the morning in the future because it could affect my sleep. I just took it at about 3:45 pm.

I fear that it's not going to be enough--if I take it in the morning, I fear it will stop working in the middle of the night and it's just going to become increasingly worse.

What should I do? Should I head to the ER? Should I insist my urgent care provider gives me a higher dose? What if I wake up in the middle of the night with that horrible pain? I don't want to take the prednisone too early--should I take it?",1,"ear, loss, ear pain, partial loss of hearing, unbeara"
"Hi,
I’m 39, cis male, of Mediterranean origin,  don’t drink  more than once or twice a month and even then it’d like a half pint of cider , I smoke socially but also rarely and do not have a history of addiction though I have used CBD products. I have post-concussion syndrome, joint pain and chronic fatigue. I’m also very sensitive to repetitive sound & touch as well as artificial fragrance  and I just was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea most likely due to an overbite.  I recently started taking 40mg of Vyvanse and after trying 20 and 30 this seems to help with a lot of my symptoms. My TBI rehab raised questions about autism as well. I recently started psychotherapy and after 16 weeks, my therapist supports the theory of neurodivergence and believes I have PTSD stemming from childhood trauma. 

I’m at a point in my life where I don’t know how to advance with the tools I have been using until now and where I struggle with investing myself in new things and I find translating my brain for others exhausting. I’m recently also dealing with ataxia following a severe migraine that required hospitalisation and the reduced mobility is an additional stressor. 

The only real problem with the Vyvanse is that even after the main stimulant effect wears off, I can stay wired all night. Especially if there is something to focus on like a game or social media. I have been supersensitive to caffeine for years now so this isn’t a surprise. Even oversteepeed green tea can cause a meltdown (overstimulated to the point of wanting to throw a tantrum.

I have seen a psychiatrist twice now and I am seeing them again on Thursday.  They suggested modafinil or Lyrica might be the next medication to add to the mix to help with sleep and anxiety. Personally, I’ve been looking at Nuedexta or Strattera or Intuniv and thought I might ask if you had any advice about how to discuss these with my doctor or if I should just go with their suggestions? 

The main reason I’m looking at those is because I recall that one time I tried it a small amount of ketamine was something that made a huge difference in terms of my anxiety especially around being social and expressing my thoughts. Since I have had adverse reactions to Paxil (made me very ill), Celexa (kept me up all night) and Wellbutrin (suicidal ideation) but ketamine therapy isn’t available to me here in Canada (esketamine was fast tracked but flagged as difficult to control and distribute and a final ruling is still pending), I thought other NMDARs might help.

Whew didn’t realise there was so much to say... thanks for reading and thanks in advance for your help/advice!

* As Needed Meds: Ativan (0.5 mg) for acute anxiety and sleep induction

I've been on Vyvanse and Intuniv for about a year, for ADHD-PI (diagnosed by a PhD psychologist during a full psych eval in 2013), plus the hydrochlorothiazide for high blood pressure (was running about 160/90 before medication.

During that same 2013 psych eval, I was also diagnosed with an Anxiety Disorder (Not Otherwise Specified). While taking my girlfriend to the doctor, I struck up a conversation with a very friendly and knowledgable nurse practitioner I know. I live in a medically underserved area, so NP's, PA's and General Practitioners pick up about all the mental health cases as well, meds-wise.

She mentioned that she'd seen a ton of people who were treated for ADHD but not for their anxiety, and that only treating one seemed to make the other worse. This struck a chord with me as it is the exact thing that I have been experiencing during my treatment for ADHD with these stimulants and the alpha-2a agonist, guanfacine, which I was hoping would alleviate the anxiety this go around, but has not quite done the trick.

Meeting with my doctor last Thursday, I asked her if it might be advantageous for us to treat my anxiety as well, as the nurse practitioner had told me that treating both had really turned some of her patients lives around drastically. I told her that Lexapro had been the only antidepressant that had really helped my dad, as he had tried most all of them. She put me on 10 mg of escitalopram daily, and 0.5 mg of lorazepam, both to be taken at night.

When I got home and looked up the drugs on drugs.com to read more about them, I was frightened to read the following:

> MAJOR DRUG INTERACTION!
> Talk to your doctor before using escitalopram together with lisdexamfetamine. Escitalopram may increase the effects of lisdexamfetamine, and side effects such as jitteriness, nervousness, anxiety, restlessness, and racing thoughts have been reported. Combining these medications can also increase the risk of a rare but serious condition called the serotonin syndrome, which may include symptoms such as confusion, hallucination, seizure, extreme changes in blood pressure, increased heart rate, fever, excessive sweating, shivering or shaking, blurred vision, muscle spasm or stiffness, tremor, incoordination, stomach cramp, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Severe cases may result in coma and even death. You should contact your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms while taking the medications. It is important to tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop using any medications without first talking to your doctor.

I called my doc to make sure I wouldn't fall over dead at any moment, and she assured me that such a warning will always pop up when taking Vyvanse and Lexapro together as a risk for seratonin syndrome, but to continue taking both as directed.

I figured both her and the pharmacist (I trust them both) wouldn't try to kill me, but I can usually find some research that puts me at ease. My first five days on the Lexapro have been miserable. I feel cloudy, like the Vyvanse isn't working anymore for concentration, ill at ease, had symptoms of diarreah (could just be stomach bug, it's that time of year, but it is listed as a symptom of SS), dilated pupils (bigger than normal), lethargy (I've slept most all weekend, but last night was in and out for most of the evening), and general stomach upset.

Friends have told me that their first couple weeks on antidepressants saw similar symptoms, but around a week and a half, it started to change their lives for the better. I had a similar experience on Zoloft when I tried it in late 2012, but as I was prescribed it during finals week, I really couldn't handle the cloudiness and headaches, and never refilled my script. This time, I really want to give the antidepressant an honest 8-week shot.

I'm still holding out hope for both, as just treating the ADHD alone has led me to concentrate well on things, but I'm still not able to let them go because of my anxiety – I just overdo them.

My questions are:

1. Do these Lexapro initial side-effects usually go away after a while?

2. Why is my doc not concerned about me developing serotonin symptom, when drugs.com scares the bejesus out of me for taking these two drugs together? Is it common to take these together? Is serotonin symptom exceedingly rare? (a.k.a. – is this the anxiety of a hypochondriac typing this?)

"Hi,

My son is 16.  He is 5'8"", around 140 lbs.  White, in the U.S. (Ohio).  He has been on 50 mg of Vyvanse for years for ADHD, and 4 mg of Intuniv.  He also has spastic diplegic cerebral palsy.  Often, over the course of his life, he is prescribed a new medication that, when we research them, indicates a possibility of a serotonin syndrome reaction with the Vyvanse.  For example, cyclobenzaprine for muscle spasms.  Most recently, because of substantial chronic knee pain, he has been prescribed Cymbalta 30 mg.  He occasionally experiences symptoms consistent with mild serotonin syndrome:  headache, rapid heartbeat, raised temperature, nausea, agitation, confusion.  With the CP, he obviously experiences tight muscles and tremors continuously.        These symptoms are troubling for him, and on days when they are worse, we worry that it may be serotonin syndrome.  This is a pretty disheartening worry, but every time we bring it up with his prescribers, they hand wave, saying that serotonin syndrome is ""rare"", so we have nothing to worry about.  It seems to me that sure, it's nothing to worry about until you are one of the 200,000 annual people in the US that are diagnosed with and have to suffer through it.  To say nothing of those who have it but are not diagnosed.  

So my question is two-fold:  is there some kind of a gold standard group of symptoms that raise the flag for serotonin syndrome, above the level of just normal occasional side effects or personal daily idiosyncrasy?  I don't want to worry when I don't need to, and I don't want to take him off medications that he needs because of irrational fear.  At the same time, I don't want to ignore a serious trend of symptoms and have an emergency admission because everybody poo-poos the symptoms just because the syndrome is ""rare"".  I want to make sure I don't mistake the zebra for a horse.  And I don't want to spend anymore sleepless nights wondering if he will start exhibiting the more serious symptoms, like seizures and unconsciousness, during the night when there is nobody around to notice, and we find him dead in the morning.  There is very little info online about the progression of the syndrome, so this may sound hysterical, but this is what goes through my mind when I can't get practitioners to discuss the situation with me.

&#x200B;

Second, why is it so hard for our physicians to address the risks in a scientific, information-giving way?  Why am I treated like an over-wrought worrywort for raising issues that every responsible institutional website indicates is a consideration?  I am picturing a responsible medical response as, ""this is a concern with these classes of medication, but here is why I believe the dosages and situation make this ok for your son.  (Evidence based information follows).  If you think you are seeing these specific symptoms, it indicates there really is something to worry about, and you should (call our office, go to urgent care, go to emergency).""  I don't think the responsible answer to someone simply asking about serotonin syndrome is just a flat, ""Oh, that's really rare,""  or ""well, it's a risk acceptable to treat the pain"".  It does not provide me the information I need as a health care consumer to understand my son's symptoms and treatments.  And it makes me feel that the background thinking of the caregiver is ""This person is a hysterical Dr. Google who will grab anything I say acknowledging the syndrome is an issue and run with it, without capacity to listen to the nuances of the medical situation.  The less I acknowledge the better.""  Patients should not be treated like nervous nellies just because they ask reasonable questions.  I realize this second part is not a real question, but more of a rant.  I would, however, appreciate any thoughtful responses, because this is a frustrating issue that spans more than just serotonin syndrome, but other nuances of my experience with medical providers, and I would like some honest perspective from practitioners.",1,"se, headache, rapid heartbeat, raised temperature, nausea, agitation, confusion, tight muscles, tremors, seizure"

Summary: ADHD-PI (clinically diagnosed), multiple food sensitivities (gluten, dairy, random things like bananas and asparagus), sensitivity to meds (e.g. tried blood pressure meds to help with stimulant anxiety but feel super groggy) and methylated vitamins (low dose methylfolate makes me anxious as hell, active B6 makes me super drowsy), MTHFR (homozygous MTHFR A1298C, MTR A2756G, and BHMT-02), IBS until I stopped gluten and dairy (mainly very gassy), still rears its ugly head now and then. Long-acting ADHD meds make me feel super jittery / wired, short-acting are tolerable but I still don't feel great. Labs (e.g. TSH, CBC Diff, Metabolic panel) come back more or less normal, vitamin levels (e.g. Magnesium, B vitamins) were low until I started supplementing despite eating very healthy. 

Details: 
* Clinical diagnosis of ADHD-PI: Was always the spacey kid in class who daydreamed all day, ever since gradeschool. Tested bright but not meeting potential. Intermittent bouts of hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Started taking prescribed stimulants in college, helped with concentration but had a lot of side effects (primarily anxiety), even on low doses. Tried all different kinds but not much difference. Long-acting were a LOT stronger than short-acting, I would feel strung out all day on long acting but could manage on short-acting. Thought maybe it was a stomach issue but Vyvanse isn't supposed to be impacted by stomach acid and it wired me up more than Adderall XR. Still not sure why this happens, seems pretty atypical? 

* Social anxiety suddenly hit around 5th grade..remember suddenly feeling anxious and wondering why I was self-conscious around other people. Seemed to come out of the blue and never really went away. Not sure if this points to a biological change? 

* IBS (frequent gassiness) started in high school and continues to this day. Diet changes have helped some (mainly no gluten and dairy) but it still comes and goes. It's a lot better now but it was to the point in college where I had to leave multiple times during a 1 hour lecture to fart and considered quitting school. 

* Sensitive to meds: Typical things that you can take to help reduce stimulant side-effects (e.g. Intuniv, blood pressure meds) nearly put me to sleep. Tried 1/2mg Intuniv for a few weeks and get super drowsy, blurred vision, and can barely function. Tried Clonodine and Propranolol and am so drowsy I almost fall asleep, still feel some residual effects the next day. Taking a claritin 10 mg helps when food allergies flare up, but I'm borderline non-functional for a day since I'm so drowsy and out-of-it. 

* homozygous MTHFR A1298C, MTR A2756G, and BHMT-02: I know, this is probably junk science, but I was eager for an answer  so I took the 23andme test...tried taking low dosage of methylfolate (400 mcg), felt wired and anxious within 30 minutes. Regular folic acid makes me wired and apathetic. Tried taking low dose of active B6 (20 mg), after a few days I feel super drowsy and can barely function. On the flip side, regular B6 (~10 mg) makes me feel super wired and anxious. 

* Gluten and dairy sensitive - stopped both a few years ago and felt significantly better within a few days (greatly reduced jitteriness / impulsivity / muscle pain / anxiety / moodiness / and improved digestive symptoms). I never had any of the classic food intolerance issues e.g. hives, the shits, would mainly have gas, anxiety, increased impulsivity, moodiness, sensitive to hot and cold, and fatigue. When I was taking ADHD meds (Adderall) and SSRIs during this time I felt borderline manic at times, like my neurotransmitters were going into overdrive. Read through MACS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome) symptoms and they fit pretty well when I was still eating gluten. 

* Suspected bipolar because of the difficulty with mood and impulsivity and feeling borderline manic at times before I quit gluten when I was taking ADHD meds and SSRIs, tried nearly all of the mood stabilizers (e.g. Lithium, Lamictal) but nothing helped much

* Got blood and stool testing after feeling better from stopping gluten/dairy and had some strange food allergies e.g. onions, garlic, mushrooms. Stool showed candida overgrowth, SIBO, and low amounts of good stomach bacteria (not sure how relevant this is since it was from a naturopath). Treated with antifungals / high dose probiotics, may have helped a little bit but nothing significant. 

* Also tested positive for Giardia, treated with antibiotics. Digestion didn't improve after treatment.

* Got on SSRIs due to anxiety and to help with stimulant side-effects...calmed me down in some aspects but made me more anxious and pleasure-seeking in others. Tried other SSRIs and some SNRIs but nothing seemed to ""fit"" or feel right, always felt too anxious or apathetic or both. Finally got off them after ~8 years since I didn't like the way I felt or how they interfered with my concentration, have been off them for nearly a year. Anxiety and depression have come back but they're mostly situational (i.e. due to me dealing with health issues and not knowing what the root cause is) and manageable for now. 

* Stopped drinking 1 month ago (was having some whiskey on weekends, no beer/wine/cocktails), no improvements.

I've seen multiple ADHD specialists, GPs, and a couple of specialists (e.g. autoimmune) but my labs come back normal. I have no idea what's going on and could really use some advice since I'm starting to feel like there's no way out and I'll never get a handle on this. I'm starting to think maybe this is something like Mast Cell Activation Syndrome because nothing else fits and my doctor's agree that based on my symptoms and lack of reaction to treatment whatever I have seems pretty rare. Any advice would be much appreciated. ",1,"gassin, super drowsy, blurred vision, gas, increased, candida overgrowth, sibo, stomach, mast cell activation syndrome"
"So to preface, probably a medication issue...  
Here are my medications:  
Adderall- 30mg / day (20mg xr morning 10mg ir afternoon) 
Seroquel- 50mg/bed time  
Lamictal- 100mg/day  
  Recently started: intuniv (one week ago, 2mg) 
the last two days I started feeling super spacey and just out of it about 8 hours after intuniv dose each time. It then durates for another 6 or so and seems to be gone for the most part by the time I wake up. I just feel confused and disoriented, almost surreal. Like I'm hearing things but not hearing them, every moment feels a bit weird... also kind of a weird sensation in the front of my head, kinda brain foggish. 
  
Any ideas? Maybe this will dissipate soon? My blood pressure hasn't dropped since starting intuniv.

"I used to be extremely hyper-active, until about age 6-7, when I took Methylphenidate/ritalin? I don't even know, I was young, and my parents told me it was medicine that would make be ""better"". I am now 16 years old. I went from very hyper-active, to completely disconnected from the world. I can't talk to people, I suck at socializing/communicating, etc... People say I'm smart (good grades and shit) but I feel like an idiot most of the time. There are a lot of simple and easy things I should know how to do, but don't. I think it may be a result of Methylphenidate. 


Something I found after a couple of Google searches: Given that Ritalin diminishes a person's ability to make neurons, or subsequent pathways for those neurons to travel, children may not be able to progress, physically or even emotionally. Current research suggests that Ritalin may also prevent a child's brain from developing on course.


This is what I think I think has happened, I don't know, maybe I'm just like this. But I suspect my personality? is a result of the Methylphenidate. Let me know what you think.",1,

"Mainly speaking to redditors who have diagnosed ADD or ADHD here. I've been diagnosed with ADD and have taken aderall for school which I've noticed has made me feel like the guy from limitless at times. I have recently switched over to methynol and it has the same effects on me. I have a first date(not my first date, but a first date) coming up and was wondering if it would be a good idea to take one of my pills before hand to help out. Has anyone else ever tried this?

"Hey all, going to try to keep this as concise as possible, but including all the relevant information is still likely to make it a moderately long post. I really appreciate anybody who takes the time to read this.

**Relevant background/history:**

\- Mid 20s, diagnosed ADHD at 10, wasn't prescribed anything due to also having tics

\- Lots of drug abuse between 15-19. 100-500mg MDMA 1-2x/wk, mixing with psychs, etc. 18-19 cocaine a few times a week while drinking. Stopped all non-psychedelics after that.

\- Since 18ish have been tired all the time, 1-2L coffee per day, occasional month long periods of abstinence to see if coffee was the problem, always ended up back in same place

\- Depression and anxiety around 22, also late autism spectrum diagnosis. Doctor suggested that ADHD meds might also deal with the depression and anxiety. They did, and I also became way more capable of basic life tasks -- cleaning, groceries, paying bills on time, socializing, working, etc.

\- No ADHD medication worked for more than 3-6 months at a time. Since then I've tried Dexedrine, Vyvanse, Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin SR, Foquest, Biphentin, Strattera, about 5 SSRIs, 2 SNRIs, Wellbutrin, Modafinil, as well as a bunch of nootropics(racetams, choline, alcar, lions mane, uridine, etc). I've tried all dosage ranges for the ADHD medications, typically have settled at the top for both methylphenidate products and amphetamines, although I suspect with amphetamines I should have been placed closer to the middle or low end. Antidepressants all made things worse, amphetamines worked amazingly for a while and then started to induce paranoia/dysphoria/agitation/obsessiveness, methylphenidate products all worked great, although with a very short duration -- 2.5-3h effectiveness(e.g. SR would be 2.5-3h useful, 2 hours dip, repeat). Despite the duration issues, it's drastically helped everything from depression to anxiety to ADHD. Modafinil was great, but that was a different doctor and only for a month.

\- In the last year or so, I'll use methylphenidate as prescribed for a while, then eventually have 1-5 days of binging. It's not to chase euphoria as there really is never euphoria anymore, it's just to...actually be able to function for the majority of the day. I've never experienced negative side effects due to this(e.g. nothing like amphetamines, HR barely rises, no agitation or anxiety, can still sleep at the end of the day, etc.) with the exception of terrible comedowns and having less medication to actually use properly. People close to me don't notice that I've been taking more during the binges, they just notice that I'm more depressed and less productive on all the other days. Coffee is objectively more stimulating(alertness, anxiety, talkativeness, etc) than methylphenidate for me, even compared to the binges. But the doses scare me. The worst has been a few 24-36 hour binges of 600-900mg in 40-100mg increments. Lately it's more like 200-300mg/day for 4-7 days. It doesn't feel recreational, it's always functional despite being clear abuse. There are certain areas of my life that I struggle immensely to get in order with regular doses, and the binges seem to give me the clarity to actually figure out how to deal with them and take the needed actions.

\- I'm scared of talking to my doctor about this because it is the primary thing that has helped get the majority of my life in order, and at this point the only problem are the binges. I don't want to lose access to a medication that I'd be near non-functional without. I'd switch to Modafinil, but my doctor isn't comfortable prescribing it off-label, and generics from India don't have the same benefits for me, nor does Adrafinil.

\- I'm not sure what to do to stop this pattern. I already do all of the basic health stuff -- exercise, healthy eating, o3/b complex/vit D/magnesium/zinc, melatonin on days where I binge, etc.

\-One option I've thought of is keeping medication in safety deposit box and just walking half an hour to the bank every morning. Alternatively, I'm guessing taking NAC in the morning might help, possibly along with a week off. I dislike taking time off because after a few days of being useless my depression tends to get significantly worse -- it's by staying productive that I feel good about myself and avoid ruminating. One main issue is that invariably after a binge the regular doses do absolutely nothing, so I end up tapering down(e.g. 160, 140, 120, 100, 80) and then run out. So I'm thinking the most actionable time for intervention is when starting a script -- maybe I should start lower than my prescribed dose and try to get my body used to that? Or have careful behavioral interventions set into place(e.g. safety deposit box?)

**My questions:**

1. Given the history of going through all of this(22+) with the same doctor, are my worries about having the prescription taken away unfounded?
2. Even if having the prescription taken away is a legitimate risk, should I still talk to my doctor?
3. Assuming I don't talk to my doctor, any advice on what I can do to get this under control? Whether it be behavioral interventions or adjustments to my medications/supplements.
4. How likely is it that I've done long-term/permanent damage through this? The majority of the research I've read seems to point to methylphenidate not being neurotoxic or particularly dangerous as long as the abuse isn't IV/insufflation, but I'm still concerned about this. Even after taking 1-3 month breaks the medication seems significantly less effective.
5. If there's a non-negligible chance I've done long-term damage, what can I do to attempt to recover to baseline?
6. Any other thoughts or advice is much appreciated.",1,"paranoia, ##ysphoria, adhd"
"I have been taking sertraline for several years as my depression had gotten unbearable. Last year I bumped my dose to 100mg and everything has been great.

A month ago I was diagnosed with ADHD and started on 10mg methylphenidate. 

The past three weeks I have felt phsyically and mentally terrible, resulting in a blow up fight with my partner, missing work, not being able to eat, etc. Which all culminated last night in me having the worst breakdown ive ever had, and making a plan to kill myself. 

Hours of research later, and I havent seen another post even close to describing what ive experienced.

Maybe ive just discovered im one of the unlucky ones where ritalin exacerbates depression symptoms and suicidal thoughts.

"Hey, rn for real,

F (22), don’t want to make it too long so I’ll go right in, this pas year i’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, while trying to get treated for anxiety. Ritalin works wonders, however I asked my psychiatrist for some meds specifically for anxiety, since I’m a student right now and can’t afford therapy. 

Tried escitalopram- went completely zombie 

Tried sertraline- had two tachycardia episodes where I thought I was dying (also turned totally apathetic, couldn’t cry, everything was boiling up but didn’t get released)- called the paramedics, everything was fine on the ECG. The first time I really thought I was going to have a heart attack, it was the scariest, most intense episode of my entire life. 
Of course at first, I thought it was the methylphenidate (stimulant), considering I’m at a pretty high dose right now (20mg 2-3 times a day). 
My psychiatrist then recommended for me to up the sertraline dose (and take pregabalin to alleviate the symptoms of increasing the dose). I did. It was awful. I went completely paranoid, had tachycardia all night long, didn’t sleep at all- I quit cold turkey. 

I know, not too smart for someone in the medical field, but I honestly couldn’t handle it and was totally prepared, after doing research, for the side effects (which actually weren’t too bad, I had brain zaps for the first week but it’s gotten a lot better).

Since the two heart incidents, I my somatic symptoms have gotten a lot worse. Every single palpitation (which I already sporadically had before my adhd diagnosis, in periods of intense stress, like right now), makes me even more anxious where I go into a loop of constant focusing on my heartbeat. 
I try to tell myself “you’re healthy, you’re fine” (also doing a Holter soon, cuz my blood tests came back really great, just to make sure, because I lost a lot of weight by being on sertraline- I was constantly stressed out), but every single thing makes me lose my crap. By focusing on it, I make the symptoms worse, for example I feel a stinging pain in my breast, which I know is not a cardiac symptom, it is more psychosomatic, but it makes me even more anxious and the cycle repeats itself.

Now, I know the best option would be therapy, which I will attend as soon as I get the means to do it. I quit all the meds besides Ritalin which really improves my quality of life.

My question is: Do you have any tips/tricks to trick my mind to relax ? I tried guided meditation, listening to sounds, Jacobson’s relaxation technique, but have a really hard time focusing. 
Do you have something specific that works for you? anything really. It’s so hard to study while being constantly terrified of dying. 

I’ll take anything, or try anything (reasonable) that you recommend. I’m so tired of this. I can’t study, my life revolves around being constantly anxious. I feel so defeated because I couldn’t handle the meds, but still can’t get it under control on my own.

"I have been on this medication for ADHD for probably 5 years total. I’m just wondering why sometimes it seems perfect and then sometimes it makes a person feel like garbage (tired and depressed)? And I don’t mean later at the “comedown”, I mean shortly after taking the medication.

Background: I have tried methylphenidate —- I was on the short release form for probably 2-3 years, and it seemed to kind of work at the beginning and then for moving forward for some time.. at least, what I mean is, it worked for providing some focus to me for a couple hours in the day.(The long-acting forms, i.e. Concerta and biphentin did not work for me for some reason!). But, then I realized I needed something longer-acting for my lifestyle.. (but it also started making me lethargic somehow, or doing the opposite that it was supposed to!)…

I had also tried Adderall XR —— I think I was on it for roughly a year or a little less (many years ago), but it actually did absolutely nothing good for me at all, and then my P-doc at the time did not let me change back to something else! I had since moved on to a new p-doc, and that’s when I got put on the methylphenidate, and now I’m back on Vyvanse (since methylphenidate seemed to stop working, and I needed something longer-acting anyway!).

I just want the treatment to work for moving forward, consistently, just for once…? :(",1,lethargic
" This is my first post and it's terrifying to post it. I'm sorry it's so long.

Um I really don’t know how to organize this, it probably won’t be that coherent but I’m just really desperate at this point and would like to know if anyone might have any ideas what exactly could be the issue. So all in all, thankyou for your time if you read this. I’m already panicking at the thought of anyone reading this for many reasons, I’d like to ask anyone reading this to try and separate me myself from certain actions I’ll be mentioning.

Alright so, I’m certain that when it comes to mental health, all details of significance are worth mentioning so here’s a brief background on my short life. I’m 16, female, an only child, I’ve never felt ANY romantic or sexual feelings towards anything or anyone which is frustrating in its own right, however this is potentially a result of my medication. I’m prescribed Daytrana which is a brand of Methylphenidate. I’ve been on this for my ADHD since I was diagnosed when I was extremely young. It comes in the form of a patch that is placed on the hip every morning and taken off every night, done everyday just with alternate sides each time. Sorry if you already knew this but from my experiences not many people know of Daytrana so I felt like explaining. I’m diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder, Bipolar type 2, PTSD, Depression(though this seems to be intertwined with the other disorders), and ADHD as previously stated. Multiple professionals I’ve talked to brought up the possibility of me having OCD due to constant counting, checking and needing to redo things a certain number of times(mainly 5 and other multiples of it) such as sentences, closing doors, flipping switches, eating and drinking, and so on and so forth. I dislike self-diagnosing so I’m just considering it a possibility and either way it’s not anywhere near my main concern. 

Okay. A big thing I’ve been needing to bring up is information about my father, but I just couldn’t think of a smooth way to do so, so I’ll just spring into it this way. My father killed himself, he shot himself on March 5th, 2017 while drunk. There is SO much that goes into this so I apologize if it’s painfully dry to read. This was his 6th **known** attempt. He had tried when I was an infant, many, MANY times before and after I was born and his mental health deteriorated the older he got. He wasn’t even very old, he was 30 years older than I am, and was 42 when he passed. I blame myself and can’t stop doing so due to me being the last person he spoke to. I was a bratty 13 year old and I didn’t treat him very well considering he didn’t do so towards me. He suffered from depression, anxiety, ADHD, and Bipolar Type 1. He was definitely a narcissist. When I was young(around 10 and younger) I went through a phase of running away from my house(s) due to not being able to handle the fighting anymore. I wasn’t allowed to leave my bedroom and had to go straight to it whenever I got home. My father didn’t want to deal with me and my mother wanted to make sure I was out of my dad’s range so I ended up being neglected. He’d tell me things like I was “asking to be raped” because I had worn a skirt at age 11, and whenever I ran away he’d say things like “let the bitch go”. There is so much more but frankly I’m tired of writing it and you’re probably tired of reading it. More details about his death though. He was going through his second Cancer. His first was Salivary Gland Cancer which took 2 years for chemo. His second was Colon, which is strange considering how young he was. He shot himself the day before his 7th(final) round of chemotherapy for it, which would’ve been the more painful according to his experiences with the treatment priorly. I know his illness is probably a large contributor to why he decided to do it, however the fact that my final words to him were something along the lines of “I don’t feel like talking to a fucking drunkard, so bye.” and then hanging up. This was at the point where Leafy was still an active YouTuber and saying “kill yourself” or “kys” were common, I’d sprinkled one of those in there somewhere too I know. I regret these words but cannot take them back, and that sums up all details of significance from my past, ugh it sounds so over the top when I say it that way. Moving on.

Here’s where the serious issues come into play. This is going to be a mess to write so I apologize in advance. Also I’d like to preface this by saying that almost all of this information comes from my mother and other “witnesses”. Ahhhh Oh god this is so difficult to write I’m so frustrated by all of this. Anyways whatever I’ll just get to it in rambling fashion so there will most likely be grammatical errors ahead. It has always been incredibly difficult to wake me up and I’m so grateful to have such a wonderful, patient, caring, supportive, and loving mother like I do, otherwise I’d be utterly screwed. She spends a little under 1 hour every single day just trying to wake me up. Until eventually I just get up normally. My mothers single and works very high up for the largest power company in our area so she’s a very busy lady and doesn’t have the time to spend more than what she does trying to get me awake. Due to this I have missed ALOT of school, not to mention how difficult going to school was already due to my anxiety disorder. In my freshman year I went 3 days in September, once in October, and then went to a “special” school from April twentieth-something onwards, still missing a large amount of days. It’s a miracle I passed to be honest. But the thing that bothers me most. Is the fact that when trying to wake me up, I’m active. I will 1) Respond the conversations, 2) Get up and walk around, 3) Become violent. Very violent. The scariest part is that I am not conscious for ANY of it. I’m thankful my mother doesn’t blame me for it when she has the full right to. When asleep I am incredibly abusive and remember none of it. I’ll spew every offensive word I know at whoever else is physically there. My mother’s white, yet I’ve allegedly called her racial slurs of more than one culture. My mother is a heterosexual female, yet I’ve called her slurs for homosexual males. But I’d call her every derogatory word in existence a million times over if it meant I’d stop unknowingly giving her giant(larger than a baseball) black and blue marks. I’ve almost given her a concussion twice. There are also a lot of bite marks. I want to stop doing this, I know surprising right, so back in October an appointment was scheduled with a neurologist. That appointment came up a few weeks ago. It went terribly. I had been terrified for it for months, I was scared to know if there was something wrong. But I was even more scared that it would come up that there wasn’t. The doctor I met with didn’t take the meeting seriously. He specialized in the “physical” neurological issues and didn’t exactly believe in mental illness. Once he was told I have ADHD, he spent the rest of the appointment forcing his beliefs onto me about how ADHD isn’t real and that I wasn’t exhibiting any signs of it. You know, perhaps I wasn’t displaying symptoms because the medication I was currently wearing was working?? Big frickin’ shocker there huh. He also examined my whole body and when he got to my arm he brought up my scars (there very deep and not very uniform considering I use scissors) and held up my arm, he looked and smiled at me, and started teasing me about them while chuckling. Saying things along the lines of “ohhhh did the cat do these?” “yeahhhh the cat did these haha”. At this point I broke and began bawling my eyes out. I felt gross, my face was covered in sweat, tears, and snot. I started to panic and didn’t want to scream in a place like this so I bit my wrist and other parts of my hand, along with my knee. I drew blood this time and my wrist has felt odd ever since, as if all the stuff inside it got tangled up around the protruding bone and my veins feel weak. He then started to mock me for crying and continued telling me ADHD wasn’t real. The appointment ended in him saying I was “perfectly normal” and I should stop drinking iced tea. I don’t drink iced tea. He gave me homework, “Research Twenty Benefits of Laughing and Smiling”. I felt extremely hopeless. I’m going to have tests done in November. I don’t remember the name of the process but it involves scans and being hooked up to it for like 48 hours or something. I just really want to know if anyone has any idea what my behaviors while being “asleep” might be. Oh yeah I forgot to mention that on multiple occasions, friends I was with reported that I sorta “snapped” and ran the hell away screaming and crying to myself wide-eyed about something following me and watching me. A few years back at an event with my 4 friends it happened. It was at the SteelStacks venue thing which is basically an old steel factory with a lot of bridge walkway things and stairs to view it well. According to two of my friends, I was with them walking around on the bridge looking at the place before I just randomly darted away from them running and screaming. I apparently didn’t recognize them and avoided them due to terror. I ran all the way to a casino parking lot, tried to climb the fence and ended up cutting myself on it, curling up into a ball on the dirt under two pine trees in the fetal position crying about how “he can’t find me” or “I’m okay they aren’t here” and trying to stay quiet so they wouldn’t find me. One of the two ran after me, the other ran back to the other 2 to tell them what happened. They contacted my mom and told her to come get me which she did and I had retaliated in a parking lot before she dragged me into the car. My eyes were wide and bloodshot, my eyebrows were furrowed, my face was constantly twitching and I was whispering things to myself. I remained this way the entire drive home. At this point I remember vague bits of the event through my own eyes. I remember how dark everything was, how distorted everything especially other people looked, and how no matter where I ran I saw a black figure in the distance facing towards me. I remember going batshit and screaming my head off whenever my eyes fell upon it. I hung out with the two who I had run away from a few weeks ago and when reminiscing on it one of them had asked what exactly happened, and when trying to explain that I wasn’t conscious during the entirety of it, she just kept insisting “but you were”. I gave up and the conversation ended. The final thing I’ll mention is how often I feel dormant within my body. Everything around me feels “loud” and like its all pounding into my being. I find myself naked often and when seeing myself in the mirror during these episodes my face constantly twitches. Like my eyes rapid blink but not always both simultaneously, my nose wrinkles up again and again, my mouth twitches up on both sides(I hope you know what I mean by this), my eyebrows refuse to stay unfurrowed, my entire body trembles freakishly, I continually scratch my head and my hair becomes very ratty, I tend to curl my arms up frequently in odd thrashing motions, whenever walking anywhere my eyes dart all around me  again and again as if I’m expecting something to be around watching me, lastly I end up becoming infatuated with staring at my reflection and digesting it. Feelings of shock come out as I feel like I look like some disturbed monster rather than myself. I hear whispers in the back of my head of conversations I can’t make out, I hear thuds and doors/windows opening and closing, along with the sound of someone urinating into a toilet(like a stream of water hitting a pool of water and echoing, like the sound of urination from how I hear it). These episodes bother me at first and I check around my entire house for where they’re coming from which always end up being a futile effort considering they aren’t really coming from anywhere specifically. Another strange thing I’d like to add relating to this is this one type of episode I have. Things similar to this have occurred a few times but I’ll mention the most alarming and prominent one. Last November, I was in my bathroom and began cleaning out the drain of my sink with Q-Tips. This was done in silence which is strange since I’m always listening to music or on the phone with my best friend. The cleaning itself is somewhat bizarre but that’s not the part that scares me about it. I was like this for 11 hours straight. I was naked the entire time. I was also on my period. When I came to, I was covered in urine and blood from it and my legs were stained red. I remembered none of the cleaning besides what I could put together with the information I had. I feel this isn’t normal behavior of a person. Maybe I’m conceited in thinking that but I really just want to know what the hell is wrong. The doctor I met with had no interest in actually helping me and intimidated me to much for me to share all the details properly. So I decided to do so here. Sorry that some parts of this were as gross as they were, I felt they were necessary though. So all in all, please, please, **please**, if anyone might know what the hell is going on with my brain please let me know. I’m desperate. Sorry this was so terribly long, thankyou to anyone who read it all, I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. I’m incredibly scared about posting this but I suppose I’ll just do it. Thankyou for your time.",1,ad
"Hi everyone, hope you're well.
So I was diagnosed bipolar II with schizoaffective disorder..ok well, I know I had my highs and downs today I manage it far better, Ive learned about myself.

2 years ago I decided to stop all medications, but still not the benzos.. another story.
I was really fine, regaining my life in a way, in an environment that's not the best...I was going better and better.

Until I went better but really better, too much.
I knew it, this elation, increased energy and focus, the need of really less sleep if at all during days.
I remember telling myself ""fck it has come back! I have to enjoy now that I feel that great, I don't know how the counter part will be ..""I'm in the counter part.
I thought I would manage the down until I'm fine again, but it wasn't that easy I can tell you, I didn't remember I could go that down so fast.

Depressed.
Low energy, more anxious, oversleeping..

I had to cut the edge of my high, so I asked from myself (the doctor had proposed antipsychotics, but respected my wish not to take those shit meds that turned me to zombie and sometimes made me even more mad), but this time I knew I was going too high, and Olanzapine, which I later will know to be a nasty antipsychotic, did the job really fast.

From the first day I could feel it erase my high mood.
Was on 15 mg for about 5-5 months.. can't tell for sure, just to say how time is also a concept that does match with Olanzapine.
But I started to feel imbalance, memory impairment, confusion..lowered the dosage, I try to quit it now, I go slow because I feel really weird if I quit cold turkey.


This med also caused me visual hallucinations (I never had what I experienced while taking 15 mg, some days 20, and it stopped while down to 5 mg now so Highly suspect Olanzapine to be responsible).

Sorry, that's for the background so you know bit more about me.

Now I feel like ""in between"", my depression is going better I think, still not joyful... you know.
And I try many ways to 'induce' my hypomania state, because I'm just feeling great and actually I do something..
While down I do absolutely, almost absolutely nothing.
I sleep so long and can't wake up and do what I've to do, to the point that my coffee -cigarette morning is now coffee -cigarette-methylphenidate just to get out of bed.


It's a nasty game, when I'm feeling better I will end at a position where I will need to cut it off because I know the troubles I can get in with that over-confidence, delusions and all.
But while down, I try my best after a certain point, to flip again into the better state.

Are other people in the same situation?
Trying to trigger the ""high,"" while down, but then needing to ""put yourself down"", it's almost that, then seeking the good state again because the depression is just awful and the meds don't help?

For myself yes antipsychotics cut the high but no one, or any SSRI, and related helped.
Ho yes also I take Bupropion form days to days (150mg XR).


Thanks much'

"so - yesterday I smoked some weed as usual (definitely laced, but fairly clean compared to the stuff I’ve used to smoke) and I’ve never felt this way while smoking - after some time I’ve started feeling (I think) catatonic, some of my moves were VERY slow and despite being completely aware of the situation I couldn’t help it, some times I couldn’t even move too. I’ve also noticed patterns and things moving around on tapestry and generally in my room, heard and smellt things that weren’t there and I’ve had this weird feeling of derealization, from the perspective of time the whole trip definitely felt like a dream and I was out of it mentally more than I anticipated during the trip

my flatmates said they were fine and didn’t experience ANY of the stuff above, which concerned me even more

I should also mention I’ve started taking Sertraline 100mg again 2 weeks ago after a 1,5 month break + Methylphenidate 20mg 2 days ago after a 3 week break, so I’m even more confused if the psychotic-like symptoms were actually THC-induced, Sertraline/MPH-induced or both",1,"catatonic, psychotic - like symptoms"
"I live in Germany, am male, 21 years old, am autistic and suffer, and I mean suffer, from adhd. Specifically I struggle extremely with executive function disorder and will often feel tromendous amounts of pain when trying to do the simplest, most benign things. Even if I usually enjoy the activity, it will be tromendously difficult to start, and even if I force myself to start regardless, the task is usually ludicrously exhausting and unenjoyable. This issue has become worse over the years and is still rapidly worsening, so treatment is needed urgently. This also applies to sleep, so I will often stay up way too late because lying awake feeling like that can get very unbearable very fast. I also suffer from panic attacks, but that issue was significantly improved through online self help and for now is no longer a priority. 

Last summer I stayed at a German psychiatric hospital. During the 6 weeks I stayed there, I kept waiting for treatment to start until the very last week, in which I lost all hope of treatment starting. Sure there was a weekly hourly meeting with a psychologist, but since he barely knew me or my conditions, he didn't have many new or worthwhile things to say and would often just give vague self care advice not specific to my condition you can find in any online self help group. Sure there was group therapy, but it was often quite rushed, many pages of the power points were skipped completely and time was over minutes after the topic was fully introduced. Sure there were station staff, but they mostly told me to be patient and take care of things during a later that never truly came.

When I was done with my stay, they told me to find a place where people with my specific condition live together and can train with the help of staff to manage the struggles of every day life. After one year of searching not only myself, but with a lot of help from family and social services, such a place does not seem to exist within my state, maybe not even within the rest of the world .

I've been to a Psychiatrist for about 2 years now. Medication does not help against my symptoms. He has a tendency to give me meds against symptoms different than the ones I describe in hopes that they will indirectly lessen my other symptoms. Tiredness meds won't help me against my horrible pain, ease of mind meds won't, and neither will focus meds. I took them anyways, but they really don't work. He wasn't completely useless, as he had something pretty decent against panic attacks until I found something more effective, but he's running out of ideas and it is starting to show that he isn't up to date on adhd and what it does to a person. His next approach is a nutritional one. I see it mostly as a time waster during urgent times. 

I used to go to several psychologists and therapists, but the focus was more on the panic attacks back then, and thinking back on it, it was absolutely pathetic. Sometimes they wouldn't even be able to tell a panic attack apart from a tantrum, and no panic attack ever stopped from telling the patient to stop screaming and crying or you'll no longer talk to them. I tried to find a new psychologist in my area for 2 years, but the capacities are completely overwhelmed and no one will be able to take new patients within the foreseeable future. I now booked online therapy. I only had a single introduction session and again received some self care advice which hasn't really been possible for me to follow. I still have to see how this will go, but I don't have the highest hopes. After a session I missed due to being bad at simple arithmetic and getting the time wrong, my therapist went on vacation and won't be back til next week. Since this issue also has a very significant physical side as well, I am unsure how far conversation therapy will get me. 

Since this issue mostly manifests in the form of pain and exhaustion, I also consulted my physician, who said that since the pain is psychosomatic, there was nothing he could do for me and referred me back to my psychiatrist. 

Aside from the likely useless nutritional approach of my psychiatrist and the online therapy that I feel might not be enough on its own, what else can I do to get my rapidly declining mental health under control?",1,

(I'm 19 yo guy in university atm.)

 If anyone can help me clear this up for me or give advise it would be helpful. My father has ADD and I’m thinking I have it too. I went to the doctor and talked about my symptoms. The doctor told me my feelings are normal and do not get along with the symptoms he saw on his screen. I’ve felt different my whole life because of my increased stress, anxiety and overthinking as the people around me my age weren’t having the same. I’ve always been ‘slow’ in getting my tasks done and getting motivation to do big and small things. I don’t think I have straight depression, but I feel like my mind is getting distracted from happiness a lot of times because of stressful or anxiety thoughts it binds with the things I hear or see around me.

After the doctor saying I didn’t have anything. I decided to take one of my dads methylphenidate aka ‘ritalin’ pills to see how it would make me feel.  
For the first time in my life(it felt like at the time), I felt like I could actually enjoy stuff around me more. Like I was sitting on my sofa with shorts on and I really enjoyed the way it felt on my legs. I was more engaged in talking with people around me and I felt like I could really focus on the conversation and what I was talking about more.

I don’t know if these symptoms are normal for someone that doesn’t have ADD. But to be honest I’m thinking and looking for ways quite a lot recently to get to this level of peace(in my mind) and happiness without taking any medication and I sadly have to say that I wouldn’t write this right now if I found these ways.

I feel like I want some clarity and advise while also being scared that I don’t actually need anything and that everyone else has this too and that I just have to man up like everyone else.

I was already scared to go to the doctor of fear that I’m normal and everyone has this. Wich came true and is exactly what happened. I feel like I want to talk to a psychiatrist, but then again being scared of exactly what happened at the doctor and getting the same results.

In summary, I can feel happiness, I have friends that I talk too and I enjoy stuff as long as I focus deeply on it. But I’m having a hard time controlling my emotions, because of this lack of motivation and increased stress and anxiety.

A solution like planning would be a good way for me to take more control of in life, but my problem lies more on my ‘negative’ emotions taking control of my good emotions and so also my life.

I don't directly want to feel more special or outstanding than a person with normal mental health, but if there is something special I have, then there must also be more 'special' ways then normal solutions to treat it.",1,"stress, anxiety"
"I take 54mg of Methylphenidate for ADHD and I am on 25mg of Lamotrigine, working up to 200mg. I just started  Wellbutrin 150mg a week ago too.

I took my ADHD medication and the Wellbutrin at around 9am this morning and I'll take my Lamotrigine at night. 

It's my friend's 21st birthday tonight so I planned on celebrating. But I haven't drank on Wellbutrin yet so I'm not sure about the effects... I've heard about lower alcohol tolerance and also lower seizure threshold. Some people say it doesn't affect them at all though?

"Im 22 and have been suffering from severe depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old. I tried 2 depth psychological therapies, one behavioral one and over 13 different meds (SSRI, SNRI, atypical, tetracyclic, moclobemide, neuroleptics) without any success. Nothing helped.

The social anxiety is one of the biggest sources of my depression and personal main issues. SAD causes me to not go out, not experience anything or new things, not meet people, not socialize, not getting real friends or romantic relationships. By that it kills my self esteem, future perspectives and mood/will to live longer. These were just some examples but all the restrictions you can think of caused by SAD are big contributors to my depression & self esteem. 

Im on Mirtazapine now and while its the only one that had a tiny bit effect at least (better sleep, better appetite) I still suffer a lot of daily pain from the moment I open my eyes in the morning to the moment when I close my eyes and lay in be to sleep. I got on Mirtazapine after long break of ADs as my doc told me its very low-risk and she was right, at least regarding side effects (Idk about possible withdrawal) which I dont have any, except for sleepiness after I take it and increased appetite, but I welcome that as I had bad insomnia and sleep issues and Im very skinny.

So I was wondering if I just give a new med I never tried before a try or try the Mirtazapine + another med as a combo. Im really desperate and just started a new job I really like and dont want to lose, but in my condition right now I cant keep it up any longer if I dont improve mentally. I also registred for the gym and changed my diet, but Im still depressed and anxious af. Also my cognition is very bad, almost dumb, many people ask me if I have ADHD because of my bad focus and memory. 

Side info: I always wanted to test for ADHD as Methylphenidate (tried of a friend) improved my symptoms significantly but my previous docs didn‘t want to test me for ADHD (in my case rather ADD) 1. before my depression/anxiety isn‘t treated as these two can be the cause of ADHD symptoms and 2. because one needs to be diagnosed for AD(H)D in his childhood for treatment. So I just thought I‘d never be able to get test or treatment for ADD (which I really fell like having in addition to the depression and social anxiety).

Is there any antidepressant that has low risks for side effects and withdrawal that you could recommend me? Im adding the list of my tried antidepressants below so you have an overview. 

Meds to try next I was Thinking about:
Nefazodone
Clomipramine
Vortioxetine
Tranylcypromine (Parnate)
Selegiline 
Prozac (Fluoxetine - Idk surely as no serotonergic worked so far)
Lamotrigine (or any other antipsychotics, because maybe I‘m wrongly diagnosed as all these 13 meds of antidepressants I tried didn‘t work)
Wellbutrin (tried once but gave up after 1 week as I was having bad anxiety, so quit but maybe I just need more time?)


Meds I already tried:
* Cipralex (Escitalopram) + Promethazine
* Venlafaxine (Effexor) + Quetiapine (Seroquel)
* Sertraline (Zoloft)
* Opipramol
* Paroxetine (Paxil)
* Duloxetine (Cymbalta)
* Moclobemide (Aurorix)
* Amitriptyline
* Gabapentin
* Mirtazapine
* Diazepam (Valium)

took Celexa (citalopram) for 4 years against depression. don't know if it helped with depression but it did with my Premature Ejaculation!
Weened off Celexa because it ""didn't feel"" right and because I read that SSRIs might interfere with ADHD?

I really really want to get rid of my PE because it cause a LOT of anxiety and depression.

help?

I have suffered from premature ejaculation (sometimes less than a minute of penetration) my entire sexlife, which hasn't been not very existent for long periods, since I have very low self-esteem due to my PE.

I have also suffered from depression my entire life to the point where I have been suicidal for about 90% of 2019.

I have now at age 26 finally been diagnosed with ADHD.

I have tried Celexa (citalopram) for 4 years but ulitmately weened it off in 2019 and flew solo, since I somehow had the gutt-feeling, hat Celexa is not the right thing for me. and now I also read that SSRIs, such as Celexa might potentially increase ADHD symptoms. I only had sex while on Celexa for a few times but I believe it helped a LOT with my PE!

currently I am trying a low dose of Methylphenidate (5mg retarted + 5mg unretarted), which seems to help me immensely both with my ADHD and anxiety! yay!

but I am yearning so badly for a somewhat normal sexlife (I am single at the moment and my last girlfriend of 2 year didn't want to have sex due to religious reasons, which is another complicated story.)

now here's the thing:

I want to be healthy. I want to be happy. I want sex.

has anybody has similar issues? I am happy with my methylphenidate for my ADHD now but I really want to get rid of the premature ejaculation somehow! but I am afraid that taking Celexa again might increase ADHD symptoms.",1,hd
"Warning: My writing style uses a lot of confrontational rhetoric.


Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is a mild stimulant whose effectiveness for treatment-resistant depression is very well established. Depressed patients treated with Ritalin show no tendency toward dependence or abuse. Except perhaps for me.

My dose is 40mg every 4 hours, which is sufficient for me to be able to work. But when I run out of medication, I can no longer work at all, not even a little bit. My productivity is zero. I must wait and do nothing, and waste an indeterminate period of my life, ranging from one week to six months, depending on when I can next acquire my doctor's prescription, and when I can next afford to fill it. Since Ritalin is a controlled substance, I am responsible for paying the full price.

I started using Ritalin in graduate school, and because of it I was able to carry on in my program for several years after my mental illness had already reached such a severity that, after a hospitalization, it become necessary to take a daily regimen of sedating anti-psychotic medication. For about 5 years now, my dosing schedule of Ritalin has never needed to be changed, but my energy and passion for my work has faded. When the university stopped supporting me as a graduate student, I become officially disabled. And if I am no longer as active in mathematical research as I used to be, that is because it is harder. But I am still working on my doctoral research, which I believe to be my best work, and I intend to finish it in my lifetime.

For the last year or so I have frequently felt the cruelty of poverty in the absence of the medication that I need to remain productive. The standard of treatment for a disabled mentally ill person who claims to have the powers of a mathematician, is denial of drug-treatment and suspicion of drug abuse. My case of treatment-resistant depression is very similar to that of Paul Erdös, who first acquired a prescription for Ritalin and/or Benzedrine in his late 50's when he was diagnosed with depression. Erdös is believed to have used those medications continuously for the rest of his life, except for one month during which he was compelled to demonstrate that he was not addicted to them. In my case, the milder stimulant Ritalin is still sufficient, and although it is quite possible that a stronger stimulant such as Amphetamine would be a superior treatment, I may never have the opportunity to do that experiment. But the fact that patients are not allowed to do their own medical research, is hardly a tragedy. The only problem with my current situation is that I am going without any treatment at all more than half of the time, and treating myself would legally void my right to be treated in the future.

Methylphenidate cures my depression, and that is not an opinion. If you want proof, I can give it to you, but if you expect me to try to convince people that I have ADHD, which is the only psychiatric condition for which stimulants are an approved, patented, and trademarked treatment in this country, then you should be aware that nothing is more offensive to a teacher of mathematics, than to participate in the same kind of 'hand-waving' that teachers, attorneys, and politicians abuse so liberally for the sake of lessons, prosecutions, and elections.

It is widely reported on public internet forums, that if somebody is lucky enough to get their hands on some Ritalin or Adderall, they should definitely crush it and snort it, and maybe try taking it with alcohol too, because it is believed that pills thus administered can cause a certain euphoric experience comparable to cocaine. I have researched the medical literature about long-term use and abuse of Ritalin, and although it was once popular among hard-core needle users, in the 1970s it was discovered that a certain ingredient in the injected pills causes a permanent and debilitating heart defect known as talcosis. My advice to people who use drugs for pleasure, is to consider that there may be no act so profoundly selfish and tragically immoral, as encouraging others to do the same.

Adderall, on the other hand, is habitually stolen or bought by recreational drug-users from children whose ADHD is so severe or debilitating, that a stronger stimulant is required. It is also highly desired by many people who intend to use it responsibly, if not medically, and has various euphemisms such as ""cognitive enhancer"" and ""smart-drug"" and ""study-aid"". It can also be used to drastically reduce one's need for sleep. And despite the disturbing pictures we have all seen of meth-addicts, who don't sleep at all for months or years, or until their supply runs out or they become too disorganized or delirious to continue the administration of injections, that is obviously not the 'responsible use' that I am interested in talking about. The truth is, I have often taken Ritalin continuously for as much as three days, sleeping less than an hour each night, because I find the symptoms of sleep deprivation to be actually quite benign. That it continues to be drastically over-emphasized is probably a consequence of the unfortunate legal affiliation of all stimulants with methamphetamine, which may well be the most powerful psychotropic substance ever discovered by man. I have also not experienced any withdrawal symptoms from stopping after such 'binges'. And since the purpose of sleep is not well established or understood, one could argue that there are no known serious consequences of sleeping very little for one's entire life, that could possibly compare to the sacrifice of spending a full one-third of it unconscious.

Meanwhile the distinguished professor of medical ethics John Harris publishes articles regularly with titles such as ""Chemical Cognitive Enhancement: Is it unfair, unjust, discriminatory, or cheating for healthy adults to use smart drugs?"", as if it is not laughable to think that philosophers and biochemists and neuroscientists could be so obsessed or delusional, to think that modern drugs can improve upon the intellectual powers of the human brain. And I have also read enough of the bible to know better than to be grateful or thankful, when in the words of the Lord himself, people with too much intelligence should not be trusted, and will probably go to Hell.

I am not the only person who needs Ritalin to be able work, so perhaps you can understand why I choose to speak openly and publicly in defense of the basic right and freedom to have more important things to do than get high on meth or cocaine, when mental illness, mathematics, and Minecraft are not only three of my favorite things to teach, but also things that nobody else really cares to fight for. But if you seriously disagree with depression, or if you really don't believe in stimulation, then I would certainly hope that I am not the only friend you will never have. And I hear that Freud practically invented ""research chemicals"" (also called ""designer drugs""), which are quite popular these days among the wealthy and well-endowed. Sadly, a lot of people still believe that crazies like me just hate ourselves or love ourselves, and that smaller egos need bigger egos. And of course, there is the cigar-thing. Freud taught us that sucking on a cigar is actually a symptom of homosexual perversion.

My recommendation is to always carry a cigar on your person, so that if you ever meet somebody whose ego is much bigger than yours, you can take out your cigar, light it up, suck on it a bit, and blow it in his face. The fact that anybody who has the moral authority to tell people to burn in Hell, would allege such behavior to be savage, merciless, spiteful, antisocial, vindictive, even criminal, would be an important point that I would be honored to have the privilege of mentioning in your biography. After all, if you have the sophistication to use a cigar as a weapon, and the will to fight back against a bully, then breaking a man's ego is hardly a tragedy, when prisons and asylums and Hell are obviously complicit in the business of breaking a man's soul. And perhaps your enemy could even benefit from a modern anti-depressant like Effexor (which is not known to cause shrinkage), especially if the day will ever come when he gets the joke. I really think it would be a remarkable thing, if in your hands, a cigar is much more than just a cigar.

Although I didn't realize it at the time, my first psychiatrist asked me questions that were rhetorically designed to put me in a position of being unable to defend my comprehension of emotions such as love and friendship. But like a Vulcan, although I have the capacity to experience all normal human emotions, I also have the power to reject or suppress them. And that is something I am proud of, so if my doctor tells me that I need to take anti-depressant drugs to compensate for my lack of girlfriends, what can I say to that? After all, the first axiom of psychosis is cogito ergo sum, which is Latin for ""cogitation sums to orgasm"". When I was eventually compelled to stand up and walk out of that psychiatrist's office in frustration, I don't think he even looked me in the eyes.

My next psychiatrist was much better, and she was quite confident that my primary diagnosis was actually OCD. I had shown her the records of my productivity, which I had been monitoring daily for several years, along with all the different anti-depressants that I had tried. Some of them had made me feel a little better at times, but all had failed quite demonstrably to help with the decline of my life's work, the only thing that I really loved passionately. She commented that my chart was 'the best she'd ever seen', and I was flattered when she asked to make a photocopy. But I never understood why somebody who is experiencing the symptoms of a devastating and undiagnosed mental illness, would not become obsessed, if there is some possibility of preventing or treating the degeneration into infirmity or dementia.

And so it was not until I asked my psychiatrist to prescribe an anti-psychotic for my depression, that I discovered the cure for my headaches, and it was not until I asked my neurologist to prescribe a stimulant for my headaches, that I discovered the cure for my depression.

""hic tamen vivit..."" - Cicero",1,tal
"I just posted this in the psychiatry forum, but I realize now that this subreddit is probably a better fit. Sincere apologies if it's a little bit unclear or hard to follow:

I'm not sure if I'm in the right forum, but I'm searching for information about psychiatric drugs which cause the patient to talk to themself. Specifically Adderal, Modafinil, Methylphenidate and similar medications, which somehow disconnect speech centers from voluntary control. And I apologize if my question is unclear. It seems to me that if the speech centers alone are targeted or stimulated, that these sorts of stimulants lead to genuine madness, owing to the patient actually listening to their voices rather than controlling their speech. In other words, if some sort of reflex triggers uncontrollable muttering independent of conscious control, the patient's train of thought can become directed by these spasms or impulses. It's terrifying to think that a drug could deliberately target these areas of the brain with an extreme overload of energy, or some sort of hyper-caffeinated stimulation, while at the same time having little or no effect on any other area of the brain. This has happened to me personally with both Adderall and Modafinil, and it's a side-effect I haven't found mentioned in any of the studies I've been able to find through PubMed. I'm extremely curious whether any psychiatrists have heard of this happening. Can a drug stimulate only speech areas of the brain while doing precisely nothing to any other area of the brain? It's a terrifying experience, and I'm wondering whether this specific psychosis even has a name. I want to underline that I'm not seeking any kind of medical advice, but rather I'm wondering whether anyone has ever heard of this before? Thanks


And I'm also wondering if anyone knows how often psychiatrists personally sample the drugs they prescribe? For instance, in my opinion a longterm and open-ended prescription for Adderall *cannot possibly have a happy ending.* Surely psychiatrists must know this? Because the difference between me with a giant prescription bottle of pure amphetamine (aka Adderall) and a methhead talking to himself while sifting through a garbage can isn't necessarily that great. I don't have to mug people or go car-hopping in the middle of the night, so criminality-wise we're quite different, but we both share the experience of being high during our day-to-day lives. And actually, I'm likely taking *way more* than the average meth user. Yet somehow the term ""speed freak"" isn't generally used to describe functional people. Also, at this point, the drug seems to have fried my mind *at least* as much as any psycho roaming the streets, so these distinctions are becoming almost completely meaningless to me.....",1,
"I am taking Methylphenidate 5mg short action every 4 hours 3 times a day.

I was expecting to feel thing switching on. Instead it feels the opposite, like things have been switched off. It said online that you should expect the medication to really kick in around 20-30 minutes in. I'd say it was within 5 minutes and I just felt this feeling of powering down. Everything just seemed less. Is this the medication working as expected. It isn't a complaint. The peace and quiet is certainly helping. It's just the complete opposite to what I was expecting for the medication to be working.",1,
"So was diagnosed about a month and a half ago. I was prescribed 10 mg and it seemed to do something, but not much. This month they titrated me up to 20 mg. I had to wait a week for them to fill my prescription (I guess there's a shortage or something) and in the meantime ran out of my meds. I got the new prescription yesterday and wow!

"Hello everyone, i'm having doubts about medication and i would really like some help. 

I have been diagnosed as an adult with severe ADHD - combined type about 6 months ago. I started on Ritalin IR 10mg in the morning and 10mg after lunch.

Recently i have switched to Medikinet (methylphenidate extended release) 20mg in the morning + Ritalin 10mg after lunch.

&#x200B;

While i can definitely manage my symptoms better now, most days i still struggle a lot; today for example i had a quite productive morning but after lunch i got hit by heavy brain fog and i'm having a really hard time doing anything beside doom scrolling.

This happens at least 2 or 3 times a weak. It's exhausting and it's having repercussions on my mental health.

&#x200B;

I heard a doctor say in an interview that the average dose for methylphenidate is about 1mg / kg of body weight but i did not find anything online about the validity of that statement.

Is 30mg too low for me (M24, 70kg / 155lbs) or do i simply not respond to stimulants?

I'm really worried because I don't want to feel like that again I've come a long way from that and I really don't want to risk loosing where I am. I find myself wanting to engage in old destructive habits to stop the feelings.

Is this just what it's like on adhd meds. Are my choices either productive but miserable or unmedicated and struggling are they the only options I have.

"i dont know if anyone else feels like this for sure.

but I often hear that I'm bad at responding to texts: because I am, granted. if I don't immediately respond as I get the message, it could take hours. even if we're having a ""conversation"" over text i sometimes just stop in the middle and don't reply.

and that also kind of applies to people. I have never in my life really, actually, felt homesick doing anything. when I was 16 I spent a year abroad and I never really ""missed"" or yearned my family's company. we only ever called once a month. 

recently my (long-distance) gf told me that she felt depressed about always being the one to text first and that it felt like I didn't really want her company. my perspective is very different. I put lots of effort into our relationship and I try very hard to balance time spent with her/friends/work/myself and always prioritize her company the highest — if I'm hanging out with friends or alone I drop whatever I'm doing as soon as she texts me.

but she's right. she always is the one who texts first. and I realised that that's how it is with all my friends and even family. if they didn't reach out first I wonder how many people I would just not talk to. but it's not because I don't care at all. it couldn't be further from the truth.

I've now set reminders on my phone to be reminded of her at least three times a day (morning, midday, evening).

we had a conversation about it and I tried my very best to explain to her that me not texting first is not about me not caring at all and that it's just a mixture of complete lack of time perception (now vs not now) and essentially just being distracted all the time. she's not taking it well at all. and I fully understand her and get why she doesn't take it well. it really sounds like I just don't care or that my brain thinks she's unimportant. but it's just so far from true. I don't know what to say to make her understand how that works. I'm scared that it's gonna be detrimental to our relationship and feel like I should almost just have lied, but I simultaneously refuse to build a relationship on that, for her sake and mine and because it would be so f****ing unfair to her. i just don't know what to say to her. I feel hopeless. i really love her but every word I say sounds like I don't. I don't know what to do.

edit: holy crap! reading the amount of support and similar experiences means so much to me. thank you all for your advice and kind words. I'm trying to read all the comments but there's so so many.

edit 2, update: started my first dose of methylphenidate today! at a pretty mild dose of 18 mg I still notice some level of distractibility and my time perception still seems kind of impaired, but oh my god it is also like a different world. after 20 minutes of taking it i went into my room and just.... cleaned it. it was so easy. and then afterwards i immediately went for a run. at no point did i feel overwhelmed with the urge to quit or cut corners. of course, the thoughts were still there, but they were so easily dismissed. i also notice that my fatique issues are almost completely nullified. at least for now. feeling really hopeful about this - let's see if it helps me stay in touch with friends and loved ones. i can already tell i might need a bigger dose because i do still get distracted, but this alone is a fucking incredible experience by comparison.",1,distractibility
"Hi all. I got diagnosed with ADHD about a month ago and finally got my meds for it about a week ago. Since then, I have started writing again - something that I've always loved but always had a hard time focusing on unless I was hyperfixated on it. I've started cleaning. I can pay attention in college and I'm actually doing my assignments (if you know me, you'd know this is *huge*). I can pay attention to people when they speak to me. I can respond back without going all over the place. I can *function*.

I had no idea until now how intrinsically linked my ADHD was with my depression. I mean, I'm *functional* now. And because of that, I feel accomplished, and I'm doing my hobbies, and I'm feeling more confident about myself, and just... I'm smiling again. I'm finally smiling again.

My wife and family have even made remarks that I seem much more alive now. And not in a ""wired"" way. I'm just happier. This medication has done what all the antidepressants in the world couldn't do: it is giving me my life back.

"So my doctors have started me on very low dosage to titrate up to 30mg of Methylphenidate (Ritalin/concerta for our brand name friends) and while I only took a 10mg dose about an hour ago I’m honestly shocked at the effect.

I’ve finished my work tasks for the day, I went outside and I feel like I can see for the first time, if that makes sense, like I look at things and actually process information about it rather than just “see” it and be unable to process it because of everything else my brain was doing, I heard the birds for the first time over the sound of traffic outside my house, never paid attention to that. 

I asked myself “where did I put my Keys?” When leaving the house and… just remembered. 

I know it’s a low dose and definitely hasn’t got me back to 100% concentration but it’s taken the edge off and wow, I wasn’t expecting such a weirdly profound effect. 

Edit: just as I’ve had numerous people starting about the superman effect not lasting, the effects wane over time. I just want to say I know I stated the effect was profound but I don’t have increased focus, functional ability or bundles of energy. I’m feeling the effect because I have returned brain capacity from not over thinking, being anxious or depressed for the first time in 16 years. In fact yesterday all I wanted to do was sleep, I don’t feel like superman, I feel like I have a quiet head, that is all. ",1,

My doctor prescribed me Atomoxetine yesterday, because he linked my worsened anxiety to Methylphenidate and said that we should give it a shot.

I am frightened because I fear that I won't be as focused as I am with Methylphenidate (still with all the difficulties) and I need to focus to properly function at work. I'm scared that my performance will be impaired as it was previously when I didn't take the meds. That might be silly but I am just terrified.

"So I recently got diagnosed with ADHD (combined). For some context- I’m 21, female, and am on sertraline, Wellbutrin, and birth control. My psych prescribed me 10 mg of methylphenidate (generic immediate release) to start. 

I took my first dose today at around 1 pm (will be taking it in the mornings i just got my meds late today) and after about thirty minutes of laying down I felt super tired and immediately fell asleep. The sleep I got was really heavy and I don’t even remember initially falling asleep. It only lasted about 20 minutesWhat does this mean?

When I woke up my brain feels light and airy, but my head feels a little heavy if that makes any sense?

Do I need to up my dosage, and if so can i just take two pills instead of one while I wait to meet with my doctor? Does it have to do with my other medications? Is it maybe because Ritalin just isn’t the right stimulant for me?

"I'm super new to the meds game. I first met with a psychiatrist a couple weeks ago when my therapist recommended I try meds to help with my functional freeze, forgetfulness, & inability to focus on things I don't want to do.   
  
My psych recommended I try Concerta (18mg) first as she described it as more ""gentle"" than amphetamines and less affected by shortages. Although it did its job (I found pivoting to less-fun tasks SO manageable, felt super calm, and I was able to sit and read which I haven't been able to do for years) it also made me feel like I hadn't slept in a week and was running on lots of coffee + zero rest. When I stopped taking it, this no sleep lots of coffee feeling didn't go away for over 48 hours even though I was behaving like myself after 10. I also felt less creative, funny, silly, and MYSELF which won't work for me as I work in a creative field.

When I went back to my psych, she prescribed me Methylphenidate LA (10mg) to try as an alternative, describing it as more ""gentle"" than Concerta but still different even though they're both in the same family. It's also available in lower doses than Concerta. I'm trying to figure out what to expect (I'm quite skeptical after my mixed experience on Concerta) and I can't really find much info online about people's experiences with Methylphenidate LA or it's differences to Concerta.

"Hey all. I've been in this community for a while now and have finally been prescribed medication. I've been prescribed Ritalin when I was a young child, and it made me into a zombie. I've also taken Adderall as a child. Now, having been rediagnosed in my early thirties, the psych center that works with me gave me generic for Concerta 18mg to start out and see how I do. I already took one pill yesterday which gave me an energy boost and the slight increase in socializing. I decided that today, I would take two pills (per her directions if one wasn't enough). Yes, the energy boost is there again, and more desire to socialize. And, I guess me writing this post is also an example of what it's doing to me, as I normally don't have the motivation to create posts. However, I will add that I am feeling a bit \*light-headed\* now...

Is it common for these meds to take time to build up in the body like with antidepressants?

"TLDR: I'm going to run out of my prescription of methylphenidate (extended release) in a couple days and can't get a refill for a few weeks.  How can I minimize the horrible brain fog and lethargy that I experienced last time this happened?

The long-winded version: I was diagnosed with ADHD a couple years ago, and after trying Adderall for a while (unsuccessfully), I didn't try meds again until a month or so ago when I started methylphenidate.  Because we're still trying to figure it out, the doctor has only prescribed 2 weeks worth at a time.  The first 2 weeks was 27mg, and I'm now on 54mg.  Here's the problem.  I only have a couple doses left, and my follow up isn't for another few weeks (scheduling errors on my part).  I ran out of the 27mg before the 54mg was available, and those few days were horrible.  Extreme brain fog and lethargy that made it really hard to function.  I'm about to run out again and I'm worried the symptoms will be worse since I've been on a higher dose.  I requested a refill from the doctor and asked for advice on avoiding those symptoms, but all they said was that I should have taken days off from it (when I asked about this before starting, I was specifically told to not skip days). I've googled it, but everything I've found says either there's no such thing as methylphenidate withdrawal (not true in my experience), or to seek advice from your doctor (which I have to no avail).  I'm going to try and call the doctor's office in the morning to see if I can get some actual answers, but I'm not too hopeful.  Are there any good ways to avoid or at least mitigate the near debilitating withdrawal symptoms I had last time?  I know cutting extended release pills to taper off isn't a good idea.

"My doctor recently diagnosed me with ADHD-PI, as well as with Asperger's Syndrome, and he suggested I should try either Atomoxetin (Strattera) or Guanfacine (Intuniv).

He also said considering autism symptoms, these two medicine would be good to start with.

I am sceptical, since as far as I understood, Atomoxetin is an SNRI medicine, practically an antidepressant. I don't feel comfortable taking antidepressants as I have had a abd experience with them, and I am not currently depressed. 

Is there any benefit to taking Atomoxetin or Guanfacine instead of Methylphenidate, and are the adverse effects of either of them more preferable than Methylphenidate? Can you give any examples from personal experience with eirher of them? Thank you!

"After a 2.5 year journey through the system this morning I finally took my first dose of Methylphenidate.

"Hi so, I've been on 20mg extended release methylphenidate hydrochloride (Inspiral) for a few months now. It was causing me immense anxiety, mood changes, personality changes, irritability, etc. so mu psychiatrist took me off it. We tapered off with 10mg for a week, and now I've completely stopped.

I'm experiencing immense withdrawal symptoms:

• elevated heart rate
• anxiety & depression (these are the worst)
• restlessness
• i felt immensely fatigued the first 3 days after stopping but my energy levels are okay-ish now
• vivid and upsetting dreams (but i wouldn't call them nightmares)
• foggy thinking
• inability to get any work done

My ADHD symptoms this week have been horrible, I can't deal with the executive dysfunction at all. I expected this, but it's really adding to the depression because I have college assignments (which I've already gotten extensions for due to my disability accommodations). I am on a week-long mid semester break right now but I have work to do still. The withdrawal is also hightening my already difficult feelings around a lot of past trauma emotions coming up for me lately, and in general making things so much harder to manage.

I am with my father for break, and it's nice to be away from college and everything, but I miss my friends and partner and feel constant anxiety and depression in my body.

How do I cope with this? I know that after today (day 4) it should begin to calm down a bit, and I have a meeting setup with my disability inclusion counselor tomorrow. I just find this all so excurciating and I need some advice with how to cope, especially since I can't afford not to work for much longer (I haven't done anything for days and I feel so stupid and useless).",1,"mood changes, personality changes, irritability, elevated heart rate, anxiety, restless, highten"
"I have started Methylphenidate 3x5mg per day. I am currently on day 4. I feel really strange today. I first of all felt nauseas this morning with a headache prior to taking the medication. Then since I've taken it I've felt a bit out of it. It feels like it is slowing me down. Slowing my thinking. I got confused earlier when I looked at the date and it said 04/10. I thought it was the wrong way round (I live in the UK). I've never got confused by a date like that before. I've never used drugs before, but if I was to describe how I feel I'd say stoned. Every day I hate taken the medication has given me a different experience so far, some good some bad. In general I feel a lot calmer, but almost too calm today. I actually feel less motivation than normal but for different reasons. A bit numb and disinterested. Is it normal to go through moments like this while getting used to the medication?",1,nauseas
"So i normally take 54 mg of methylphenidate(concertra, xaggitin, delmosart) however due to the recent supply issue in the uk ive been on the modified release capsules, 10mg and 40mg MR. Now since taking them i dont know why but i feel like i can focus as much as i did on the 54mg tabs. like i cant focus and its affecting me. Should i ask to be on 60mg caps or just hold it out until the tabs come back in stock? And why do i feel like this",1,
"Hi! 

I always had issues to fall asleep. Like, I can be tired, lay down in bed, in the dark, no screen, no noise... And still remain perfectly awake until 2 am, when I'm exhausted and finally fall asleep. I attribute that to racing thoughts of ADHD. 

So I take 10mg of Mianserin, an antidepressant that has a sleepiness side effect. And it works, and has for a few years now. 


I had to change my psychiatrist last year. 
But my previous one suggested that a small dose of mph (Ritalin) could quiet my brain and thus, let me sleep. 

I never had the chance to try though, since I was still titrating when I changed, and only had Extended Release caps. 

My new psychiatrist doesn't agree with this idea. He thinks that mph, even at a small dose, will just boost my brain and prevent sleepiness. 

Still titrating, I recently started to test Immediate Release Ritalin (I was on Extended Release so far). So I have 10mg Ritalin tabs, which can be split in half easily. 

So I'm kinda tempted to try taking 5mg before bed. 

Has anyone any experience using mph to sooth them before bedtime?

I have a printed proof of prescription from my pharmacist, the original bottle and label and a printed medical report/psychiatric evaluation from my nurse practitioner. Is there any paperwork I might be missing? Trying not to get thrown into a foreign prison lol

"I was diagnosed with ADHD in April of this year and started taking methylphenidate. The dose has been gradually increasing and I'm currently on 15mg twice a day.

It definitely benefits me, I don't feel so fatigued all the time and my head is so much clearer than it usually would be, but I swear it makes me feel dissociated. I've tried looking for all the different side effects of methylphenidate but I'm not finding anything related to dissociation.

Does anyone else experience this?",1,"adhd, dissociated, dissociation"
"I recently got diagnosed with inattentive ADHD. I have for a while been taking 10mg and later 20mg of Ritalin daily, except on weekends (unless I have something important to do). I have a lot of anxiety and this type of medication freaks me out a little. Ritalin was weird for me. It worked fine some days but most of the time with unpleasant side effects. Here’s some of the things I experienced:
- It helped me to control my anxious thoughts better, but, if I already was anxious it got much worse than usual, often leading to panic attacks 
- Usually a pretty tense feeling overall, tension headaches, tension in jaw.
- Sometimes I experienced some sort of lightheaded feeling. I sometimes felt sort of light in my body (in an unpleasant way)
- I would often feel pretty stressed after it had stopped working, and often I would breakdown emotionally at night. (Crying a lot for seemingly no reason)
- It happened that I could feel sort of manic. But that would usually be if I hadn’t taken it for a while or when I got a higher dose
- Often very fidgety 

But it did help me think clearer. It got more quiet in my head and I was able to choose what to think about. If I was actively thinking about something but had to do something else I could sort of just stop the thought. Which is like impossible usually. 

A friend of mine recommended Vyvanse. I talked to my therapist and that’s what I’m going to start taking in a week or so. But now I’ve seen a lot about it being stronger than methylphenidate, or that methylphenidate is a “nicer version” and it scares me because the side effects of Ritalin made me think that it must be stronger than Vyvanse. I basically just need some sort of reassurance, and I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience with methylphenidate?",1,"tension headaches, tension in jaw, lightheaded"
I received diagnosis for ADHD yesterday (with bipolar differential) and was prescribed methylphenidate 10mg. Today I used it for the first time and I feel more stimulated and focussed than I have ever felt in my life.

Hi ! I’m diagnosed adhd and anxiety and have been prescribed both medications for each individual issue. Today I made a big mistake. I was studying for an exam and took my regular dose of methylphenidate (10mg) this morning but this afternoon in my flustered state of last minute studying I accidentally took another 10mg from my pill box instead of my vitamin I didn’t take this morning. It’s now late in the evening and i’m struggling to settle and feeling overall a bit like i’m tweaking. My exam is at 10am tomorrow and I would really love to get some sleep before then. I googled if I could take diazepam after taking methylphenidate and no red flags showed up but I just wanted to ask my fellow adhd people if they have experienced this before or taken this combo before? this is hell!,1,

It could probably also be the opposite, that is, the current tension caused me anxiety and therefore nausea.)

However, to my surprise, it made no difference! I stopped because I'm saur thirsty and cold.

"Hey guys, just a question about ritalin/methylphenidate. 

I was on it in college, never took it everyday, just when I needed it because I hated how it made me feel. 

I was just put back on it after fighting with my psychiatrist for it and it doesn't feel the same. I'm ""on the same dose"" my current script is 0.5/1 pill twice a day. Got 30 pills so I only take one a day because half a pill does absolutely nothing. But it seems 1 pill does very little as well. I'm still struggling on keeping on task, paying attention to what I'm reading and getting words from my head to paper when writing papers (I started an online masters program earlier this year). And I still cannot get stuff on time for the life of me.

"Today I tried my first 20mg dose of methylphenidate and while I expected it to have the same stimulant effects as coffee, it barely did anything.

To cut a long story short I am in the process of being tested for ADHD and it is unclear whether or not I have ADHD. I definitely have at least some of the traits of ADHD as my attention and motivation is very poor.

I also have depression and anxiety and if I drink coffee when I don't have a tolerance to it the coffee is the most powerful anti-depressant, anti-anxiety and anti-ADHD drug I have ever came across. However I can't drink coffee all of the time as I develop a tolerance to it.

I am also on duloxetine (cymbalta) and aripiprazole (abilify). I have heard that abilify can blunt the effects of methylphenidate although I am unsure how true this is.

I have also heard people say that the fact that it doesn't give me a euphoric 'up' means that I do infact have ADHD.

What do you think about all of this? How does methylphenidate (ritalin) feel when you do it? Does this mean I am more likely to actually have ADHD?",1,

"Hi I’m looking for advice on medication, I have a lot of the inattentive subtype adhd symptoms, so my doc put me on concerta 18mg (I had tried modafinil and HATED IT because it worsened my anxiety.) I was so worried to try concerta after my experience with modafinil because they’re both stimulants, but their outcome was different. I got along with concerta much better - the downsides were the crash I felt after ~10 hours of taking it and it still kinda felt like my anxiety was off the charts, EVEN THOUGH it makes me more confident while doing things (sounds paradoxical but I manage to do things even though I’m still too anxious / afraid so I do them but feel unwell inside due to these emotions) and even though I’m on 10mg diazepam at night. I feel like I NEED something to taper off/ control my anxiety during the day because it’s all over the place I am usually a super anxious person and while concerta helps with some of my adhd symptoms it does almost NOTHING to my anxiety and sometimes it may even make it WORSE. How can i get the best of both worlds? Should I pair concerta with an anxyolitic (buspirone)? Or should I up-titrate my concerta to 27mg? - would that lessen my anxiety or make it even worse?? Or should I just change to a non-stimulant like atomoxetine (strattera)? Any recommendation / personal advice or anecdotal references are completely welcome!!

I started taking Concerta about a month ago and I've noticed that I really don't like to socialize when I'm on the medication. I'm feeling a bit suspicious because all I've read is how Concerta makes them ""more sociable"" and ""more confident"" while I am having the opposite effect. Generally, converseting becomes more enjoyable with friends and it's easier to concentrate and actually listen to what the other person is saying, but when it comes to meeting new people or having an interaction with a stranger I get more social anxiety then I do when I'm not on the medication. That's not to say that that is the reason why I feel like what the title states. I just feel very calm and enjoy the way I can just do whatever I want to do by myself.

"Hi everyone,

I've been taking Concerta (methylphenidate) for a while now, and although it helps me function, it does come with some side effects like physical fatigue and going into ""zombie mode"" when the meds start wearing off. I really want to keep up with regular exercise because it makes a huge difference for me, both physically and mentally. I’m especially into boxing, but the issue is that my training sessions are only in the evenings after work.

I often find myself having to make a choice: either I take my meds, which helps me get through the day, or I skip them so that my body isn’t too strained before training. Unfortunately, when I don’t take the meds, I struggle with staying effective at work and often end up missing deadlines or messing things up, which is really frustrating.

I’m a bit concerned about whether it’s safe to work out, especially doing something as intense as boxing, while on Concerta. I’m not sure how my body will handle the physical exertion, and I’m worried about feeling unwell during the session. I don’t want to find out the hard way during a workout.

"Hey, I'm a 35M, recently diagnosed with ADD, and I've been taking Medikinet (methylphenidate) for about a month now, currently at a dose of 10 mg (5 mg twice a day). And i'm getting really exhausted by it -

Right after taking the meds, things are generally okay—I get a bit more energy and can focus a little better on tasks that usually bore me (like going from a 1/10 to a 5/10). But sometimes (recently almost every time) , a few hours after taking a dose (around 3-4 hours later), I experience some really bad crashes. Sometimes it’s fine, but like today and yesterday, it was pretty awful—intense anxiety, a feeling of my heart racing, couldn’t focus on anything, just overall something I can't afford to deal with, especially at work.

My hands have been unbearably cold same with my feet even typing this now it’s like I came back from winter weather outside.

When I do anything i always zone out for a long time till I snap out of it and it’s out of my control whether it’s reading or typing something. 

And I thought the medicine was supposed to like help me stop shaking my leg to keep me focused it had done nothing but made it way worst i will do it without noticing for 30+ minutes while i’m at my computer and i don’t notice.

"I've heard many people say Methylphenidate (e.g. Ritalin, Concerta) doesn't ""work"" for them, and I've heard many people say Ritalin makes them feel ""numb."" It's starting to seem like anything other than the kids-sized dose (18mg) of Concerta for me makes me feel all the ways people who hated ADHD meds feel. It feels like the world is just happening without me being a part of it, like an observer, but with a racing heart. This is not at all like I feel with adderall. Nothing I can find explains why they feel so different if they supposedly both act on norephinephrine  and dopamine.

I was wanting to get past the up and down effects of adderall instant release, and taking adderall every day makes my shoulders hurt. I also found it difficult to time out my day with the instant release and remember when to take the second dose, so I had been super excited about Concerta. The 18mg sort of seemed to help a little bit but not enough but the next higher dose (27mg) is completely unsustainable for me. Yeah, sure, if the problem was me being fidgety in class this medicine would stop that but it also makes me not want to do anything cognitively difficult, which defeats the purpose for an advanced professional in a specialty field. Yet with the controlled substance requirements, I don't think I can get another dose for an entire month?

Congratulations to anyone who has gone through the process of adjusting meds. I am really struggling to get it right and would appreciate tips, research, or encouragement.

I hope folks here can understand that trying to search for this information here feels especially overwhelming, and can either share their experiences are link me to other good posts about this.

"A few years ago I got prescribed methylphenidate and it helps a lot with ADHD but I do have side effects even though my dosage is very low (I experience benefits from 2 x 5 mg), including stomach ache. I stopped taking it after just few months due to uncomfortable side effects, but mostly because of increased heart rate. It turned out I had other condition that since then is under control.   
  
Now I wanted to get back on the meds. I honestly forgot how much they help! I wish I could finally take them regularly. With extended release version most of my side effects are lessened but one - upset stomach in all possible ways. It is even worse than I remember. I don't remember it going away last time when I tried to stick it out and I don't have high hopes now either. It makes me sad because I was finally able to do some consistent work with the help of the medication but I can't function with stomach ache and nausea long term. I have healthy dietary habits and make sure my diet is balanced and nutritious.

I'm wondering if it's possible that other types of medication won't cause upset stomach? Is it worth it to make an appointment to ask for a different prescription or will all ADHD meds likely cause the same side effects?

- intense cramps that still are still lingering so much so that I limp(I’m a pro athlete so my water intake and dietary needs are not the issue)
- Confusion/delirious is almost constant. I literally got in the shower with my shoes on… and then once I took them off I still stood in the shower confused on what to do
- Extremely irritability is 24/7. Just my girlfriend saying good morning/good night or “I love you” will make me snap.
- Facial tics/muscle spasms. I could feel them and my gf literally sees my lips twitching 
- Extreme fatigue, I went 39hrs without sleeping and when I finally do get to sleep it’s late. 
- Feeling physically ill and nauseated 
- I could focus and be productive in the beginning but now I feel like I have too much to do all at once and end up getting nothing done
- VERY overstimulated which increases my anxiety
- Feels like bugs are flying on my skin so I’m constantly slapping myself. This one can be tricky though because I’m in Mexico and there are like a million mosquitos, flies, and gnats EVERYWHERE. So idk if I’m hallucinating or if they’re actually touching me.

I may be missing some side effects but yeah…",1,"##ramps, ##ics, spasms"
"My psychiatrist put me on Methylphenidate in January and I've gotten the dose upped twice, each time it helped but each time I've also settled back into what feels like a terrible apathetic depression. I should clarify **I do NOT want to change meds**, as the way in which they do still help I not only want, but need, like how they still help me find an easier time sticking with something once I start it, or how they've regulated my appetite enough to lose a significant amount of weight this year (which is needed), things I couldn't do without them.

Yes I know I should probably have asked here sooner, but haha gotta love the 'ol adhd vice of 'putting shit off till the last minute' as usual.

Now I had these moods off and on long before taking medication, and the biggest part of why I went onto meds after years of not taking them was because I just can't cope off of medication anymore, I'm too burnt out despite doing so little. My problem's that I feel too apathetic and unenthused to stay organized and do anything, it feeds back and makes me more anxious but still not motivated or focused enough to do what I need or even want to do, and then eventually I'll get depressed and even more apathetic in this awful feedback loop of doing nothing & feeling awful about doing nothing, or when I manage to do things I'll feel as if I got way too tired out from the amount I've done and struggle to do it again the next day. I should also mention I have some pretty bad social anxiety and struggle to clarify or organize my thoughts when I go to my psychiatrist appoints every few months.

Should I ask for another upped dose? Should I bring up anti-depressants? Any suggestions?

I already tried Ritalin as a child; Strattera is what put me off of meds for years, **and I will NOT go back to it.**",1,
"A month ago I started taking two x 5mg IR generic methylphenidate per day and I don't know how much of this was placebo but I thought it was amazing - I could focus, complete chores.. sometimes I got tired. But I was sure it was gonna change my life. I was euphoric at the beginning and also euphoric the first time I tried taking 3 5mg a day. 

So I increased the dose to two 10mg pills a day, and this is my third day of that and I'm SO tired. I stayed in bed a lot of the first day, and yesterday I fell asleep on the sofa in the evening, and when I woke up I went to bed and slept for 12 hours.

I just took my morning pill with breakfast and I feel so sleepy already. Really calm, but too tired. I'm trying to do some work but I can't focus. It's weird, it's like the focus is there but so is this tiredness.

I understand everyone is different, I'm just hoping to hear anyone's experiences with methylphenidate and tiredness.",1,tired
"Hi,

  
I started my titration at the beginning of July on a 30mg dose of Elvanse (Lisdexamfetamine). I didn't really notice any positives, and had some side effects which mostly trailed off after a couple of weeks of 30mg.  Unfortunately, my heart rate was consistently in the high 90s and early 100s, and I began to feel chest discomfort and a bit of a squeezing feeling in the left side of my chest.  



My titration practitioner told me to stop taking the Elvanse, and about a week later all of my side effects have gone.  She's now suggesting I look at Methylphenidate Plain (4-hour) or Meflynate XL (8-hour).  I'm happy to do the switch, but am very nervous about it since I keep seeing people complaining about Methylphenidate, and I worry that this is my only chance at getting medicated for my ADHD.  I've no known heart issues, and my resting heart rate when off medication is between 65-75, and my blood pressure is smack bang in the middle of the normal range. So i have no idea why Elvanse had such a negative impact on me.

  
Has anybody experienced similar? I don't know whether to try the 4-hour dose (2/3 times a day), as she suggested it might be better in terms of side-effects. But also I don't want to be tied in to taking 3 tablets a day for the foreseeable future!

  
If you've made the switch from Elvanse to Methylphenidate, how was your experience?",1,"chest discomfort, squeezing feeling"
"Hello,

I am a 26 year old male who was just diagnosed with ADHD about 1 month ago. My doctor prescribed me Methylphenidate Hydrochloride 10mg extended releases.  I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago so I'm familiar with taking meds an that it could take a bit to get everything sorted out. 

I've been taking the Methylphenidate as prescribed for about 26 days now and I can't say I feel any different at all. My mind is just as loud an fast as it was before taking them. I still talk alot in conversations an find myself wanting to finish people's thoughts for them. Long story short all of my symptoms persist. I haven't even noticed any negative side effects. Maybe my circadian rhythm is all over the place but I'm a late night gamer it was already screwed to begin with.

My actual question is, Is it normal to feel no effects at all initially with a newly prescribed stimulant medication?",1,
"this is a question for the science geeks but I figured we might have a few of those around here, I'm curious about the differing effects of methylphenidate and amphetamine on dopamine concentrations (I know stimulants effect norepinephrine too but I'll ignore that for now) 

from what I understand methylphenidate based drugs (ritalin, concerta etc) increase pre-frontal dopamine by inhibiting re-uptake, so it hangs around for longer basically increasing the strength of the signalling... whereas I believe amphetamines (vyvanse, adderall etc) also inhibit re-uptake whilst essentially actively stimulating the release of additional dopamine into the synaptic cleft 

(so I think amphetamines will still work when dopamine *release* is faulty as they give that a kick too, whereas methylphenidate based druggies won't necessarily be all that effective in that scenario)

anyways, I was wondering if that means amphetamine-based meds are going to be a bit more 'aggressive', pushing up dopamine concentrations higher, compared to methylphenidate based ones?

not sure if you could draw any conclusions about efficacy from that, I know behavioural research suggests both classes are largely equivalent (with a slight edge for amphetamines in adults), mostly I'm just curious and wondering if anyone knows of any interesting studies or graphs on the subject...",1,
"I’ve recently just got out on 30 mg of methylphenidate 1 time a day. The first day of taking i felt like it worked and i had clarity in my head and could communicate and keep conversations and was interested in everything.


 Ever since the first day i’ve had chest pain, i’m really bad at describing my feelings but if i could it sorta feels like pressure and it is uncomfortable doing a big inhale. My hands have been unbearably cold same with my feet even typing this now it’s like I came back from winter weather outside. I have not been eating at all no food sounds good to me, usually before the medicine i would drink 3 cups of chocolate milk daily and i haven’t even had the thought of drinking it. I already am not a fan of real food i’m a snacker and I eat a small bag of chips a day for the past week and a half and i’m still not hungry. When I do anything i always zone out for a long time till I snap out of it and it’s out of my control whether it’s reading or typing something. 

And I thought the medicine was supposed to like help me stop shaking my leg to keep me focused it had done nothing but made it way worst i will do it without noticing for 30+ minutes while i’m at my computer and i don’t notice. And my eyes also get strained pretty fast and hurts later at night. I come to reddit for maybe a better explanation/picture of what’s going on whether i need different medicine or if it’s normal please help!!!

"hello! i only started medication for my adhd a couple of months ago. my psychiatrist had been increasing my dose every few weeks since i started, but we stopped at 27mg for a while since i had to go study abroad.

i barely feel any difference while on 27mg, but the only adhd medication i brought for my time abroad are 27mg pills. has anyone tried taking x2 their dose of methylphenidate at a time? or should it only ever be x1 pill but with a higher amount of mg?",1,
"I live in The Philippines and I have recently been prescribed methylphenidate (MPH)(Concerta).  It's the only ADHD medication available in The Philippines.

My nephew in America also has ADHD, and he has tried everything and said that the only thing that really worked for him is dexmethylphenidate (D-MPH)(Focalin).

The MPH is really not doing much for me.  So I thought about D-MPH.

I did some research.  I learned that MPH is a ""racemic"" drug.  The ELI-5 for ""racemic"" is it means half of the molecules in the drug are ""left"" (L) molecules while half of the molecules are ""right"" (D) molecules, but are otherwise the same.  So 50% of MPH (Concerta) is L-MPH and 50% of MPH is D-MPH.  The important thing to note is that the L-MPH in MPH is ""pharmacologically inactive""... it's apparently just filler.

The D-MPH (Focalin) is exactly what it implies:  100% D-MPH, or in a mg-to-mg comparison, twice as strong (twice as much D-MPH) as MPH (Concerta).

So, (1) considering how I have no other options than Concerta or Ritalin in my country, and (2) I know that a close family member has had good results with Focalin, and (3) I am assuming that 2 mg of Concerta is equal to 1 mg of Focalin, can I just take twice as much Concerta as I would Focalin and consider that to be an equivalent?  I'm hoping to get a decent answer here before I go in and talk to my prescribing doctor about doubling the dose, because I am guessing that she wouldn't know much about D-MPH, since she has never prescribed it or been exposed to it professionally.",1,
"I’m prescribed 5mg adderall. Twice daily, started this last week. I noticed the exact same thing, though by day three I couldn’t notice it at all. I’m meeting with my doctor today to up the dose and see if it helps. I fell asleep an hour and a half after dosing my first two times if that’s any indication of how slow and tired it made me. Like I was insanely calm, and relaxed, and it relieved all anxiety. Nice, but I was hoping for adhd super powers like my psych described lol.",1,
"I find ritalin tends to.. make me feel tired. I'd assume it's because I have a sleep disorder. And the noise in my head and input being toned down reverses some of the reason I'm even awake. So I have to have a rather high dose of Adderall to function, i need the focus and a tid bit of stimulant.",1,tired
"This is consistent with lots of people that have ADHD. Both my older brother and I have it. He says there's nothing better than an Adderall nap and I can't understand how you would ever sleep on adderall. For some of us, the drug kicking in is an experience of power-down. As things become ordered and calm in your mind, your nervous system is able to regulate and recover - for lots of us this means naptime.",1,
"I'm in the same boat. I just started taking it as of yesterday. It's probably too soon to see much change.  I'm literally documenting all my body's reactions and logging when I take it.

Then I look back at my entries, and it all just seems to be a waste of time to make sense of what I was trying to achieve in the first place...

"Welcome to the club!

I was diagnosed at 22, started on Adderall, and then switched to Concerta about a year and a half later. I’ve been on it ever since, for a total of about eight and a half years, at various different dosages. (I’m 32 now, celebrating the ten-year anniversary of my diagnosis this summer!)

When I switched to Concerta, my psych at the time told me it takes about 90 minutes to kick in. I don’t know if I would have noticed that to the extent that I did if he hadn’t told me that, but that has certainly been my experience. I try to give myself plenty of time to wake up and get going in the morning, so from when I take my meds at 7am until I leave for work at 8:45, the meds are kicking in while I eat breakfast and pretend to do The NY Times Crossword and then shower and get dressed. So by the time I leave the house, I’m firing on all available cylinders.

I’ve never had any noticeable side effects from it. I think definitely let yourself take the adjustment period, but you don’t need to just stay home doing nothing if there are other things you want to do and feel capable of doing. 

The whole point of ADHD meds, after all, is to give your brain and your body an assist to do things that might otherwise be out of reach. And one of the coolest things about getting used to taking those ADHD meds is being able to trust yourself to do things you might not have been able to do before.

For example, before meds, I was very much an all-or-nothing person who was terrified to take breaks because I knew I’d lose any and all momentum I had. The meds let me take breaks, and I’ve learned how to adjust to that. I can work on something for a while, leave to do something else, and then come back to it later. Like, for real, not just in my idealized version of my life.

Give yourself the chance to figure out what those things are for you. Maybe that means trying to study. Maybe that means something else.

Most importantly, though, just remember to breathe. Starting meds is a big step. Sometimes it takes a while to find the right one, and the right dose.

You might find it helpful to keep a journal of what you do and when and how you’re feeling when you start the meds. It might help process your anxiety just to write it down, and it can help your prescriber figure out what (if any) adjustments to make.

Good luck!!! I’m rooting for you!!!",1,
"Concerta is fantastic, but I noticed after a month of being on it my anxiety spiked through the roof. All of my symptoms of ADHD were very well managed, but I would have panic attacks over the littlest things, overreact when driving, cry constantly because SOMETHING was always worrying me. I switched to Adderall two weeks ago and I hate it. I feel dead. I have an appt to change back to Concerta and talk about adding an anti-anxiety pill. Anyways, increased anxiety and a slight loss of appetite were the only big things I noticed. But seriously, I had no problems with my ADHD symptoms.",1,"anxiety spiked, panic attacks, over, increased anxiety, loss of appetite"
"I started on Focalin a couple of months ago, and I never got that instaproductive feel either. I still procrastinate, and I'm still annoyingly forgetful, but I've noticed that my mood and outlook are much better. I just feel generally more balanced, much less restless, and I don't ruminate all the time anymore, which is enough for me. The other stuff I can manage with strategies and accommodations. I guess it just depends on what you need out of your meds.",1,
"oh boy, yes, I feel you. titration felt to me like a very uncomfortable science experiment on my own body. I hated it and was paranoid and hyper aware of every little mood or tic or possible symptom. 

at 10 mg of Ritalin LA (methylphenidate) I felt very little difference. at 20-30 mg there were obvious changes. I started to feel like you are 'supposed to.' I had motivation to work where I used to have none, I was more social, chatty, (I'm normally super quiet), etc. But still felt there was room to grow. 

my highest dosage (40 mg methylphenidate) caused me to get a migraine every other day, otherwise, I felt great. Like I was finally the person I was supposed to be. Maybe slightly jittery at times (if I hadn't eaten before taking my meds) and had less of an appetite and slept less. I also fell into hyperfocus mode SUPER easily, which isn't great for taking care of my body. If I hadn't had the migraines I would have kept my dosage at 40 mg, though. It was on the edge of where I wanted to be. Probably 35 mg would have been perfect?

Even though it was between psychiatrist appointments, I emailed the clinic my doc is at about my migraines and they had the doctor respond / approve me lowering my dosages within a day or two. I'm now prescribed 20 mg in the am and 10 mg in the pm because one dose of 30 mg doesn't get me through the whole day but 40 (30 mg in the am and 10 mg in the pm) is too much for my body to handle in one day. 

if you can, keep a careful record of what you feel when. if it is a pattern or you are at all uncomfortable, let your doc know and they can recommend what to do.",1,migraine
"Been wondering myself what the signs are of too high or too low a dose. I'm on Concerta 18mg per day. At first, I feel great when it kicks in (focused and motivated). After a few hours I feel a bit hyper. However, when the medications reaches it's second peak (somewhere after 5-6 hours) I've found myself regularly feeling overwhelmed and unfocused, and like I need to stop doing things because I just cannot function as well. 

Not sure whether to switch to low dose instant release.
Has anyone else had a similar experience?",1,"##yper, overwhelmed, unfocused"
"Today my patient told me that they recently strained their neck while playing disc golf. They met with a chiropractor who told them that their stimulant (Methylphenidate) for their ADHD is likely lowering their magnesium level, and that they should switch stimulants.

Does anyone know if this is a reasonable concern worth investigating, or was his chiropractor just playing doctor?",1,"strained, neck, lowering, magnesium level, magnesium"
"# Exercise

A meta-analysis of ten studies with 300 children found exercise moderately reduced ADHD symptoms, but had no significant effect after correcting for publication bias ([Vysniauske et al., 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1087054715627489)).

Another meta-analysis found no significant effect of exercise on either inattention (6 studies, 277 participants) or hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms (4 studies, 227 participants), but significant reductions in depression and anxiety (5 studies, 164 participants) ([Zang, 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6867774/)).

A meta-analysis of 15 studies with 734 children found physical exercise interventions effective in temporarily reducing symptoms ([Sun et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178122001238?via%3Dihub)).

# Meditation

A meta-analysis of 12 studies and 579 participants suggested moderate reductions in ADHD symptoms in both adults (6 RCTs, 339 participants) and children and adolescents (6 RCTs, 240 participants), but half the studies did not employ active controls. Removing studies with waiting list controls made the results nonsignificant. The authors concluded: “there is insufficient methodologically sound evidence to support the recommendation of meditation-based therapies as an intervention aimed to target ADHD core symptoms or related neuropsychological dysfunctions in children/adolescents or adults with ADHD” ([Zhang et al., 2018](https://mentalhealth.bmj.com/content/21/3/87.abstract)).

# Caffeine

The most current meta-analysis available concluded no significant effects of caffeine on ADHD symptoms ([Perrotte et al., 2023](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/13/9/1304)). Research suggests caffeine helps with alertness and vigilance, but not the kind of inattention implicated in ADHD (sustained attention/future directed persistence).

(**More research is needed)**

# Supplementation and diet

A meta-analysis with 16 studies with 1408 participants found omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was associated with small improvements in ADHD symptoms ([Chang et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2017160)).

Another meta-analysis, with 18 studies and a total 1640 participants, found tiny improvements ([Puri and Martins, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952327814000180)).

Another meta-analysis of 22 studies with 1789 participants found insignificant short-term effects, but long-term supplementation may result in tiny to small reductions in symptoms ([Liu et al., 2023](https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/omega-3-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-core-symptoms-adhd-meta-analysis-randomized-controlled-trials/)).

Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was associated with small-to-modest improvements in ADHD symptoms in two other meta-analyses (10 studies with 699 participants, 7 studies with 534 participants) especially with high EPA ratio ([Bloch and Qawasmi, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890856711004849); [Hawkey and Nigg, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735814000749)).

A meta-analysis combining findings from 5 double-blind crossover studies with 164 participants found that the restriction of synthetic food colours from children's diets was linked to tiny to small reductions in ADHD symptoms ([Nigg et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890856711009531)).

In a meta-analysis encompassing 15 double-blind placebo-controlled trials with 219 participants, exposure to artificial food colourants were associated with a small increase in disinhibitory (hyperactivity/impulsivity) symptoms among children ([Schab and Trinh, 2004](https://journals.lww.com/jrnldbp/abstract/2004/12000/do_artificial_food_colors_promote_hyperactivity_in.7.aspx)).

Another meta-analysis covering 20 studies with almost 800 participants, identified a tiny increase in ADHD symptoms albeit only when assessed by parents and not other observers ([Nigg et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890856711009531)).

A nationwide population study using the Swedish Twin Register identified almost 18,000 twins who completed a web-based survey examining the relationship between inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity presentations and dietary habits. The two presentations of ADHD exhibited very similar associations. Both had significant associations with unhealthy diets; were more likely to be eating foods high in added sugar and neglecting fruits and vegetables while eating more meat and fats. After adjusting for degree of relatedness of twins (whether monozygotic or dizygotic) and controlling for the other ADHD presentation, the associations remained statistically significant for inattention, but diminished to negligible levels or became statistically nonsignificant for hyperactivity/impulsivity. Even for persons with inattention symptoms, adjusted correlations were very small (never exceeding r = 0.10), with the strongest associations being for overall unhealthy eating habits and eating foods high in added sugar. Among over 700 pairs of monozygotic (“identical”) twins, it found very small associations between inattention symptoms and unhealthy eating habits. For hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms, the association with unhealthy eating habits was even weaker. The association with consumption of foods high in added sugar became statistically insignificant ([Li et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976342100049X#bib0925)).

A meta-analysis combining seven studies with a cumulative participant pool exceeding 25,000 from six countries across three continents found no evidence of an association between sugar consumption and ADHD in youth ([Farsad-Naeimi et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229919320540)).

# Neurofeedback & cognitive training

Multiple meta-analyses were published by the European ADHD Guidelines Group on cognitive training and neurofeedback interventions for youth. In studies where cognitive training was likely conducted with blinded evaluators and active controls (6 studies, almost 300 youths), found no significant reduction in ADHD symptoms. There were no significant effects on academic outcomes in reading and maths ([Cortese et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856714008892)). In blinded neurofeedback studies with active/sham controls (6 studies, 251 participants), there was no significant reduction in ADHD symptoms ([Cortese et al., 2016a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890856716300958)).

Another meta-analysis of 5 randomised controlled trials with 263 participants, investigating the effectiveness of neurofeedback, found a minor reduction in inattention. However, there was no noteworthy reduction in hyperactivity-impulsivity or overall symptoms of ADHD as assessed by presumably blinded evaluators (researchers responsible for measuring outcomes were unaware of whether patients were undergoing the active or control treatment) ([Micoulaud-Franchi et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00906/full)).

# Behaviour modification

A meta-analysis of 19 studies with almost 900 adults found cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) associated with moderate improvements in self-reported ADHD symptoms and self-reported functioning. However, when limited to the two studies with active controls and blind assessors (244 participants), it found only small improvements ([Knouse et al., 2017](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-21394-001)).

Another meta-analysis in three studies of 191 patients found CBT led to modest improvements when compared with active controls ([Young et al., 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1087054716664413)).

A meta-analysis of 19 studies and over 2200 youths with ADHD found that social skills training did not improve teacher-assessed social skills, school performance, academic achievement or classroom manageability ([Storebo et al., 2019](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008223.pub3/full)).

# Medication

A meta-analysis of 18 studies with over 2000 adults found three amphetamine derivatives (dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine and mixed amphetamine salts) produced moderate to large reductions in ADHD symptoms ([Castells et al., 2011](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007813.pub3/full)).

A meta-analysis of 19 studies with over 1600 participants found that methylphenidate moderately reduced ADHD symptoms ([Storebø et al., 2015](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009885.pub3/abstract)).

A meta-analysis of 7 studies with over 1600 participants found that atomoxetine moderately reduced ADHD symptoms ([Cheng et al., 2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-007-0840-x)).

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 345 participants found that guanfacine XR modestly reduced ADHD symptoms ([Biederman et al., 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18166547/)).

A meta-analysis found that lisdexamfetamine (5 studies, over 2300 adults), atomoxetine (3 studies, 237 adults) and methylphenidate (13 studies, over 2200 adults) result in small to modest reductions in symptoms of emotional dysregulation ([Lenzi et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763417304438)).

Another meta-analysis covering 9 studies with over 1300 youths reported atomoxetine to be associated with modest reductions in emotional symptoms ([Schwartz and Correll, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890856713008149)).

Three meta-analyses (9 studies with 2762 participants; 11 studies with 2772 participants; 7 studies with 1368 participants) ([Hanwella et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229459/#:~:text=Meta%2Danalysis%20did%20not%20find,1.14%2C%20p%20%3D%200.49); [Rezaei et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4898838/); [Hazell et al., 2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1087054710379737)) found methylphenidate and atomoxetine have comparable efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of ADHD. In another (network) meta-analysis, efficacy and tolerability were equivalent ([Bushe et al., 2016](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881116636105)).

A meta-analysis of 20 studies found lisdexamfetamine modestly more effective than methylphenidate at reducing symptoms; slightly more effective than mixed amphetamine salts. Modafinil was ineffective ([Stuhec et al., 2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1060028018795703)).

A meta-analysis combining 4 studies with 216 youths found mixed amphetamine salts slightly more effective than methylphenidate ([Faraone et al., 2002](https://journals.lww.com/psychopharmacology/abstract/2002/10000/comparative_efficacy_of_adderall_and.5.aspx)).

# Conclusions

* Medication (stimulants: amphetamines, methylphenidate; non-stimulants: atomoxetine) produce moderate to large reductions in symptoms; for guanfacine XR (alpha-2a agonist), the reductions are modest.
* For the treatment of ADHD atomoxetine and methylphenidate have comparable efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. 
* Amphetamines tend to be modestly more effective than methylphenidate and atomoxetine but also potentiate higher incidence of side effects.
* The stimulants (amphetamine, methylphenidate) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine) are modestly more effective than the alpha-2 agonists (guanfacine XR) but the formest are also more likely to be diverted, misused, and abused.
* Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is modestly effective for reducing symptoms. It works best as an adjunct to medication.
* It's unknown whether meditation-based therapies are effective; the evidence is insufficent to support its recommendation.
* ADHD is linked to poor treatment response to social skills training.
* Neurofeedback and cognitive training interventions are ineffective for ADHD.
* No special diet has been shown to improve symptoms, with two exceptions: supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids or eliminating exposure to artificial food colourants both independently result in small improvements. However, they have a very small magnitude of effect compared to primary treatments. On a scale of one to ten, if we define the effect of ADHD medications as 7-9 and the combined effects of CBT, environmental modification and accommodations as 5, dietary changes would be rated 2 ([Faraone & Antshel, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1056499314000601?via%3Dihub)).
* Sugar consumption does not cause ADHD.
* Unhealthy eating habits do not exacerbate ADHD symptoms.
* Evidence is conflicting on whether exercise has specific effects on ADHD.

"# Atomoxetine compared to methylphenidate

A meta-analysis of 9 studies with 2,762 participants found no significant difference in efficacy, response rate and tolerability between atomoxetine and methylphenidate, although OROS methylphenidate produces slightly superior benefit over atomoxetine ([Hanwella et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229459/#:~:text=Meta%2Danalysis%20did%20not%20find,1.14%2C%20p%20%3D%200.49)).

A meta-analysis of 11 studies with a total of 2,772 participants found atomoxetine and methylphenidate produce comparable efficacy and acceptability in the treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD, although OROS methylphenidate produces a significant superior benefit over atomoxetine ([Rezaei et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4898838/)).

A meta-analysis of 7 studies with 1,368 participants found that after 6 weeks of treatment atomoxetine and methylphenidate had comparable efficacy in reducing core ADHD symptoms ([Hazell et al., 2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1087054710379737)).

A network meta-analysis found no significant difference in the efficacy and discontinuation rate between OROS methylphenidate and atomoxetine in adults ([Bushe et al., 2016](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881116636105)).

# Atomoxetine, methylphenidate and amphetamines compared

A meta-analysis of 20 studies found lisdexamfetamine modestly more effective than methylphenidate at reducing symptoms; slightly more effective than mixed amphetamine salts. Modafinil was ineffective ([Stuhec et al., 2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1060028018795703)).

An initial analysis suggested that amphetamine (Adderall) is modestly more effective than methylphenidate preparations ([Faraone et al., 2001](https://www.proquest.com/openview/06973ba061d32bb8d002b28be2732d39/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=46504)).

A subsequent meta-analysis combining 4 studies with 216 youths found mixed amphetamine salts slightly more effective than methylphenidate ([Faraone et al., 2002](https://journals.lww.com/psychopharmacology/abstract/2002/10000/comparative_efficacy_of_adderall_and.5.aspx)).

An analysis of 18 day randomised control trial of school children found mixed amphetamine salts to be significantly more effective than extended-release atomoxetine in improving classroom behaviour ([Biederman et al., 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149291806000488)).

# Emotional dysregulation

A meta-analysis found that lisdexamfetamine (5 studies, over 2300 adults), atomoxetine (3 studies, 237 adults) and methylphenidate (13 studies, over 2200 adults) result in small to modest reductions in symptoms of emotional dysregulation ([Lenzi et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763417304438)).

Another meta-analysis covering 9 studies with over 1300 youths reported atomoxetine to be associated with modest reductions in emotional symptoms ([Schwartz and Correll, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890856713008149)).

# Anxiety

A clinical study of 70 participants found that atomoxetine is more effective than methylphenidate at reducing anxiety symptoms ([Snircova et al., 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ped.12847)).

A randomised clinical trial of 76 participants found that atomoxetine is more effective than methylphenidate alone at reducing anxiety symptoms. When fluoxetine (a SSRI) and methylphenidate were combined, they were equivalent in efficacy to atomoxetine ([Karbasi, Aghili., 2023](https://brieflands.com/articles/ijpbs-135121)).

(**Additional research is needed)**

# Articulation & reading

A double blind randomised control trial of 100 participants found that atomoxetine improves articulation ([Ahmadabadi et al., 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9531205/)).

A randomised placebo-controlled trial of 209 participants found that atomoxetine improved critical components of reading, including decoding and reading vocabulary in youth with dyslexia distinct from improvement in ADHD inattention symptoms ([Shaywitz et al., 2017](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/cap.2015.0189)).

**(Additional research is needed)**

# Cognitive disengagement syndrome

Controlled clinical trials suggest that atomoxetine (209 youth) ([Wietecha et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27845858/)) and lisdexamfetamine (38 adults) ([Adler et al., 2021](https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/a-placebo-controlled-trial-of-lisdexamfetamine-in-the-treatment-of-comorbid-sluggish-cognitive-tempo-and-adult-adhd/)) are associated with moderate reductions in CDS symptoms independent of ADHD inattention; for methylphenidate (almost 200 youth) the reductions were tiny or insignificant ([Firat et al., 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1087054720902846)).

A randomised placebo-controlled trial with 171 youth reported CDS to be associated with a poor treatment response rate to methylphenidate ([Froehlich, Becker et al., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6558969/)).

A clinical trial with 40 children found specifically ADHD-IN/CDS symptoms linked to a poor treatment response (20%) to methylphenidate; for those who responded, the benefits were small and low doses were best ([Barkley et al., 1991](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2011430/)). The significant results are likely linked to CDS ([Barkley, 2014](https://www.peterraabe.ca/docs/SCT_Barkley.pdf)).

(**Much further research is needed; we have so little research on medications for CDS that one simply cannot ascertain with confidence what will help treat it).**

International Consensus Statement on CDS as a distinct syndrome ([Becker, Barkley et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856722012461)).

# Presence of comorbid math disorder

A random crossover trial found that the presence of a comorbid learning disability, especially in mathematics greatly reduces methylphenidate response (37% vs 75%) ([Grizenko et al., 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1325066/)). The reasons for that are not clear. One possibility is that an acquired etiology of ADHD is a predictor of a math disorder - acquired cases with detectable brain damage to the EF networks (as a result of exposure to biohazards during pregnancy, traumatic brain injury) seem to be less responsive to medication.

**(Additional research is needed - its unknown whether this applies to other medications)**

# Conclusions

* For the treatment of ADHD atomoxetine and methylphenidate have comparable efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. Amphetamines are more potent and tend to be modestly more effective than methylphenidate and atomoxetine but also potentiate more side effects.
* For the treatment of emotional dysregulation specifically, the stimulants (amphetamine, methylphenidate) and atomoxetine lead to small to modest improvements.
* Studies indicate that atomoxetine is more effective than methylphenidate at reducing anxiety symptoms.
* The type of attention disorder is important. CDS is linked to poor treatment response to methylphenidate.
* Atomoxetine may be preferred over methylphenidate due to its superior duration of effect and superiority in the treatment of comorbid anxiety disorders.

"I was diagnosed as being dysthymic ~15 years ago.  Basically, I had graduated from college but was going nowhere, living in my parents' basement, and was deeply unhappy.

I visited a psychiatrist who I still see.  I tried some anti-depressants and eventually we settled on Bupropion (Wellbutrin XL).  I had good results with sertraline (Zoloft) but didn't like the sexual side effects.  Bupropion worked very well.  After a few months, I was up and ready to take on the world, took a temp job that turned into a permanent job (which I still have), bought a house, etc.  and was generally successfully moving forward with life.  Over time, I eventually added a stimulant as an adjunct to the bupropion - methylphenidate, adderall, and so on.  These seemed to help in terms of increasing the bupropion's effects and with other beneficial side effects - e.g. focus and energy.  Over the past five years, I've become increasingly less happy, mostly because I still really have no emotions and no ability to connect with other people or develop any relationships at all (let alone meaningful ones).

I've been a daily alcohol consumer (6-12+ drinks a day, no more than a day or two without) the whole time I've been seeing my psychiatrist.  When discussing this recent ""the drugs don't seem to be working any more"" phenomenon, that was the first thing we discussed - i.e. is the alcohol consumption inhibiting the ability of the anti-depressant to continue doing its job?  I was open to that idea and started an intensive outpatient program.  I've been alcohol-free for 37 days.  Problem is, I'm not seeing any results in terms of mood/life improvement.  And now that I'm thinking about it more, it doesn't really make sense that the alcohol was the reason for the problem.  This is not to say alcohol consumption isn't in itself problematic, just that the bupropion and adjuncts worked perfectly well during the period of daily alcohol consumption.  It's too early to make any final determination - of course it's possible that there's some sort of lingering effect from the alcohol consumption that will take longer to resolve - but I really don't want to just wait a while to see if that's the case.  I want to be more proactive.

I've recently done some work with a therapist and the outcome has been an increased realization that I'm incredibly angular.  By that I mean I'm very successful in some areas - e.g. work - and yet very unsuccessful in other areas - e.g. interpersonal/relationships.  I was doing some web reading, searching around for ideas, when a notion hit me.  I started thinking about whether a low dose of an SSRI combined with bupropion would be effective.  The problem with SSRIs is that the sexual side effects are bad, so I thought maybe a very low dose would be enough to avoid having those too badly while reaping at least some benefit from the SSRI.  I then started thinking about the various neurotransmitters, what they do, and how that might impact where I am and where I might want to go.

Bupropion is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor.  According to Wikipedia, ""the general function of norepinephrine is to mobilize the brain and body for action"" and more specifically, norepinephrine ""increases arousal and alertness, promotes vigilence, enhances formation and retrieval of memory, and focuses attention"".  That's basically a lot of things that contribute to one's ability to work.  That makes sense; when I started taking bupropion, I went from lying around to going out and working and getting ahead in a job.  And dopamine is most prominently associated with reward.  Both of those seem to really apply to me - I've been really successful at my job, yet I don't really have any drive to ""fill in the gaps"", and I think the dopamine reuptake could be associated with the latter.  Basically, the bupropion is making me good at work but inhibiting me from filling out the rest of my life because moment to moment the increased dopamine is making my brain think things are good.  And none of those neurotransmitters really seems to impact mood, emotion, feeling, social function, etc.

Where I'm at now is thinking that an SSRI could help fill in those gaps.  It's harder to get a read on serotonin, but it appears a lot of research points to it being important in mood and social function.  My current thinking is that if it's safe to augment the bupropion with an SSRI at levels low enough to avoid bad sexual dysfunction, but high enough to get a serotonin boost, that might alleviate some of the ""no interest in social life at all"" I'm seeing and ""fill in the gap"" that's not being helped by bupropion and its effect on norepinephrine and dopamine.

Im curious to hear any thoughts.  I'd of course discuss all of this with my psychiatrist, but as we're a few weeks away from an appointment and there's no emergency, I thought I might bounce the idea here and see what people think.  Am I basically on the right track with the notion that bupropion could take a depressed person and make them very effective at work without really impacting their ability to develop a happy social life?  Is it possible to get some benefit from SSRIs at a level that's low enough to keep sexual side effects to a minimum?  Is there any clinical experience or research in terms of a bupropion/SSRI combo?  My reading suggests it should be OK since they're impacting on different neurotransmitters, but I'm in no way a professional.  

I hope this is OK in terms of the posting rules.  I'm not asking for specific medical advice, just some feedback on ideas; hopefully that's OK.

"That’s an interesting observation, but it runs counter to a trend that we observe— particularly with our emotionally immature kiddos with ADHD, and even more so with my young boys.

Focalin does have less appetite suppression and insomnia than Adderall, true, but is also *much* more likely to have associated agitation in the afternoon.  The emotional aspect is much more difficult for my families to deal with— they are acclimated to the hyperactivity by the time they see me.  What upsets my families— particularly the fathers— is when their sons suddenly start to cry when the mean girl in the class insults their Spider-Man shoes.

It takes time to establish rapport with the families, and time to discuss emotional issues.

YMMV.",1,"appetite suppression, insomnia, agitation"

"So I’m diagnosed adhd, but I can personally attest that pre medication it was caffeine putting me to sleep. I have a vivid memory of deciding to grab breakfast with a friend one day right before my last lecture with my (at the time, but still top 5) fave prof; I had one coffee at brunch, but when I got to class at 1:30 pm 20 mins later I was struggling to stay awake. Straight up seeing neon on my page from how sleepy I was, even though I was fully alert 20 mins earlier. It wore off by about 3 pm, or two hours after that cup of coffee, and I was suddenly alert again. I only started to be able to drink coffee without falling asleep 90% of the time after being medicated. Imo, it was also a “coffee” thing, not just caffeine: I could fall asleep after just about any amount of caffeine, but strongly brewed teas did not put me into the same slumber. Energy drinks too were better, but did put me to sleep if I was already tired. Granted, if I was tired I was most likely just going to sleep so that’s besides the point.

Not a psychiatrist btw (premed EMT lurker here 👀) but I am surprised by the general trend of responses on this thread. Ofc patients lie, and they lie all the time, and yeah some may not “need” the drug or end up diverting (whether or not they themselves need it), but I would at least ask further questions about stimulant responses. I’m not a diagnostician, but in my fairly limited social experience of having adhd, seeing ppl who want drugs, knowing/seeing/treating drug users, etc stimulant response has tracked fairly consistently with people who end up diagnosed with adhd vs not. It also tracks in my family history, where my father is exactly the same as me with coffee and tea, while my mother isn’t: my dad is also a poster child of adhd (doesn’t believe in the disorder bc “it’s normal”) while my mother doesn’t seem to have it, and the difference on other metrics is obvious. Sedating stimulant response always makes me think potential adhd, since even stimulant tolerance doesn’t tend to present itself like this. If you compare my cousin (no adhd, she frequently would get mildly frustrated with my adhd traits but “learned to accept them”) and me on a stimulant, it’s a markedly different profile despite a body weight diff of +/- 1kg. She has a positive response to it, it makes her happy, chatty, active, constantly moving around and unable to sit still; on the same dose (recreational, ie higher than therapeutic) I tend to feel a little jittery, tired, and either watching the clouds move or playing sudoku or some other inane task. She struggled with stimulant abuse and addiction, whereas I forget to take my meds roughly three times a week. I’ve managed to keep my tolerance down and my dose minimal, but adhd medication improved my quality of life 80% when I started it.

"Speaking here as a patient!

At a certain amount some stimulants have made me experience a sedated affect that I can only describe as becoming a flatlander. Everything was flat, unable to experience anything other than a numb, comfortable but tired and dull state.

Focalin was the main culprit but Adderall did this once too when I had been prescribed too much without a break (Medicated since early 200ps).

"I've mentioned this already, you're missing the point of what a disorder is according to the DSM. It must be significantly impairing in certain domains of life and cause the person distress. Sure, anyone can have some noise going on in their head at times. However, there is an immense difference between taking something to help you do something better and going from being unable to do something, experiencing all of the attendant and often serious consequences, and suddenly becoming functional at that thing. I'm not making any assumptions about or placing any value on the ADHD brain. I follow what scientific research says on the matter. You're the one inserting your own opinions on this and making it a speculative issue. 

What I said about 30 mg dextroamphetamine also applies to a moderate dose of 20 mg. Tolerance is not what makes the difference. It's completely possible for a patient to be prescribed a limited amount of 30 mg of Vyvanse, mix the capsules' contents into a solution at varying concentrations, try a different dose each day, find their effective dose, and meet with their doctor again at the end of the week to discuss the results. That's not recommended and is just for illustrative purposes (although it has been done and was perfectly tolerable), but look at the actual recommended titration schedule for Vyvanse to see that tolerance is not necessary to explain anything. The starting dose, even in children with ADHD, is 30 mg, which can then be increased by 20 mg every week after. That means it's acceptable and well tolerated to start at 30 mg and reach 70 mg (the max dose) after only 2 weeks. Vyvanse has a bit less d-AMP than something like Dexedrine, but it still makes the point that tolerance is not responsible as you claim. I started at 30 mg myself and can confirm it's not the way you're thinking it is.",1,

Now how do you suppose that person B who hasn't ADHD will (authentically) respond.

So, contextual... Not profoundness... What? Are you seriously thinking that I'm suggesting we deal out amphetamines and then have a questionnaire with one question: ""On a scale from 1-10, how calm did you feel?"" - ""Okay! You scored 8, then you probably have ADHD... Congratulations!""

I am well aware of any possible misgivings in that exact theoretical setting as well, but the point still remains - there is a **substantial difference** in the experience. That's what I was arguing for...

"Hi 👋 me again,

So I have a question, I’m in a process of ADHD diagnosis and it’s most likely atp that I have ADHD, I was talking already with my therapist about meds option when it comes to ADHD. 

So my question - maybe someone is taking Zoloft (I’m on 75 mg) and methylphenidate and can tell me how are you feeling, I saw on the internet that sometimes this “combo” can cause serotonin syndrome. 

I’m a little bit scared so 😅",1,serotonin syndrome
"edit: Sorry for my bad writing, I'm experiencing withdrawal effects and they make me a little dumb.

Hi! I'm a high school junior and I've been taking Concerta (54 mg) for 3 months for ADHD. I'm also prescribed Ritalin for after school use but haven't used it yet. Meds have changed my life - they have been really helpful. 54 mg is the best dosage so far and I'm happy with it. But meds also caused some issues like insomnia, anxiety, and the sometimes feeling of exhaustion. 

In my last appointment, my psychiatrist wanted to talk about my exams and other experiences after starting meds. As much as I can study now, there haven't been any improvements in my exam results. He asked if I'm perfectionist and I answered yes. He asked if I experienced any anxious feelings during exams, had racing heart, obsessions, self confidence etc. 

 I don't feel anxious except the last 10 minutes of the exams. I experienced heart palpitations in the first month after I upped to 54 mg. And I don't have any confidence issues. I experience the anxiety caused by meds but I manage it, it's nothing more than anxiety caused by coffee. There haven't been any issues besides that school caused extreme emotional damage until I got used to school after midterm holiday and my new dosage. 

He said that he thinks meds cause too much anxiety on me, that I'm a really detailer person, exhausted feelings are a serious matter, I shouldn't work on too many fields etc. He mentioned some notes from past appointments as an example. He said I work too hard and set superordinate goals, which he thinks is worrying.  And he prescribed me Selectra (Sertraline) 50 mg for anxiety. I haven't ever thought that I might have anxiety and I'm mostly happy with my life. I solved many of my problems. I can make real progress. I'm hopeful about my future. 

That's why the prescription surprised me. I feel like he might have manipulated me to say things that meet the diagnosis criteria for anxiety. Because I many times said there hasn't been any significant increase in my anxious feeling before/after ADHD meds. I also feel like he could be right, I really push my self too much for success. ADHD meds have been helpful and sertraline may be helpful too. But, I'm also afraid of possible negative effects of it if it's mis-prescribed. I don't what to do, could use any advice.",1,"racing heart, heart palpitations, negative effects"
"I have two quick questions; I apologize because I recognize that they're hypothetical and might be hard to answer. I obviously won't treat any of the responses (that you guys provide) as medical advice or anything, so don't worry about that; people sometimes think that I'm asking stuff in order to get advice on which I'm going to act, but I talk things over with a psychiatrist before taking any action, so I'm not someone who goes and recklessly acts based on internet comments. 

First, suppose you quit escitalopram cold-turkey from a high dose like 20mg. That's likely to yield a terrible withdrawal, I assume. But what if you *almost* quit cold-turkey but leave a small dose of escitalopram in place...how much is leaving that small dose in place likely to reduce the negative impact of withdrawal? 

Second, if you're on just escitalopram and nothing else and you quit cold-turkey from a high dose like 20mg...again, that's likely to yield a terrible withdrawal, I assume. But what if you're also taking methylphenidate? Could methylphenidate act in any way to ""soften the blow"" of escitalopram withdrawal? I suppose that if it were true (that you could ""soften the blow"" of the withdrawal) then it would be a well-known thing and everyone would be doing it in order to get off antidepressants.",1,

* We're [plural](https://pluralpedia.org/w/Plurality).
* We've struggled with depression for many, many years.
* We're [AuDHD](https://embrace-autism.com/an-introduction-to-audhd/) (autistic and ADHD). We already have the formal [ASD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism) diagnosis, but are still waiting on the ADHD one, so we don't have access to prescription-only ADHD meds.

We were previously on venlafaxine ([SNRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin%E2%80%93norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor)) extended release and gradually went all the way up to max dose (375 mg daily). Despite the side effects, especially the dreams, it worked well at treating our depression for a while.

Once that stopped helping, and our anxiety and executive dysfunction were on the rise, we slowly lowered our dose (not fun, even at 12.5 mg every 2 days), then cross tapered to sertraline ([SSRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor)), starting at 50 mg, increasing to 75 mg, then settling at 100 mg.

We knew this wouldn't be enough alone, so once we were settled on 100 mg sertraline, we added 150 mg bupropion ([NDRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine%E2%80%93dopamine_reuptake_inhibitor)) extended release alongside. We then increased the sertraline dose to 150 mg.

For a while, this helped massively with our depression, anxiety, energy level, and executive function.

However, due to a combination of factors outside of our control (e.g , the state of the world; increasing bigotry; regressive politics; our charity employer increasingly doing unethical, illogical, and infuriating things that affected colleagues and our supporters, etc.), we reached breaking point. 

We'd already reached [AuDHD burnout](https://embrace-autism.com/coping-with-audhd-burnout/), but we kept trying to keep muddling through, hoping for internal changes at work. These didn't emerge, and we're now taking some paid sick leave before we say or do something that might get us dismissed. 

We're settling in on 200 mg sertraline now and looking forward to a future where we might have to stop taking the bupropion in order to take an ADHD med.

The best candidate we've seen so far is [atomoxetine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomoxetine). It's an [sNRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor), not to be confused with an SNRI, so it mostly increases noradrenaline and dopamine levels, and it shows a lower risk profile of combining with sertraline than bupropion:

* [Sertraline and bupropion](https://www.drugs.com/interactions-check.php?drug_list=440-0,2057-0)
* [Sertraline and atomoxetine](https://www.drugs.com/interactions-check.php?drug_list=275-0,2057-0)

Our other options to replace bupropion aren't awful, but aren't great due to much shorter elimination half lives, even in extended-release forms: [methylphenidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) or [lisdexamfetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisdexamfetamine).

"I recently started taking escitalopram oxalate, 10mg per day. I also take 50-70mg/day methylphenidate hydrochloride for ADHD.

I feel SO GOOD since starting the escitalopram! I went from feeling like a useless piece of crap to feeling like a winner in life. I feel like I am in control, a feeling I don't recall having before in my life. I feel significantly more self-confident, happy, and I have this euphoric tingly feeling in my chest for many hours during the day. I am more bubbly / loud in social situations, I have more energy, more confidence, more YEAH!

I definitely feel ""activated"" in a way I don't remember myself feeling for years. I find myself walking faster, doing things faster in general (like packing things, tidying things etc). I grind my teeth more and have this flushed feeling in my face, and they seem to correlate with the amount of euphoria and stimulation I feel throughout the day.

While methylphenidate alone gave me euphoria and stimulation before, escitalopram potentiated these effects of methylphenidate so greatly that it's insane. I feel like I can explode from euphoria and a general feeling of wellbeing and happiness. I feel like my classmates in college are cute and are like my friends/family and I want to talk to them more - I feel closer to them, not like a weirdo alien that I am used to feel!

I still have the issue of being tired throughout the day, and having some social anxiety - but both are better than before! I know many people say escitalopram makes them tired, but I feel the opposite! I'm so much more alive and present! I sleep 5-6 hours a night now, just like before - no negative effect on my sleep (I struggle with chronic insomnia). 

The only side effects are noticed are decreased libido (as expected, but methylphenidate partially attenuates the impairment) and urinary urgency/frequency, like some sort of overactive bladder. The help for my depression is so good, though, that I have zero intention of getting off this wonder drug!",1,"urinary urgency, frequency"
"Hello! Since I read that Vortioxetine is a great medication for anhedonia and apathy and is less likely to cause sexual side effects than ssris,I decided to switch to it. I started taking Vortioxetine 10mg combined with Modafinil 100mg since wellbutrin + modafinil was not working.Methylphenidate is here to take as needed,but doc recommended to take one tablet of 10mg after lunch. So,after 2 days,apathy has been reduced,anhedonia as well.Not so much,since it has been only 2 days. Anxiety is zero.Nausea has been present but i’m taking anti-nausea medication.Looking forward to continue this combo! If I do not get remission,doctor said that I will add either Mirtazapine or Nortriptyline(because I refuse common SSRIs).But there is a chance that I could accept Fluvoxamine!

"I have endogenous melancholic depression. I am already prescribed Bupropion (Wellbutrin) for my depression and it has worked well, but I am still experiencing less than ideal levels of fatigue and occasional episodes of anhedonia. My boyfriend offered me to try his prescribed methylphenidate (ritalin, rubifen, etc) on the days that I have been especially tired and it has been a godsend. The combination of methylphenidate and bupropion has greatly improved my function and eliminated the brain fog that I had been experiencing. 

  
I'm wondering if there's any point in asking my doctor for a prescription for methylphenidate. I've looked up online that methylphenidate is prescribed in some cases of treatment resistant depression, especially for melancholic and bipolar depression. So it is possible for it to be prescribed for my depression. But i'm scared that as soon as I ask for this medication, I'm just going to be labelled a drug seeker and never have a chance of being prescribed.

-Autism

-Low mood often

-low motivation

This is quite a unique personality profile - do you know anyone else with similar vibes and what has worked for them? 
Or reccomendations on where else to post? 

And other good descriptors I could use to put these diagnoses and symptoms together esp when talking to psych?

Have tried following - WHAT DO MY RESPONSES TELL US ABOUT MY BRAIN AND TYPE in ways that could guide finding the right type of treatment? 

-atomoxetine (ADHD) - didn't help and made me aggressive (what can this teach us/rule out re what could work?) 

-methylphenidate (ADHD) - made me hyperfocus on procrastinations and distractions to detriment of productivity (Internet wiki rabbit holes etc) 

-St John's Wort (briefly)

-lisdexamfetamine and dexamphetamine (ADHD) - not depressed, easily motivated, but more because compelled to do work. Can't relax or do anything non-productive.

 \>CAN'T SOCIALISE - robot mode - too analytical (hypes up my autism) 

\>EXTREME CRASH after use 

\>insomnia (already struggle with) 

.......

Medication / side effect preferences :

Really don't want sexual side effects or weight gain as struggle with those a lot due to self esteem and high self awareness. 

This makes me think Bupropion, but I can only see a consultant psychiatrist on the mental health team (NHS England) immediately. Doubt they will prescribe even though best option (unless any tips?). Have to wait for other psych. 

What else can I take? 

I have a fair amount of ups and downs that you could call mild schizoaffective. But also could see through the lens of ADHD hyperfocus and then crash. Also depression. 

I'm mildly schizotypal but nothing major so don't know if would benefit from anything mainly aimed at that. I don't have hallucinations or voices but I do get very paranoid about people looking at me in public and the way I act in social situations or in public. Also paranoid about making noises in my room and what my housemates think of me - paranoid they might hear x and think y

I'm very self-centred yet my life is too reactionary. I spend all my mental energy thinking about what other people want and how they view me/my actions. People pleaser. 
....
What meds or combinations of meds could help? And how could I get this in the UK non-pivately (extreme waiting list for proper psychiatry NHS). 

Would any antidepressants / mood stabilisers / anxiolitics combines with the lisdexamfetamine to make me less robotic and analytical and allow me to switch off and socialise too? Though would rather disregard the dex. 
Do think the ADD worsens everything else though.",1,verbal diarrhoea
"Im 22 and have been suffering from severe depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old. I tried 2 depth psychological therapies, one behavioral one and over 13 different meds (SSRI, SNRI, atypical, tetracyclic, moclobemide, neuroleptics) without any success. Nothing helped.

The social anxiety is one of the biggest sources of my depression and personal main issues. SAD causes me to not go out, not experience anything or new things, not meet people, not socialize, not getting real friends or romantic relationships. By that it kills my self esteem, future perspectives and mood/will to live longer. These were just some examples but all the restrictions you can think of caused by SAD are big contributors to my depression & self esteem. 

Im on Mirtazapine now and while its the only one that had a tiny bit effect at least (better sleep, better appetite) I still suffer a lot of daily pain from the moment I open my eyes in the morning to the moment when I close my eyes and lay in be to sleep. I got on Mirtazapine after long break of ADs as my doc told me its very low-risk and she was right, at least regarding side effects (Idk about possible withdrawal) which I dont have any, except for sleepiness after I take it and increased appetite, but I welcome that as I had bad insomnia and sleep issues and Im very skinny.

So I was wondering if I just give a new med I never tried before a try or try the Mirtazapine + another med as a combo. Im really desperate and just started a new job I really like and dont want to lose, but in my condition right now I cant keep it up any longer if I dont improve mentally. I also registred for the gym and changed my diet, but Im still depressed and anxious af. Also my cognition is very bad, almost dumb, many people ask me if I have ADHD because of my bad focus and memory. 

Side info: I always wanted to test for ADHD as Methylphenidate (tried of a friend) improved my symptoms significantly but my previous docs didn‘t want to test me for ADHD (in my case rather ADD) 1. before my depression/anxiety isn‘t treated as these two can be the cause of ADHD symptoms and 2. because one needs to be diagnosed for AD(H)D in his childhood for treatment. So I just thought I‘d never be able to get test or treatment for ADD (which I really fell like having in addition to the depression and social anxiety).

Is there any antidepressant that has low risks for side effects and withdrawal that you could recommend me? Im adding the list of my tried antidepressants below so you have an overview. 

Meds to try next I was Thinking about:
Nefazodone
Clomipramine
Vortioxetine
Tranylcypromine (Parnate)
Selegiline 
Prozac (Fluoxetine - Idk surely as no serotonergic worked so far)
Lamotrigine (or any other antipsychotics, because maybe I‘m wrongly diagnosed as all these 13 meds of antidepressants I tried didn‘t work)
Wellbutrin (tried once but gave up after 1 week as I was having bad anxiety, so quit but maybe I just need more time?)


Meds I already tried:
* Cipralex (Escitalopram) + Promethazine
* Venlafaxine (Effexor) + Quetiapine (Seroquel)
* Sertraline (Zoloft)
* Opipramol
* Paroxetine (Paxil)
* Duloxetine (Cymbalta)
* Moclobemide (Aurorix)
* Amitriptyline
* Gabapentin
* Mirtazapine
* Diazepam (Valium)

I‘m trying to find a new doc at the place I now moved to (new country) so I want to give him a list of meds I‘d like to try next that could be finally potentially helping me more than my previous ones when I visit him, so very thankful for any help, suggestions or recommendations.",1,"sleepiness, increased appetite, social"
"I started to take a couple non-drug substances on a whim; I happened to have them around. One is a mineral and one is a vitamin; they're extremely common things that people might take...if you were going to take some vitamins and minerals to bolster what you're getting from your diet then these would be right at the top of the list.

In addition to these two things, I also have Concerta (a formulation of methyphenidate) in place, but I'm confident that the Concerta has been a constant and that the addition of the two other things has caused the big improvement. I don't know whether the two other things ""activate"" the Concerta; I could go off Concerta and see how much the other two things help me when Concerta isn't in play. I feel the impact of the other two things immediately when I take them; not sure what that might mean. 

Thanks to the addition of the two things, I was able to go from 45mg escitalopram to zero with zero withdrawal symptoms. I feel a lot better and my mood is a lot better. I have a lot more energy. I find this experience to be super weird. It's only by sheer accident that I even had these two non-drug substances kicking around. 

I have no idea what's wrong with my brain and why these two things that I introduced had such a profound impact. I can imagine that my response to these two things is abnormal; if it was a fact that a significant percentage of people had this kind of reaction to these two things then there would be enormous buzz about that fact, so I assume that I'm an outlier. 

I have ADHD. I find it a bit daunting to try to ascertain whether you are (as an ADHD patient) likely to benefit from one or another non-drug substance. The science doesn't seem to be super helpful in telling you what to try, though I guess that the science does give you a list of things to try. And if you don't get an immediate and powerful impact from taking the non-drug substance, how do you figure out whether it's actually helping? See here:

>A sufficient supply of micronutrients, such as minerals and vitamins, is required for normal brain development. Micronutrient deficiencies may contribute to dysfunctioning of the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of ADHD [3]. Associations between symptoms of ADHD and mineral and trace element status regarding magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, and selenium have been proposed. However, the findings of studies exploring such associations have been inconclusive [22].

>Hair trace element and mineral levels were examined in 52 boys with ADHD and 52 typically developing boys [23]. Statistically significant reductions in hair copper, magnesium, and manganese were found in children with ADHD. In regression models, hair zinc and magnesium levels were inversely associated with the severity of ADHD [23]. Serum mineral and trace element levels were measured in 68 children with ADHD and 68 typically developing children [24]. In comparison with controls, serum levels of chrome, magnesium, and zinc in children with ADHD were reduced by 21%, 4%, and 7%, respectively, while serum copper/zinc values were 11% higher [24]. The role of these changes in the pathophysiology of ADHD remains to be investigated.

>Further studies on magnesium, zinc, and iron in ADHD have been published recently.

...

>The findings of several observational studies have suggested a role of vitamin D in the pathophysiology of ADHD. The pooled data of a meta-analysis including eight observational studies (with 2655 children with a diagnosis of ADHD and 8669 healthy controls) showed statistically significant reduced 25(OH)D levels in children with ADHD compared to controls [34]. Large cohort studies are required to investigate whether vitamin D-deficient infants are more likely to develop ADHD in the future. A systematic review and meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials with 256 children, examining the effects of vitamin D supplementation as adjunctive therapy to methylphenidate on ADHD symptoms, showed a small but statistically significant improvement in ADHD total scores, hyperactivity scores, inattention scores, and behavior scores [35]. However, these effects were limited by the low to very low quality of evidence provided by the available studies. Effects of combined supplementation of vitamin D and magnesium [28] are described above.",1,ad
"i began taking zoloft (i think 100mg) in 2019 and it went on for around a year. at the time i began having dreams every night but it wasn’t bothersome at all. even after going off treatment i kept having dreams almost daily and they were all very intense.

1.5 yrs ago i began taking zoloft again (a dosage of 75mg again) and then swapped to a venlafaxine based pill (also of 75mg). you guessed it, the dreams keep persisting. 

my point is, is there any way i can prevent having dreams? before you tell me to talk to my psychiatrist, i already did and she ended up telling me to swap sertraline for venlafaxine (and it wasn’t even because of the dreams, but because of fidgeting and restlessness).",1,"dreams, dreams, dreams"
"Hello!

I recently read about a phenomenon called ""receptor regulation"" which is a mechanism that either increases or decreases the number of a receptor depending on the amount of ligands.

I am currently taking Zyban SR (bupropion) for depression, and seeing so many people talking about developing a tolerance to this drug it made me wonder whether dopaminergic antidepressants such as bupropion, nefazodone, vortioxetine, etc could lead to the down regulation of dopamine receptors and other negative effects.",1,down regulation of dopamine receptors

##First, acknowledgements:

I acknowledge that I have a really good professional taking care of me, a good psychiatrist, a good psychology, healthcare and an understanding family. I had periods of depression (more specifically dysthymia) that were lighter, but this period was hard: it came when everything in my life was ""supposed to be good"" but I wasn't met with judgement – even when I couldn't eat for days or get out of my bed, even if I needed to pee. So, antidepressants, for me, were a last resort, they felt like that. I also acknowledge that I am lucky that these drugs *worked* for me, that the tapering off was easy and there was almost zero side-effects – one of them was kinda funny, since people expect the opposite.

## Dosage:

100mg every night with food.

##Summarising the effects:

######**In one phrase:** desvenlafaxine counteracted my tiredness (caused by dysthymia), so it was impossible for me to feel lethargy (my biggest symptom), which fixed my whole routine (even when I didn't notice it!).

* **1) More energy:**

My biggest symptom was lethargy, which would get so bad I wouldn't eat for days. I didn't even have energy to poop and even my pee was holding up. Desvenlafaxine / Pristiq gave me energy right away so I was able to eat, do my physiological needs and overall *live* instead of just exit laying around.

More energy also meant that I was more erratic in the beginning – since I didn't know how to deal with it. I felt ""*ONLINE, ALERT*"".

* **2) Couldn't properly feel tired – mentally or physically.**

That's a double-edged effect. On the one hand, I could enjoy more of my day, however I wanted, because I wasn't lethargic. On the other hand, I had to be much more aware of very subtle hints that I was getting tired, like losing concentration, because I wouldn't feel it. However, the body *knows* that it is tired, so sometimes I was yawning a damn lot, yet no tiredness. I had to forcefully put myself on rest, which brings the next point.

* **3) Sleep:**

I would sleep a cycle of *exactly* four or six uninterrupted hours. 

I could also wake up to alarms (!) and it did not if the alarm broke my sleep hours. For instance, if I went to sleep at 4 a.m but needed to wake up at 6 a.m., I would wake up to the alarm and not feel tired. Sleeping more also did not mean I would get more well-rested. Later on in the section called ""*Interaction with other substances""* I'm going to explain how I exploited this so I *actually* could get real rest

I could go back to sleep if I wanted but I was well-rested most of the time (or I didn't feel the tiredness). I said I had to ""forcefully put myself on rest"". It sounds paradoxical, after all, one doesn't *force* rest. However, if I set the intention to sleep when it was time to sleep, it would come easily.

I had to adapt to this so I could get a good sleep, so most of the time I was waking up at 8 a.m because I was going to sleep after 2 a.m. Not cool talking about my ""night owl"" sleep schedule, but I was honestly better. If I had healthier habits, it would be ever better.

* **4) Routine:**

Since the medicine fixed my sleep and tiredness, I had to create a routine so it would become a mental habit independent of the medicine. I forced myself to eat 3 meals a day in fixed times, even when I wasn't particularly hungry. I also hooked that to my family routine, so I would always match with others.

* **5) Feeling hotter (temperature!):**

One of the side-effects is higher blood pressure, which *can* make one feel hotter/warmer. My blood pressure didn't change, but I felt hotter.

* **6) Dry mouth:**

The biggest offender. I couldn't do much about it. Lip balms helped little.

* **7) Upset stomach in the first days:**

The medicine is orally ingested, which means it can have an impact in your stomach. I had to discharge (poop) after 2h of taking the meds in the first week because of this. You could call that diarrhoea, but it normalised beautifully.

* **8) Couldn't climax properly / delayed ejaculation (only the first month):**

Self-explanatory. It wasn't anorgasmia but it reduced my sensibility to easily self-pleasure but it made it linger. So, it was a trade-off. I could go on hours beating my meat with no signs of eruption from my urethra. I had to *really* want to squeeze the juice out of my meat. I put this before point 9) because it's shorter and easier to separate.

* **9) Libido through the roof:**

That's funny because antidepressants generally reduce your libido.

In the first month I HAD TO masturbate. It wasn't even funny.

It was not like horniness, it was just libido. Let me try to explain with an analogy: sometimes we get hungry, sometimes we get cravings. Cravings are for specific things, like sweets or salty food; hunger is the sensation caused by lack of food, it's not specific. So my libido was like hunger – not caused and unspecific –, whilst horniness is directed – about a certain desire, and I had none, although I did use visual stimulation because I thought ""since I'm gonna do it anyway, better make it easier..."". Didn't help.

So, many times I HAD to clean the pipes. Anything could easily pitch a tent under my garments. I could be studying/writing/playing a game and, boom, I'd feel compelled to ""sexy it out"". It was kind of embarrassing because I felt this pulsating sensation but nothing could dampen it – seriously, I *tried* to dampen that by climaxing many times during the day and night, but *nothing* changed, not even exercise, meditation or sleep. I accepted that as just a fact of my body and life, stopped identifying with it and moved on. After the first month, it subsided, but I could access it easily if I wanted or was careless.

(I would honestly feel better if I had no libido since I don't care about that and do not plan on having a romantic or sex life, but this experience might be very positive for other people and I think my posting here may be positive for any third-party who feels lost on the topic of meds.)

* **10) Weird dreams (""serotonin dreams"")**

Every night I had a weird dream. The best way to describe them would be ""Alice in Wonderland"". No, they were not lisergic, they actually had a logic, but they were fantastical, in the fantasy sense.

I kept a dream journal just because I *knew* I would dream. I still had these dreams intermittently for about a month after tapering off the medication.

___
##Interaction with other substances:

Some of these things I discovered accidentally, so I'll put disclaimers. It's not advice, it's just observations so you can check their effects in your system if you need.

* **1) Caffeine**

During quarantine I got the habit of drinking a *lot* of coffee. I say about 700ml to 1 litre per day. Not a joke.

I drank coffee because of the taste, not the caffeine – this is just a side-effect. So I interleaved with decaf coffee, strong coffee, mild coffee, you name it. However, there is a very interesting thing that happened: caffeine + desvenlafaxine made me *well-rested*!

I tried this in many different ways to see if it wasn't a placebo or another substance. So, to be *absolutely sure* I was drinking a litre of freshly-brewed extra strong coffee before sleep. Then I went to sleep and woke up feeling like a Tibetan monk after years of meditation in the Himalayas. I felt *K A L M*. It was the type of calm like: almost zero thoughts; whatever I wanted to do, *I did*, like ""sit down and study"", ""clean the house"". It felt like taking Ritalin / Methylphenidate.

This only worked if I rested after gulping down the coffee – even if I took some time to actually rest/sleep. I don't know the *whys, maybe the dopamine receptors of my brain are being ""rested"" during sleep and caffeine makes me wake with them ""full-on"", or something to do with homeostasis. I've asked some doctors about that and there was no explanation, but they did notice that with ADHD patients (and online forums of people with ADHD are full of the same anecdote).

I did not do it everyday, and I tried it with decaf to know the extent. I also tried it *after* the treatment to know if it was really the desvenlafaxine or a heavy placebo. It did not work without the medication. *I also quit coffee for months, even after the treatment.* I had headaches on day 2 and 4 and zero repercussions later.

There is also another effect that I'd like to add: I could sort of extend the effects of Pristiq for *days* by having certain quantities of caffeine through coffee (haven't tried with caffeine pills). So I could ""milk"" the effect for about 4 days if I really set myself to, or 3 days normally. That is what I was doing since I felt that caffeine had a good effect on me and the medication. For example, if I take it on Sunday, I will still feel the effects on Wednesday, so I can have a normal Thursday, compensate on Friday with something else if I need (meditation, exercise, caffeine, relax a bit), relax on Saturday and redose if I want.


* **2) Ritalin / Methylphenidate**

I am autistic/asperger and have a history of ADHD in my family. I talked to the doctor about this for *months*, even after I had a good routine down with food, exercise and meditation, I still had problems with mental energy and focus. I got the prescription for Ritalin under very tight circumstances and after testing caffeine-non-caffeine for years. Then I took the pill and finally understood what *actual* focus and calm was. (Even when I meditated for 2 hours I didn't feel like that).

Under Ritalin (immediate release - IR), I get very *calm*, almost like my body has been thoroughly massaged (it is very pleasurable), which reduces my sensory sensitivities (mostly due to autism), and I get very empathetic, social and even happy/joyful (yeah, weird). It makes focusing easier, but not effortless, so I still need willpower since I can also focus on a train of thought for hours if I'm not careful, although the thoughts are more linear.

I really wanted to cry when I felt these things.

This is different from the ""caffeine calm"" because I didn't feel ""massaged"" then, nor happier, the tensions in my body did not go away, but it was OK.

I am putting this because Ritalin's effected were magnified with desvenlafaxine, as in I could feel the effects better. After I tapered off desvenlafaxine, I tried methylphenidate again and

I also wrote down *every possible thing* that happened in the 4-hour window of effect of the drug, every other dozens of minutes.

>""1 hour later, X effect, 2 hours latter = Y effect; no effect"" etc.

I took care of myself, I tried eating at different intervals from taking the pill so I would know what's best and I settled for eating 30 minutes after the pill; I also wrote down any deviation from my normal thought pattern (like thinking sadder things), so I knew it was the *comedown effect*. I did get headaches sometimes. Nothing serious.

I don't take Ritalin any more although I still have it here. I may try again in the future. I still have to investigate this further since it could be a case of atypical ADHD or an atypical effect of autism. Now, after knowing these paradoxical effects of stimulants, I know I have a dopamine problem that's not just due to ""modern life"", I can be more gentle with myself and not beat myself down, which is good for my health.

___
##Tapering off:

That's probably the most important thing after having the medication *working*. Why? Because for many, including me, depending on pills is not desirable. I saw that as a treatment, not a lifelong commitment, and worked to create habits that helped me foster my health so I wouldn't depend on drugs.

On the other hand, I do not control my biology, so if my body needed it longer, I would not have a problem because I saw the substance as a *tool*, not a part of my identity. I did not have judgement about myself, I treated this disease in a very *matter-of-fact* way. I did not moralise, nor throw guilt, nor praise. I tried my hardest to separate myself from the process so I could objectively assess my needs. (Same goes for the ""*Interaction with other substances*"" section).

######Under that same light, I want to say that we should notice our needs and respect them. Some people need medicine as a tool, so they only access them sometimes; some people need it as a crutch, they will cling to it for some time; some people need it as a lifelong commitment. Each of these scenarios is valid. Judgement is not required but adaptation is.

So, to the effects of tapering off:

They were mostly light and annoying instead of debilitating.

* **1) Slight vertigo**

Vertigo makes you feel like the room is spinning. In my case it felt like the room was ""walking"". 

* **2) Heartbeat aligned with eye movements**

This is a weird-ass effect, more annoying than hurtful or debilitating, but I found **nothing** about it on the net, **except** for one specific forum. It was like this: if I moved my eyes, my heart would either beat or skip a beat, I don't know exactly (I would need a professional and a stethoscope to know this). This made it hard to read. I could still function if I didn't focus on this side-effect. Sometimes I forced eye movements just so I could see how I endured, but this is a chemical side-effect, so it was helpless.

* **3) More emotional**

It wasn't the ""depression coming back"" type of emotional, since my depression/dysthymia basically makes me flatline, it was ""feeling touched by songs"" type of emotional. It was quite weird because I'm not like this. I was feeling both inspired and sad, melancholic and hopeful.

######**The first day I stopped taking the medication I felt nothing. The worst of withdrawal was day 4. Day 5 was easier but I decided to take the pills again because quitting cold turkey is irresponsible. Then I started taking every 2 days, then 3, then 7, then I didn't. I didn't feel withdrawals again when taking every X days.**

######**It is also important for me to say that I did the treatment in ""batches"": I took the medicine for a certain quantity of weeks (6 or more) and then I tapered off until I didn't need, then began the treatment again with medical follow-up, so I wouldn't get used to it and no side-effect would engender themselves. I've done this with support, which is the most important thing a human can have when needing help.**

"So I've been getting treatment for my depression for almost two years now, and also for my ADHD. But, courtesy of my mother nagging me with ""when are you going to stop depending on those meds"", my father saying ""you're going to get addicted/ become dependent. They just prescribe meds to earn money"", and my ADHD, I haven't been as constant as I should have. I actually hadn't been taken my medication for about a month since I came back to live with my parents for my internship year, despite having a box of each (methylphenidate and venlafaxine). Of course, I've been a mess, but my parents blame it on me being just ""distracted"" and sometimes ""lazy"".

But since I already started my internship, I began taking them again. Today. Four hours ago. And I feel fine, I just have this burning sensation in my scalp. Not a headache, I get pain a millisecond and it goes away, comes back and again leaves just as quickly, and it's not intense. But my scalp just feels really, really hot. As if direct midday sunlight was hitting it for the last hour, except I've been under a roof all day. That and I feel some palpitations. I think it may be related, but I was wondering if anyone else experienced this. If it adds more context, I'm (most likely, but still not officially diagnosed) on the autism spectrum. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Or should I call my psychiatrist?",1,##alpitations
"Hi all, I’ll give a history of the suspected symptoms and share my big concern afterward. 

I’ve had this involuntary repetitive jaw movement/clenching that has waxed and waned since around when I had a several month trial in 2019-2020 where buproprion and methylphenidate were attempted to treat MDD and potential ADHD. At this point it felt like a really strained tension in my head and jaw, specifically the jaw movement being a 3 second interval of rhythmic forward contraction with releases. I ended up discontinuing ADHD meds and bupropion followed by an introduction of Lexapro. Memory might be off some but I believe this switch lead to a lessening of jaw issues but still subtlety remained.. until trying more medications…

Well I have been taking different SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, Luvox) and SNRIs (Effexor, Cymbalta) ever since with a couple failed discontinuation attempts, the most recent gave me f’ed up akathisia until my shrink and I instated Luvox at the end of ‘22 (newly dx’d with OCD). Overall these trials seemed lead to more flares of jaw movements and pain especially as dose is increased. It’s so uncomfortable especially in the afternoon and evening! And now in the past weeks I’ve noticed my tongue flexing, swelling, and pressing against the roof of my mouth for hours on end which is honestly scaring me. After all this time shrinks chalked up the jaw problem to bruxism or even “perhaps I’m doing it on my own,” according to the recent guy. I hadn’t mentioned the tongue thing since it’s very new.

Okay so now I’m badly perplexed and concerned as I’m in between finding a new psychiatrist, the suspected TD symptoms are continuing & developing, and I’m stuck on Luvox as it’s buffering me against depression+severe anxiety+OCD - a seriously messed up catch-22 if the medication is exacerbating and progressing a to permanent TD (unless it’s already there)! Ugh, I don’t know what to do in the meantime while waiting for professional help.

Oh also I’ve never taken antipsychotics. Any ideas on what may be going on and what I can do?",1,"repetitive jaw movement, clenching, ##s of jaw movements, flexing"
"Effexor surely helped me from my suicidal idea, anxiety, and some very low episodes. I was so thankful of how much it changed my state of current distress to a point that I cried in the bus because I felt so thankful after just a few weeks of taking it. However, I'm now on my 10th month of taking 150mg and I'm starting to feel this sort of tension and frustration whenever I realize how disconnected I feel to myself. I care and love myself, I KNOW that but I can't FEEL it. I probably felt this way as well before taking the medication, but there used to be a time I felt whole. I felt content and grateful for simply existing and yet I can't reach those feelings anymore. Those feelings made me feel alive. 

I'm wondering whether taking the medication is preventing me from experiencing such emotions again. Whenever I try to ground myself and focus on feeling love for myself, I end up in an empty vicinity. Like I've reached a block. No feelings or thoughts come up. 

Have you guys experienced something similar?",1,

For the past few days I've been taking it at night instead of in the morning and it seems to be making a difference. I have been sleeping upwards of 16+ hours a day. I've found in the past I tend to react differently with stimulants. Caffeine doesn't work on me. That's why I take methylphenidate extended release so it's spread out throughout the day.

Last August I got covid and was really sick, my vitamin D dropped very low but we have since corrected that problem and I still sleep like the dead.

 And then i went into a rather crowded, small, low ventilation classroom to take a practice test and was hit with cold sweat, dizziness and intense nausea some time in, enough to make me decide i would be unable to complete the test and i should find somewhere to puke.

 I have since nearly fully recovered after about 10 minutes walking outside with some mild lingering stomach discomfort.

However it didn't make the withdrawals go away completely, and they're worse today even though I took one today for work.

"Hi, I‘m a 19 y/o trans woman, 6 months on HRT (10 mg Cyproterone Acetate and 3 mg Estrogel daily) and I‘m 170cm (5ft7) tall and weigh around 55kg (122lbs). I‘m diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder, ADHD combined type, ASD and gender dysphoria.

My ADHD diagnosis is fairly new (got it in the beginning of September, so last month), however I‘ve been in therapy for depression for much longer (since June 2020). I tried Sertraline and Vortioxetine in the past but they both didn‘t do anything. As a result of that I had genetic testing done which showed I was an ultra-rapid metabolizer through CYP2C19 which apparently more or less excludes me from treatment with many antidepressants, including (Es-)citalopram. Anyway, I was unmedicated for a while and saw a new psychiatrist on September 22nd. We discussed some options and at the end I was prescribed 30mg Duloxetine (Cymbalta) (was told to increase it to 60 after 2 weeks) and 18mg Methylphenidate (generic Methylphenidate XR tablets) for my depression and ADHD. I actually asked the doc if it was safe as they are both Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors but he said as long as you keep an eye on it, it‘s fine. 

However, I actually went to a psych ward the following week where I‘m in stationary treatment now. They took me off of Methylphenidate as they wanted to know which med my side effects (being anxious, agitated and dizzy) came from. They told me they planned to put me back on my ADHD meds after a while though as I told them that treating my ADHD is important for me. The side effects went away and they increased my Duloxetine dose to 60mg on September 30th. Last Friday however they came back to me and told me they had „read into it some more“ and combining Duloxetine and Methylphenidate was apparently dangerous after all so I had to drop Duloxetine to restart ADHD treatment and apologized for „not knowing earlier“. Weird thing is, they suggested Wellbutrin as an alternative which the psychiatrist before the clinic excluded as an option because of the high interaction potential. Regardless, they immediately ended my prescription for Duloxetine and I‘m supposed to start Concerta tomorrow which I‘m happy about but still, I‘d like to have sth against my depression too maybe and it just seems really strange that opinions vary this much. So I wanted to ask here. Is it really dangerous to combine these two meds? And how would Wellbutrin be any safer than Cymbalta? I mean it also increases the availability of Noradrenaline (like Cymbalta) AND Dopamine on top (unlike Cymbalta). Wouldn‘t that interfere with Methylphenidate even more? 

I haven‘t really been able to talk about this with the doc as he is on vacation rn. Anyway, sorry for being rambly, I hope I‘m making sense, I‘m just a bit frustrated with whom to trust and whom not.

Hello everyone, 

I'm not really sure where to ask this question but this place seems like it may be able to provide some sort of guidance. I would be seeing a psychiatrist if I had the means, but unfortunately I don't at the moment. I have tried both amphetamine and methylphenidate based stimulants, but I have only received this effect from methylphenidate. I would be speaking with my physician about this.. But honestly I don't think they are too knowledgeable about the differences between the drugs. I say this not to be rude, but they literally said both of the drugs are basically identical and one may work for me while the other may not. This seems to be accurate, but when I inquired further information, or even asked about basic differences they just told me they forgot. 

Essentially Concerta 18mg (methylphenidate) was the first medication I was put on for the treatment of my ADHD. This drug was able to turn my mind off - as in it stopped the self talk in my head and I could actually focus. For some reason Vyvanse (amphetamine) does not have this effect. I currently can't afford Concerta, but I can Vyvanse since it's covered by insurance. I have researched into the drug interactions with which could be interfering with the effects of Vyvanse, and for a while now I have reduced or stopped inducing such substances.

Is this just a YMMV sort of thing, or was it because it was my first time inducing a stimulant, or some other reason? Could the dosage of my current medication be too low (I started with 20mg of Vyvanse and I'm up to 40mg now)? 

Does anybody know the reason for this?",1,

This was far more harmful than helpful, so I decided to start treating myself. I felt 'normal' whenever I'd ocassionally taken methylphenidate to study prior to that, so settled on using it every day to help with my depression.

I am afraid my dopamine system has been irreversibly changed. I recently had a 16-day break from Methylphenidate because of a holiday.

Three days ago, around 6 PM, I had just gotten out of the shower and went downstairs to say hi to my partner when I suddenly got a very strong ""weird"" feeling hit me like a wave. One second everything was fine, and the next second I felt extremely lightheaded, dizzy, and disoriented. I immediately told my partner that I felt like something was wrong. My left arm (in the bicep area) began tightening and cramping/burning. My whole left side of my body felt like it was some mixture of tingly and numb. My stomach also felt like it was being flipped upside down, and I initially mistook the dizziness and stomach feeling for flushness and nausea, thinking I was about to suddenly throw up (which has been happening to me periodically for a few weeks without explanation). However, I noticed that I didn't have any increased salivation which is usually the way I know that I need to vomit near immediately. That was when it clicked for me that it wasn't normal sickness. I couldn't really form precise thoughts well, and I felt like I was detached from my body. However, I could still generally communicate (which mostly consisted of a lot of anxious noises and ""I really don't feel good."" or ""Something doesn't feel right.""). I was able to slowly walk a few feet to grab my water bottle with my right hand (since it wasn't affected) and then take a drink from it, hoping it would help calm my body down. I sat on the bed in silence for about a minute, trying to take deep breaths, before the feelings faded. I was initially terrified that I had a stroke or TIA. After the feelings faded, my left arm still felt quite sore (which lasted about an hour), and I was suddenly *dead* exhausted followed with an extremely mild headache. I had at least some energy left for the evening prior to the event, but it felt like it was drained from me immediately after. All I wanted to do was sleep right after it happened, but I was too frazzled by the event to do so. The only other thing that has concerned me since then is that the extremely mild headache I had still feels like it's there and hasn't gone away. That may just be my anxiety getting to me, though.

My mother was diagnosed with epilepsy about a year ago, but she isn't in any part of my life, so I don't know the exact details of her diagnosis. Not to mention, I've presumed that her epilepsy was caused by her alcohol/tobacco/drug abuse over her lifetime.

Only prior info I can give that might help is that I hadn't eaten really anything that day nor drank any water (which is partly due to my Concerta), but I had eaten and drank water about an hour prior to the event. Likely unrelated, but I've also been having auditory processing issues recently for the past few weeks. 

I've messaged my doctor about it and I'm waiting to hear back. Any info or help understanding what happened and what to do going forwards is greatly appreciated",1,

"I’m 18 and female and 120lbs. I’ve been feeling manic for two days. I recently had my gallbladder removed about a week ago. I take 27mg of methylphenidate and 20 mg of escitalopram for adhd and anxiety respectively. I’ve been feeling more anxious the past couple months and having trouble with sleeping. Over the weekend I was going out to parties and drinking heavily with my friends however before I went out each night I had had around 1200 mg of ibuprofen during the day (600mg once every six hours) for my post surgery pain. I did not know that alcohol and pain killers were dangerous to take together. I also am taking stool softeners occasionally. I was also given hydrocodone I think 10-20mg to have only at night time however I only used it once and at least a day and a half before I started drinking. After the second night of that routine I woke up and took my methylphenidate. The past few days I’ve had all the symptoms of Hypomania. Feeling restless, having lots of energy, loss of appetite, talking uncontrollably and fast, blurting out things I don’t mean to tell people, and having ‘epitomes’ that keep me up all night googling hundreds of questions. I keep doing stupid things and telling people stuff that is embarrassing and personal and puts them in uncomfortable situations. My friends have definitely noticed and they are apprehensive of me because I keep bringing up taboo topics or traumatic things from my past that no one should hear about in a day to day conversation. It’s like words just fall out of my mouth in barely coherent sentences and my mind is racing a mile a minute. I crashed earlier and broke down, I started googling my symptoms and everything seems to line up with a hypomanic episode. I’ve never been bipolar. Day to day my mood is generally stable. Can some mix of escitalopram, methylphenidate, ibuprofen, stool softeners, and alcohol induce a hypomanic episode on a non-bipolar person?",1,
"21F taking hydroxyzine, methylphenidate, vilazodone & sertraline daily. 

Basically, the title. My big toe on my left foot has felt like it has saran wrap over it for a year. It's not fully numb, but the sense is definitely different than my right foot for example. The saran wrap feeling kinda extends halfway up my calf, but it's not as pronounced as with my toe. It also gets worse when I stand for long periods of time, which I do for my job.

Additionally, I've also had severe back pain that in the past has kept me from being able to get out of bed. It used to occur every time I laid down, but I've mostly fixed it with a posture change while laying down. However it does sometimes ""flare up"". While I was moving back into the dorms in August I must have done something but it hurt to move my back and legs at all. Sitting hurt, but so did standing and laying down. The pain was honestly a 9. At some point I remember I moved wrong and thought I was going to collapse. 

I feel I should also mention that I occasionally get this weird pain in the back of my neck on the left side that stretches up into the back of my ear, mostly while driving. I'm assuming it's because I'm frequently checking around corners and such and thus turning my neck more than usual. 

I've told my doctor about all of this minus the neck pain. She gave me stretches to do for the back pain and it sorta helped I guess? When I told her about my toe, she said I have poor circulation due to not exercising as much as I should.

I've had several people comment that I'm way too young to be having the back pain that I do. The back pain has been a thing for years, but it wasn't always as severe as it gets now. The neck pain is also newer, probably started around the same time my toe became numb. Coincidentally, I also got hired for my job in which I'm standing for long periods of time about a year ago. 

Given the area of affect and timing, it sounds similar to a pinched nerve or something to me, but I'm not a doctor of course. Any opinions? ",1,
"So, I'm 21F, aprox 5'1, 134 lbs and i live in Spain. The only medication i take is methylphenidate (40 mg) but i didn't take it yesterday. And i only drink on social gatherings and smoke ocasionally but yesterday i didnt do any of those two things either.

I've been having a period since i was like 8 or 10 without any major complications. In a scale of 0 to 10 my pain is usually a 1-2. However my period just started yesterday (nov 5th 1 am maybe a bit earlier) and i did have some pain during the day but the normal amount, at 1pm i went to donate blood (since they always check for hemoglobin i know that if i already lost too much they just wont let me so they did allow me to donate bcs it was at normal levels). After the donation and having some juice i stayed there for a lil bit before they took of that claw that they use to hold the pressure and i went to the bathroom. While there i started to get really dizzy, i started to feel really hot out of nowhere and i noticed that i might faint or smth so i got out and washed my face with cold water before going back to the nurses and telling them i wasnt feeling great and that i was feeling kinda dizzy.

They helped me lay down and started fanning me and making me smell an alcohol wipe, which helped, the thing is that the next thing i knew is that i started to have horrible period pains, literally worst pain i've ever felt in a scale from 0 to 10 it was easily a 9 or 10. Soon after the pain started my hands started to feel very numb and i was unable to move them so 4 of them stayed together and straight, kinda bending down, together and the thumb below but also straight, and after a few min of constant pain i also started to feel a pressure on my neck (kinda at the sides in the general zone of the thyroid). After a while it started to get really hard to keep my eyes open, I was still conscious and could respond to questions but only when i wasnt in pain, so it was like 5s without pain after a few min of constant pain that felt as if my uterus wanted to get out of my body. Apparenlty i was really pale, dilated pupils, and my hands were freezing, i mean u didnt even have to touch them you could just see them with the tips kinda purplish. The nurses didnt have any meds to give me other than paracetamol tablets but i couldnt swallow, so they put an iv to make sure i was hydrated but thats it.

After about 30-40 min the ambulance came and they took me to the hospital but by the time i got there the pain lowered significantly. and they didnt give me any more meds.  
Both my blood pressure and glucose levels, were fine, i did have a bit of a higer heart rate but thats expected.  
Now I'm really scared that it'll happen again and idk if theres something i can do to avoid that and how urgent is it to get an appointment with my doctor or if its even worth getting an appointment.

Hi!

First of all, sorry for a wall of text but I do really believe the nuance is important in this case. I'd appreciate it if you could give me a few valuable minutes of your time to this post. Thank you very much!

I am looking for help with my issue - I am severely unmotivated to do absolutely anything.

**No strength to do anything:**

Absolutely zero energy to do anything physical that isn't more than just living. Any hobbies and interests I have are digital (coding, 3D art, VFX, video editing) because then I don't have to do anything physical to enjoy them. Even then, sometimes I would like to play a game but it feels like it'd be too much work to open the game and wait for everything to load, so I don't end up playing it.

I feel like the biggest quirk of this issue is that it's not only that I find it hard to do things that I don't want to do. I actually **don't feel the energy to do the things that I actually want to do**.

Nothing ever helps.

**I am very messy:**

I always build up a massive mess around me. Not because I like it, but because tidying it up would cost me too much energy compared to how much satisfaction I would get from cleaning it up. There is a point at which I just decide it's too much and tidy up the room, but that point can manifest in 2 or even 3 months.

**Odd behavior due to low energy:**

* A year ago I bought electronic components to build some circuits. I haven't done it much though because **it is too much work to move 40cm (15 inches) to the right** from my PC. It's on the same desk as my PC station, all I would have to do to use it is to move the chair to the right.
* I wanted to cook my own food, but slicing veggies is too much work so I stopped doing that and go for packaged, ready meals.
* I engineered my entire life to move as little as possible. I decided to work 100% remotely. I order all of my groceries and occasionally fast-food. I bought my gym equipment for it to be in the same room as my bed and my PC, etc.
* I don't bring mustard / ketchup bottles back to the fridge after I finish a meal. It feels like too much work. But I also don't want to eat something that hasn't been in the fridge for a day, so whenever I have my next meal that requires mustard / ketchup I just bring another, fresh one. This way all mustards, ketchups, etc. become single use for me.

**No control:**

All of the above is **chronic**. There are absolutely some spurts of wanting to do things, but it's never something I choose, it's always something I want. It feels like I am in the hands of a puppeteer who is deciding what I am going to do and I have no say in it, because I am not strong enough to fight the pull of the strings.

**I gotta do what I gotta do:**

I know that, as adults, we're supposed to push through mundane things we don't want to do. I do that for work and I do that for losing weight right now. But that's because I need money and I don't want to die too early. I cover all the basic needs for myself. I just don't want to feel like a corpse and sit on my butt every day because nothing is driving me to do anything else than those basic things.

This issue is not related to the current weight loss journey or weight either, because I've been dealing with the same intensity of those issues since I was around 25 years old. This was the case even when I wasn't obese (I was 68kg/149 lbs) between 2017 and 2020.

**Bizarre stimulant resistance:**

* Methylphenidate 30mg CR and 10mg IR helps me with attention, but has **NO effect** on my energy levels.
* Caffeine doesn't work either, I can drink 4 energy drinks and fall asleep like a baby right after.
* I tried piracetam, even though the science for its effects isn't really clear cut, but also zero results.
* I had low vit D levels so I am using Calfos to shoot them up significantly, and am at the normal level by now. No change in energy levels though.

It's infuriating, because it isn't even getting worse. My low energy seems fixed like a cosmological constant. It just doesn't budge either one way or the other.

**Could you please help me ""diagnose"" this? How should I approach this?**",1,
"I am a student in my 20:s reaching out in the hope that someone may have suggestions or ideas that can help me in any way with my insomnia..

Since childhood, I have struggled with sleep problems. In my early years, this manifested as difficulty falling asleep, often taking 1-2 hours, along with short sleep duration. For many years, I believed this was normal, but my condition has worsened over time. In the last two years, I have developed severe chronic insomnia, during which I manage only 0-3 hours of sleep per night. Regardless of sleep aids, I consistently wake up between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. I never experience natural sleepiness; every night, it feels as though my eyes are wide open and I am painfully alert, despite being severely sleep-deprived.

I have tried most available sleep aids, but they have been largely ineffective and often come with undesirable side effects.

Unfortunately, the healthcare system in my country offers limited support for cases like mine. Doctors here can only provide general recommendations, and it is not possible to consult specialists in sleep disorders or specific diagnoses. Healthcare is regionally provided and government-funded, for which I am very grateful, but it also means I have limited access to more specialized expertise.

In addition to my sleep issues, I am diagnosed with ADHD and currently take dextroamphetamine to manage it. I was previously prescribed methylphenidate, but it caused significant side effects related to elevated norepinephrine levels, and at lower doses, it was ineffective in treating inattentiveness. I later switched to Vyvanse, which effectively managed my ADHD, but the 30 mg dose only lasted about three hours before I experienced a comedown. As a result, I now take 7.5 mg of immediate-release dextroamphetamine 3-4 times a day, providing coverage from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, as the effects last only about two and a half hours. Unfortunately, I experience a severe crash every evening, but lower doses are ineffective, which creates a challenge.

While I acknowledge that my ADHD medication likely impacts my sleep, even when I am unmedicated, I cannot sleep more than six hours, even with the aid of zopiclone.

The core issue is that I need medication to manage my ADHD, as I am pursuing a degree that is generally regarded as difficult. With medication, I find my studies enjoyable and fulfilling, but without it, I struggle with even basic daily executive functions.

I case it is of any importance I take 1.25 mg of finasteride every other day for hair loss.

I have eliminated caffeine, maintain good sleep hygiene, and use a weighted blanket. I have also tried numerous sleep aids, as listed below:

# Sleep Aids and Their Results:

1. [**Melatonin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin) **(1-10 mg)**
   * **Receptors**: MT1 and MT2 receptors
   * Helped slightly with sleep onset but did not prevent middle-of-the-night awakenings.
2. [**Promethazine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promethazine)
   * **Receptors**: H1 receptor (antagonist), M1 receptor (anticholinergic)
   * No improvement in sleep. Caused leg jerks and confusion at higher doses.
3. [**Propiomazine (Propavan)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propiomazine) (6.25-25 mg)
   * **Receptors**: H1 receptor (antagonist), D2 receptor (antagonist), 5-HT2A receptor (antagonist)
   * Even at low doses, I experienced severe cognitive impairment the following day. Occasionally, it provided 2-3 additional hours of sleep.
4. [**Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenhydramine) (20-75 mg)
   * **Receptors**: H1 receptor (antagonist), M1 receptor (anticholinergic)
   * Did not help with sleep at all.
5. [**Quetiapine (Seroquel)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetiapine) (6.25-25 mg)
   * **Receptors**: H1 receptor (antagonist), 5-HT2A receptor (antagonist), D2 receptor (antagonist), α1 receptor (antagonist)
   * Gave me 2-3 additional hours of sleep but caused cognitive and memory problems, and made my ADHD medication ineffective.
6. [**Mirtazapine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtazapine) (1.875-15 mg)
   * **Receptors**: 5-HT2A/2C, 5-HT3 receptor (antagonist), H1 receptor (antagonist), α2 receptor (antagonist)
   * Provided 3 more hours of sleep but caused cognitive, memory issues, and weight gain, rendering ADHD medication ineffective.
7. [**Agomelatine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agomelatine) (25-50 mg)
   * **Receptors**: MT1 and MT2 receptor agonist, 5-HT2C receptor antagonist
   * Slight improvement in sleep onset but no effect on sleep maintenance.
8. [**Alimemazine/Trimeprazine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alimemazine) (10-20 mg)
   * **Receptors**: H1 receptor (antagonist), D2 receptor (antagonist)
   * Provided 2-3 more hours of sleep but caused cognitive and memory problems, making ADHD medication ineffective.
9. [**Zolpidem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zolpidem) (5-10 mg)
   * **Receptors**: GABA-A receptor modulator (selective for α1 subunits)
   * Did not help with sleep onset or maintenance.
10. [**Zopiclone**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zopiclone) (7.5 mg)

* **Receptors**: GABA-A receptor modulator (non-benzodiazepine)
* Works 70-80% of the time, providing 6 hours of sleep, but I wake up feeling unrested. While it's the most effective medication so far, long-term use is not viable due to potential tolerance buildup. I also experience memory and concentration issues until midday the next day, though I can still attend classes.

1. [**Trazodone**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trazodone) (12.5-75 mg)

* **Receptors**: 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, H1 receptor antagonist, α1 receptor antagonist
* In 70% of cases, it provides 5-6 hours of restful sleep. However, at the minimal effective dose, I suffer from cognitive and memory problems the entire next day, preventing me from attending class or functioning normally.

1. [**Daridorexant (Quiviviq)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daridorexant) (25-50 mg)

* **Receptors**: Orexin receptor antagonist (OXR1 and OXR2)
* Provides 6 hours of shallow sleep when combined with 50 mg of agomelatine and 12.5  mg of propiomazine. On its own, it has minimal impact. However if paired with propiomazine I experience cognitive and memory  impairment until 13:00 the next day.

1. [**Amitriptyline**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitriptyline) (2.5-10 mg)

* **Receptors**: 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, H1 receptor antagonist, α1 receptor antagonist, and more
* No significant improvement in sleep and causes cognitive and memory issues the next day.

1. [**Guanfacine IR**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanfacine) (1.5 mg at bedtime)

* **Receptors**: α2A adrenergic receptor agonist
* Did not help, though I only tried it for two nights

The only medication that consistently prevents middle-of-the-night awakenings is zopiclone.

In summary, I have tried nearly every available medication for insomnia in my country. The only remaining options are clonidine and doxepin, but given their similarities to medications I’ve already tried (guanfacine and trazodone/amitriptyline), I am uncertain whether they will offer any improvement.

Hopefully there is a medicine combination that treats my ADHD and provides sufficient sleep without causing cognitive, memory issues the following day.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions, as I feel I have exhausted all known alternatives.

# TL;DR:

I've had sleep issues since childhood, which have worsened into severe chronic insomnia over the past two years, leaving me with 0-3 hours of sleep per night. I consistently wake up around 2-3 AM, and despite trying numerous sleep aids, none have provided lasting relief without significant side effects.

I also take dextroamphetamine for ADHD, which may slightly impact my sleep, but even unmedicated, I struggle to sleep more than 4 hours. I've tried almost all available insomnia medications in my country, but nothing has fully resolved the issue. I need to remain medicated for ADHD as I’m pursuing a demanding university degree, and going without medication severely affects my daily functioning. Despite maintaining good sleep hygiene and trying various treatments, I haven't found a long-term solution.

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",1,"elevated norepinephrine, leg jerks, confusion, severe cognitive impairment, cognitive and memory problems, cognitive, memory issues, weight gain, cognitive and memory problems, cognitive and memory problems, cognitive and memory impairment, cognitive and memory issues, cognitive, memory issues"

**Details:**

Bit of an odd one here...

I've noticed over the past week I've suddenly had the following:

* Visual Snow / Graininess / Static
* Flashes of light
* Afterimages / negatives when looking at things
* Frequent urination (15-20 times per day)
* Deja vu
* VERY strange and vivid dreams

It started 1 week ago:  I had some trouble breathing and thought I had a cold. I felt extremely sad and tired and had difficulty breathing. It was like I couldn't get enough oxygen in. Just sitting down it took a lot of mental and physical effort to breathe. Went to the GP who said I had no signs of infection and told me to just rest and wait for it to improve.

  
Thankfully, the breathing issue has ceased and I'm breathing fine now. However, since then, my vision has become extremely grainy. The static is constantly present and pulses very quickly. As well as this, any objects I focus on leave a very noticeable afterimage/ negative when I look away. Its highly distracting when I'm trying to work or read anything. Note: this isn't just on dark objects, it is present across my entire visual field.  In addition, I have noticed occasional flashes of light that occur a couple times a day. 

Combined with this, I am urinating extremely frequently all of a sudden and passing large volumes of urine each time. I'm going to pee around 15-20 times a day whereas before I was going maybe 6-7. Colour is normal. 

More concerningly however, is the fact I am experiencing Deja vu very frequently as well. I am having it around 2-3 times every day. I have not experienced any head injuries. Along with this, my dreams are increasingly vivid, strange and nighmare-ish. Mentally I am doing very well. No anxiety, worries or depression currently. 

I went to the GP this morning who asked for a urine sample, which produced a negative result for Diabetes.

He has told me he has no idea what's happening or why and that I should just keep an eye on my health and come back if anything changes but he says it should go away quickly. As I'm sure you can tell, I'm quite concerned about this very unique and odd combination of symptoms simultaneously.

According to what I found via Google, though my D3 levels appear normal, my D2 levels are very low which will likely require supplementation therapy for a few months, is that correct?

I'm getting desperate. For the past three years, I've been having constant diarrhea, and lately, I've been feeling bloated all day with a sensation of fullness and nausea. An endoscopy diagnosed me with esophageal sphincter incompetence. I also experience extreme fatigue during the day, headaches, and insomnia.   
  
But what worries me the most is that since early 2024, I've noticed a sudden change in my memory and concentration. I started forgetting things that had just happened, losing track of what I was doing, and couldn't focus on what people were saying. I also began to forget things I always knew, and I've noticed a kind of dyslexia that I never had before. For this, I was prescribed methylphenidate a week ago, but I haven't felt any changes. Lastly, I'm also experiencing tinnitus and several vision problems, such as worsening photophobia, floaters, and flashes, as well as a lump on the upper left side of my neck, which they said was adenopathy but that I shouldn't worry about because it's normal.

I've had blood and urine tests, all of which came back normal, as well as thyroid tests.

I feel like everything is wrong with me, and I'm getting really depressed.

Probably relevant: I am not and have never been sexually active. I know pelvic pain can be caused by stds, but it can't be that. (How I wish it could be as simple as that).
 
TL;DR: I had a period for the first time in 9 months and it has caused debilitating back pain, along with acne, brain fog, fatigue, cramps, insomnia, and mood problems. It has been near constant for 4 months and all symptoms are gradually getting worse. It is not endometriosis.
 
#Background: 
 
So this really started in January 2023. I woke up one morning with debilitating back pain. No over the counter medications would even touch it. Within a few days my period started. It was my first or second period after almost a year of continuous birth control. After a few days, I also started getting pain radiating down my leg along my sciatic nerve.
 
I saw my PCP who did an x ray and found no issues. A blood test showed no issues too. He gave me Meloxicam 10 mg and I took it as needed. I saw my obgyn because I thought it might be endometriosis. The pain had lasted for days after my period and she told me that she did not suspect endo because of that. She suggested an IUD, and I got it put in that day.
 
I don't know what helped exactly, but the pain kinda gradually reduced. After a week long trip in March where I walked a lot more than usual, the pain came back but not as severe, and it was a lot more in my leg than my back. I went to physical therapy as my PCP had suggested. It seemed to help.
 
The IUD caused a lot of bad side effects, but I gave it 6 months before going back. By the time I went back, I was having debilitating cramps and/or a period 3 weeks out of every month. She put me on norethindrone 5 mg. Within a week, my symptoms were fully resolved. The sciatica came and went, but it was the only thing that lingered. Everything else was completely gone for 9 months, I didn't even have a period at all, and my quality of life was better than it has ever been.
 
#Current situation: 
 
4 months ago, I started having period cramps. The first time I was at work and hadn't eaten anything, so I figured it was that. Later that week, I was roller skating and the cramps were back. I freaked out a little bit because I hadn't had a period in 9 months and I shouldn't be having one since nothing changed in my medication. I did have bleeding when I got home. It was light and lasted only a day or two, but the cramps were as bad as they've always been (level 5 or 6 pain), and the back pain came back in full force. I called my PCP to renew my Meloxicam prescription and got in with my obgyn very quickly. She said the only option left was to do a diagnostic laparoscopy for endometriosis.
 
I had the surgery about a month and a half later. There was no Endo. The back pain had been increasing the whole time and continued to get worse after. I also experienced other symptoms that are the same things I experience when I'm having a period: Acne, brain fog, fatigue, cramps, insomnia, and mood problems. These would be manageable if they happened a week out of every month, but that has not been the case since I started menstruating at 12.
 
At my post op appointment, the surgeon suggested I get the IUD out. By that point I had worse acne than I ever had, even in high school. He said that sometimes people get an IUD, can't tell if it really changed anything, but it eventually causes issues, so I agreed to get it out. He said to come back in a month if it didn't help. He took over prescribing Meloxicam at 15 mg.
 
The acne started to clear up overnight, the back pain was gone on day 3 and I was in a better mood. On day 4, I started having a full period. Bleeding was not light. All symptoms returned, including back pain and acne. I had bleeding for 5 or 6 days. The bleeding ended, but none of the other symptoms ended. I have not had bleeding in the 2 months since then.
 
At the 1 month appointment, he said he was out of ideas and referred me to a pelvic pain specialist. I got lucky and was able to get an appointment the next week. The same day as the specialist appointment I had a dermatologist appointment.
 
The dermatologist agreed with me that the acne is hormonal. She prescribed some creams, one of them is hormonal based, but I can't remember the names. I can edit those in later when I am back at my house.
 
The specialist heard me out, and then told me that it sounds like I'm getting the acne dealt with, and told me to bring the increasingly worse mood problems up with my psychiatrist (I told her about a routine appointment I have upcoming), and then asked me if I wanted to do anything else, since I'm getting those issues dealt with. 
 
I felt very dismissed, given that the main thing that is causing issues is the back pain, and it feels like if my hormones were working properly then I wouldn't have to go to a dermatologist or bring up the new mood issues with my psychiatrist. Basically, it felt like she was unconcerned about the underlying issue as long as I could treat the symptoms. Not to mention that I had taken off work last minute to see an out of network specialist, but she did not know that context.
 
I told her that yes, I did want to do something else, and she put me on Enskyce to be taken continuously. She told me to come back in 2-3 months.
 
That was about a month ago. So far it has not helped. Everything continues to get worse at about the same pace it's been getting worse since the start. 
 
3 weeks ago I went to urgent care because I was twitching. They told me it was tics. They did a blood test and told me that the results were promising, but still referred me to a neurologist. I called my psych because they suggested it could be from the methylphenidate (which I have taken for years with no issues like this) and the psych said it is most likely stress or anxiety. The tics technically started the day after I got my IUD out, but I didn't realize they were anything to be worried about until they got out of control one day.
 
Earlier this week I had a severe anxiety episode that was triggered by nothing and lasted for 9 hours. It wasn't quite a panic attack but it was close. I ended up calling the specialist to leave a message about how it's not working. A lady called the next day to get more information and said she would pass it to the doctor.
 
My psych appointment is not for another few weeks. I have a specialist appointment in a month and a half, but the lady I talked to said she suspected it would get moved up given my new update. The neurologist appointment is in mid to late October. I have another appointment with the dermatologist coming up too.
 
I guess my specific question is: What could be causing all of this? Could it all be from PMDD? Will I ever get better?",1,"a, sciatica, period cramps, acne, brain fog, cramps, ##omnia, ##ud, anxiety"

Suddenly I always have to wear slippers and sleep with my socks on because the friction between either me walking with socks on the floor, or my feet rubbing against cloth is extremely uncomfortable. I compare the feeling to nails scratching against those school black/green boards.   I also feel the sensitivity in my hands, but way less severe. I'm also a waitress, when I get home after work, I feel what I can only explain as an electric shock in my right foot when I walk.

Just a little additional information, I got a blood test because I thought I was experiencing peripheral neuropathy and I know that's highly associated with diabetes. Also checked to see if I was lacking vitamin B12 but everything is stable.
The only abnormal thing from my blood test is that I was hypoglycemic with my glucose at 2.8.
I've been taking Methylphenid (Biphentin) which is an ADHD drug for 6 years now and never had any problems with it.
And I've been taking isotretinoin for acne for about 4-5 months now.

Basically, I'm just wondering why this is happening or what it could be. Also wondering if it could just be nothing.",1,"electric shock, neuro"

I have been having shin splints off and on in my left shin for about six months from playing volleyball, but it’s been really bad the past two months. i have been playing almost every day for the past two months with few days off, and recently got so bad that i couldn’t walk comfortably. I did take two weeks off recently and they did go away, but came back after two days of playing again. Before the two week break the pain was on the inside of my left shin, and after coming back the pain is on the outside. unfortunately with high school season starting, i can’t just stop playing, so is there any way to get rid of them or minimize pain? The pain is really affecting my playing, making it painful to block and hit. I take 600-800 mg of ibuprofen an hour before playing, but it isn’t really helping with pain anymore. I also play with kt tape and a compression sleeve, which does help a little.

           In 2022 I got off my 30mg adderall IR because of the shortege issue at the time, after a year and a half I tried Strattera for 6 months (didn't work at all for me), but 3 months ago I got back on Adderall (this time 30mg XR) and it's maybe half as effective as it was before the break, before it worked perfectly and did the job but now I'll get like 3 hours of small Adhd relief but that's it, I don't feel the second dose at all. I don't even feel the negative side effects anymore either, before the only issue I had was it killed my appetite but now there is no effect on it at all (not that I don't like it not effecting my appetite but it should be). Went to my doctor yesterday and got switched to 54mg of methylphenidate so we will see how that goes, but I'm curious as to why a stimulant would stop working after 2 years of not taking it",1,"adhd, ##hd, appetite"
"31F, 5'3"" and 100lbs. Diagnosed with ADHD and have been on some variant of methylphenidate for 10 years (Ritalin, Rubifen, Concerta - jumped around a bit between them). End of 2021, there were some issues with renewing my chem number meaning I couldn't get my meds for roughly a month so went cold turkey. Now, I definitely noticed a lot of weird side effects with this and was very much all over the place while my body tried to find homeostasis again. The weirdest thing was that my sleep cycle completely flipped. And not gradually, but almost overnight as soon as I resumed my medication again. My entire life I've had chronic sleep-onset insomnia (shifts in cycles, I'll have months when I'm fine and months where I don't sleep more than an hour each night, started when I was an infant and is hereditary with my grandma also having it) and have always been a night person. But all of a sudden, I'm now a morning person. I thought it would settle itself but 2 years later and I'm shifting into another cycle of insomnia that I didn't immediately recognise because it's reversed. Instead of not falling asleep till 5, I'm waking up at 2 or 3 am and being unable to fall asleep again (although I don't let myself get out of bed until the ""socially acceptable"" 5am). 

My question is why? This feels very drastic and it's not the first time I'd been unable to get my meds for a period of time - nothing was different! But yet the reaction to it was extreme and has flipped a schedule I've had my entire life on its head. When I told my GP, she gave me a very confused look - I hadn't originally brought it up because I thought it was within the realm of possible side effects. Now I think different and as I've been waking up earlier and earlier, I'm worried my body is winding itself back to normal and I'll end up nocturnal for a period of time (I know, over exaggerated, but anxiety makes you think some silly things). Is this normal?

I don't have a preexisting condition about blood sugar. My dad has a glucometer for his diabetes. After my ADHD medication (methylphenidate), I usually have a couple hour window of withdrawal, where I feel shaky, irritable, and slightly brain-fogged. None of them are serious though. This is something that has been going on since I started, which my doctor knows. 

But today, just out of curiosity, I decided to measure my blood sugar during my withdrawal, since the symptoms are quite similar to that of hypoglycemia. It was 44mg/dL (2.4 mmol/L). I thought that there could be a mistake in the device, so I measured again, and it was 39. I immediately drank about 10 ounces of a drink which had around 25g of sugar in it in total. 15 minutes passed, I measured it again, to see that it rose up to 111mg/dL, or 6.2mmol/L. Should I keep measuring my blood sugar in every withdrawal that I have, or was this just because I didn't eat for 5 hours and my prior meal wasn't a large one?",1,"irritable, brain - fogged"

So yesterday I decided to take 50mg of my adhd meds instead of my regular 30mg. I had a headache but was really calm. I felt like I was on autopilot but didn't mind.

So today I liked the feeling of being just on autopilot so I took 70mg and god was this the worst decission ever. I'm currently in bed nauseous my chest under my left breast has been aching and I have a dull headache. Is it safe to go back down suddenly to my 30? Or will I have withdrawl symptoms (i take 2 meds idk if the withdrawl is from my zoloft or my adhd meds methylphenidate) my heart rate has been beating way faster than normal and i've only had a few sips of water and a cup of milk today. My hands are very shaky along with my body. (currently 4:30 pm I took my meds around 10am)

  
My vision is now starting to get a bit blurry and i'm getting nervous I'm scared to call poison control because I don't want them to come to my house since my parent's would be furious at me I just wanna know like what they do mostly or if I'm not overdosing and i'm just in full blown panic",1,withdrawl

Include a photo if relevant will post in comments 

To keep it short, 6 weeks ago I had surgery and begrudgingly took ceproflexin (I don't recall the dosage) 4x a day per surgeons orders. 

I took preventative steps as I am very sensitive to antibiotics. One diflucan the day before surgery. One mid antibiotic course. One the day after it ended. 

Developed a yeast infection rash on my sternum approx 1 week after antibiotic course ended. Took another diflucan (all of these diflucan 150mg). Did not clear up. Used nystatin cream preciously prescribed for similar issue. Cleared up this rash. 

Developed a host of unusual systems i would not have related to fungal infection: rapid heart beat, disassociation, confusion (extreme), fever, acid reflux (severe), swollen esophagus and ultimately more rashes under my armpits and in various other locations on my body. 

Ended up at urgent care. Very close to a septic fungal infection. Got liquid nystatin. Throat got better quickly. Thrush in my mouth, esophagus and the urgent care doctor assumed also in my stomach? Causing the acid reflux. 

Another, stronger, round of diflucan, oral nystatin, and nystatin cream, all signs pointed to I was heading in the right direction. Fever subsided just last week, just in time for my follow up with primary care....and a lovely little rash all across my chest (where I just had surgery for breast reduction) to appear

Doc says bacterial folliculitis and says antibiotics are used to treat. Nearly had a panic attack given my recent experience and how there is still thrush plaques on my tongue. 

She gave gel antibiotic instead, instructed to use dial soap. It's been a week. It is not clearing up. 

I feel bad still. Not AS bad as I was feeling. But still not good. Not clear headed. Not like myself. It's so hard to describe to people and they are losing patience with me for not bouncing back from a ""yeast infection"" very quickly. 

Ultimately I've taken 8 doses of diflucan, the last 3 being 200 mg instead. 

Now that I'm a LITTLE clearer headed than i was, I'm questioning how on earth i could've taken such a strong antibiotic that wiped out all bacteria in my body causing this systemic fungal infection whilst still getting bacterial skin folliculitis. 

Doc told me my immune system is extremely weak right now and is jiggling a lot between the surgery and these various infections... 

To add insult to injury, earned that I have developed an allergy to dilfucan and have been breaking out in hives with each dose. 

I'm extremely frustrated, tired, growing impatient with this recovery process, unsure how to impress upon my family and friends what's happening to me, as I'm ""not hospitalized, so must not be that bad"" (paraphrasing), and just don't know who to turn to. 

Personally I think this rash is not bacterial and instead is fungal. But I'm told that if it's fungal it will itch and smell fungal... both of which it does not. The dial soap seems to irritate it, and the gel does nothing for it. I switched to a mild tee tree castile soap which seems to be providing relief from the irritation. It is warm to the touch, but just barely. 

To note, I also still am having thrush symptoms although they are getting better. This rash was also on my face / is on my face in the form of such severe acne I haven't experienced since those hellish teenage hormonal years. Photos attached. Cropped as this rash is on my chest. 

I'm looking for anything really. Advice, ideas. Things to try, to check. This has been going on for a month and I've been off work for nearly 6 weeks given the whole situation..

This got long, there is more but I wanted to keep it concise as possible. Thank you for anyone who contributes, it's greatly appreciated.

"Struggling a bit to get my head around all of this, I’d appreciate some insight/advice.

During eye test had a sudden onset episode of overwhelming weakness. Realised I couldn’t see properly out of my left eye (or maybe couldn’t make it focus?) and felt very heavy, could hardly lift my head off the machine. Also difficulty holding the clicker part of the machine. Difficulty thinking and holding conversation. After a few minutes, with help I was able to stand and move, I sat resting my head on a table. No dizziness or vertigo. When I went to have a drink it was incredibly hard to move my arm, both mentally and physically. Strong desire to keep my eyes closed because it felt too much effort to open them. Affecting both sides of body. 

A&E said potential stroke so CT and bloods. CT was clear. Symptoms seemed to gradually improve but then worsened again periodically (possibly triggered by visual input of ceilings moving when I was wheeled around?). When resting my head kept pulling to the left, felt like muscles in my neck pulling it to a weird position. I’d reset it back to the middle and it would slowly happen again. Tingling, cramping and muscle twitching in both legs. Neurological examination was fine, but it felt like an incredible mental effort! Lifting legs felt extremely difficult but could do both. Over a few hours things slowly improved to mostly just feeling exhausted and weak. 
Had MRI and moved to assessment ward overnight where I had pain in both legs for a few hours and heart felt like it was absolutely pounding. 
Dr overnight seemed to jump very quickly onto the fact that I’d experienced migraines and tension headaches in the past, and told me it was probably a hemiplegic migraine.
Felt ok next morning up and was able to walk to the toilet, felt off balance/weak but functional.
Then suddenly of felt overwhelmingly hot, heart racing, constant palpitations for a while. Slowed down after a bit, but then when I sat up to eat lunch I suddenly overwhelmingly heavy and spaced out again. Slowly improved to normal ish again. 
MRI results were ambiguous, with several small dots of high signal, planned to do another. 2 or 3 further repeat episodes through the day - one when I pushed hands into the bed to move myself, had extreme discomfort from the heat and fast HR before this. 
Next morning felt much better, ate, showered etc. (still tingling, cramp and twitching muscles in both legs/feet). Repeat MRI head and top of spine. Felt relaxed during scan, but had another episode of intense weakness when I got up from the machine.

Repeat MRI clear, just showed some bulging discs. neurologist came to see me that afternoon - happy no stroke or tumour. Believes I have FND so need to rest and can get back to life when I feel ready.
When I asked what that meant, how to start getting back to life, any help available, she gave me the name of a website and shut down the conversation.
Thankfully had a bit more help from F2 dr before discharge, but still feeling very lost in where to go from here, why it’s FND, how we know it’s not anything else,what to expect next, etc!

Edited to add: I thought things were settling down since being home, but today have had palpitations/sensation of racing heart for hours (HR 95-110), pressure and pulsing in head, clumsiness and weirdly, my, hands, knees and thighs turning purple ish when I stand.

"30 F, 78.5kg 5ft4 UK, mother of 2 under 4, stomach issues on and off, IBS supposedly.

 I was in hospital last year, after 5 weeks in and out, diagnosed with mild gastritis ans inflammation.

Symptoms:
abdominal pain, bloating, urge for pooping but sometimes can't, as if it feels inflamed, and the next day diarrhea, hot flushes, nausea, major fatigue, didn't eat anything solid for 5 weeks due to nausea and it basically just rejecting any food, constant mucus in any bowel movement.
 
Diagnoses: mild gastritis discovered from upper gi tract endoscopy and biopsies. Colon was not looked at only down to stomach. 40mg omeprazole a day and antisickness prescribed and seems to clear up.

I'm going through something similar right now and the omeprazole just isn't cutting it this time (I have not been able to wean off since starting in hospital last year, was down to 20mg but started 40mg again now)

 I checked my results from last year and found a feacal calprotectin score of >1800ug, which had a note to be urgently looked at with gastro etc. This result unfortunately came on the day of my endoscopy and was never talked about as they said it must be gastritis. I asked a different Dr for another referral yesterday and showed them the test result and he was shocked this wasnt investigated. So I will be going private.

Other issues- could be linked 

I was told I have non headache migraines which cause these symptoms which could be linked with cycles. 

I have high liver ALT tests up and down since 2021, slight cirrhosis, maybe fatty liver/non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which calmed down when I lost weight/had a baby, back to raised again but not too high.

What do you all think? I'm done with having so many symptoms and I feel I jsut need to be looked at as a whole, the drs just see me and its like, here we go again! So, I want to know when I go private, do I go to gastro and another kind of Dr? Or will gastro help with the majority of this and refer on?",1,"abdominal, diarrhea, hot flushes"
"Hi! I’ve been on Methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) for two days. I decided to not take it for the third day as I was planning on drinking alcohol. That day my heart started beating extremely fast and continued to do so for hours until I felt dizzy and called the ambulance. Afterwards, EKG tests revealed no abnormalities and they sent me home. But I still continue to suffer from heart palpitations and a lot of anxiety. I am 22 years old, have normal blood pressure, normal BMI and I’m active. After this, I can barely go on a walk without my heart rate rising to abnormal levels and this anxiety is extremely uncomfortable. What should I do ?

TLDR: The doctor told me that it looks like an old fracture, and they are not going to attempt to heal it. They recommended I use an aircast and orthopedic inserts if necessary. Surgery is an option if it becomes an issue, but not recommended unless necessary. Can I really do nothing to heal this, and does it seem to be an old fracture? I also have developed a tiny bump right above the fracture that is 1/4 inch in diameter, more pronounced when foot is flexed back, less pronounced if foot is pointed down like a ballerina, no pain to touch slightly firm, not very visible but can be felt easily.

\_\_\_\_

I am worried that I may have convinced the doctor too well that this could be an old fracture, and they went along with it. I hope someone can advise me on whether I can heal this and what steps I should take next.

I cannot remember when I may have fractured my foot. I have experienced foot pain for a long time in both feet from activities like jumping or rolling my heel. In recent months, the pain in my right foot has been increasing, feeling achy even on easy days. I also noticed that the shape of my right foot seemed to be different, but it was not overly painful or tender to touch, just a vague bruise sensation.

Although I told the doctor that I am unsure when this could have happened and it could have been years ago, it has only been a real issue in the last few months. I have been taking daily walks during my lunch break at work for a while and have done some hiking in the past year without any major concerns, just normal foot achiness. I do like to wear toe socks and wide toebox shoes, I generally walk and run with the ball of my foot touching ground first and don't heel strike.

Since getting the X-rays, I have been wearing the aircast whenever possible and using KT tape as well.

A few days ago, I experienced a sharp pain in my foot after attempting a power slide on the floor with socks on. I had some extra pain for 24 hours that has since subsided, and I have been limping to avoid putting too much pressure on the foot. I noticed the next day that there is a tiny bump right above the fracture that is 1/4 inch in diameter, more pronounced when foot is flexed back, less pronounced if foot is pointed down like a ballerina, no pain to touch slightly firm but no pain when pressed.  However, I am able to stand on it with minimal discomfort and was walking on it without knowing it was fractured before all of this.

I want to ensure that I am taking all necessary steps to prevent needing surgery in the future, and if this is indeed a recent fracture, I would like to properly heal it.

I'm meeting with my normal doctor for review of my ADHD meds soon and plan to bring it up with her as well.",1,pain in

Its been 1-2 years since I stopped taking it and im still having these weird effects.

I took Clozapine after being misdiagnosed with schizoaffective. I can't remember the dose, but it was pretty high. I could barely lift my head up and would drool on myself, I was tired af. I coughed up mucus all the time, felt super sick at times. I would hear loud noises like banging or screaming, and id wake up with a start in a middle of the night.

"I am looking for opinions/suggestions on how I should handle a difficult situation. This is my first time posting on reddit. I apologize in advance if I have done anything incorrectly. 

Here are the questions and pertinent information;
I had been prescribed methylphenidate for several years for ADHD and severe central sleep apnea (I fall asleep randomly). This medication is immeasurably helpful in allowing me to function in day to day life. How helpful it is became very apparent over the last eight months. When I realized I was pregnant, I immediately stopped taking methylphenidate and notified my prescribing doctor. I didn't take it for the whole pregnancy. It was difficult for me to complete normal daily tasks, and my home has fallen apart as far as my normal maintenance. I also have a four year old that I have been struggling to keep up with. I did my research and found that methylphenidate is safe to take while breastfeeding (I planned on breastfeeding my son). I was looking forward to getting my prescription back, regaining my normal function in day to day life, as well as getting my hime back in order. A week before I was due to have my second son, I messaged my doctor explaining that since methylphenidate is safe to take while breastfeeding, I would like to continue taking it after I my son was born. I also told the doctor that I planned on breastfeeding. I was disappointed when my doctor had the nurse send a response message that stated ""Dr. X does not prescribe stimulants to breastfeeding women"". I cannot possibly keep up with a four year old, and a newborn without my medication. I need it now more than ever before. It also plays a part in the safety of my children as without the medication, I sometimes fall asleep randomly out of my control. For now, I have my Mother help me. But, she is 65 and a four year old, and newborn are a lot for her.


 When I took my newborn to his first pediatrician appointment, I asked the pediatrician his opinion on the safety of breastfeeding while on methylphenidate. I explained the situation to him. His response was, that taking methylphenidate is NOT a reason to stop breastfeeding, nor is breastfeeding a reason to stop taking methylphenidate. He also stated that he had never heard of a doctor refusing to prescribe methylphenidate due to breastfeeding and that a Mother being unable to stay awake or focus on basic tasks is more hazardous to babies health than methylphenidate in breastmilk. He proceeded to print off the information he had regarding the safety of breastfeeding while taking methylphenidate and included his signature at the bottom. 

I feel like my doctor is allowing her personal beliefs to affect my care. I don't know that giving her the information from the pediatrician will change her mind. I think it will more than likely make her angry.  I am looking for opinions or suggestions on how to handle this situation. Do I stop breastfeeding my son? Do I give her the information the pediatrician printed off? Is it acceptable for a Dr. to make medical decisions that go against medical facts for their patients based on personal feelings or opinions?

"28M AFAB, 171 cm, 80 kg, smoker. i take venlafaxine and methylphenidate types of drugs daily to help with depression and adhd.

hello docs,
im a codeine addict and an alcoholic in recovery, i've been sober for 16 months. 

at the beginning of this month, i had a septo+rhinoplasty. i have told the doctors, nurses etc. that im an addict and that i worry abt relapse bc of anesthesia. they were like uhmm ok no worries.

since the surgery, i've been having severe dissociative episodes. (idk if that's the right term) i mean severe as in i've felt present only a couple of hours during the whole first two (or three idk?) weeks following the surgery. i've been getting brain zaps, my blood pressure has been high ever since, i feel like my entire body is shaking at all times. i've been craving alcohol so much that i force myself to stay at home rather than going out bc im afraid i'll end up buying some from the market near by.

i just dug up my medical records bc i suspected they might have given me codeine during/after surgery -despite the countless times i've pleaded them not to- and realized they've given me tramadol.

with that being said, i've also been under immense pressure for 2 weeks following the surgery bc of reasons that are not related to it.

SO, my question is this: is it possible for me to have withdrawal from tramadol even tho im originally addicted to codeine and alcohol (+benzos and cannabis in case they're worth to mention)

OOOR am i just being paranoid and freaking out bc i've been very stressed and im just having the weirdest sleeping problems and maybe this is all happening bc of the ?? idk something else, anything else.

(i currently have a therapist in a hospital that specializes in addiction, i will be going to see them in a couple of days and im not in immediate danger of relapse, im just really freaked out rn)

"i (20f, 5 ft 6, 140-ish lbs, white as a sheet, diagnosed with tourette's, adhd, asthma, mdd, and gad, taking methylphenidate 36mg, bupropion 150mg, and good old cetirizine hydrochloride 10mg, never smoke or do drugs, only drink on holidays) have had tourette's for about 15 years now, and my tics have always been most prevalent in my eyes. one of my primary tics is that i'll look all the way up/down/left/right as a tic, to the point where it strains my eyes -- i feel the ""stretch."" i do this an uncountable number of times a day, almost certainly in the hundreds, for a few seconds at a time, often several or many times in a row, and it's only been getting worse (which, yes, does get in the way of my general ability to see, thank you for asking).

lately (the last few days or so), i've sometimes been getting pain in the parts of my eyes where it usually strains, as well as vertigo (? my vision spins) and...not blurred vision, exactly -- it's like my eyes have trouble focusing again -- when i have those tics. in the past, i've experienced a lot of exhaustion in my eyes from moving them so much, but never anything like this -- though, my eye tics have never been quite this bad. i've never thought about it before, but i'm beginning to get concerned that this repetitive strain could be causing actual damage to my eyes. could it?

i also sometimes poke/hit my eyes as a tic, but i close them beforehand, and i don't think i poke or hit hard enough to do any actual damage. but i suppose it could be contributing to the general strain i'm putting them under, so i'll mention it.

i'm not expecting a diagnosis, just a general idea of whether i should be concerned, at which point i would probably schedule an appointment with an optometrist, or if i can safely ignore it.

i am looking into treatment for my tourette's, as my tics have been getting progressively worse over the past five years and it's been interfering with my daily functioning for a while now, but if you know anything about tourette's, you also know that the treatment options aren't exactly great, and the waitlist to see a neurologist is long. so for now, i'm stuck with them.

(side note: if any of you know how i can compensate for how hard my tics make it for me to see while i wait for my neurology appointment in november, i welcome any and all ideas. i almost got hit by a car the other day because i couldn't see where i was going.)

"So I’ve been on 40-60 mg of methylphenidate a day, 20 mg of paroxetine and I’m an avid nicotine user (nicotine pouches), and I also take around 100-200 mg of caffeine a day. I’ve also lost around 30 kg in a few months, which may be a contributing factor to some of my symptoms. 

I know that methylphenidate and also nicotine can lead to elevated levels of norepinephrine and also epinephrine, and as a result can cause high Blood Pressure and also anxiety, but I don’t know if what I’m experiencing is beyond what’s normal. 

To give some insight into symptoms, I have a constant feeling of general anxiety that isn’t triggered by anything, it’s just there. It’s kind of just simmering and isn’t very outwardly noticeable. I have to take deep breaths sometimes for no reason, I do a lot of different compulsive things such as biting my lip, blink excessively and almost have to press my eye lids shut, gnash teeth etc. a lot of anxiety related symptoms. On top of that, I feel physically exhausted, I’m not tired like I want to go to sleep, but rather tired like I don’t have the strength to get out of bed. I also have a lot of high blood pressure related symptoms, such as getting lightheaded and loosing vision temporarily when standing up. 

A few months ago, the methylphenidate was really effective at making me energized and want to study all day, but right now I’m just taking it because I like to believe it would make a difference.

I took a blood test just a few days ago for unrelated reasons, but everything came back normal and within range. 

It’s not like I know what is causing this, it’s the combination of nicotine and methylphenidate, where surprisingly methylphenidate is the milder cause. I hope this doesn’t lead to long term health problems such as cardiovascular conditions, usually you can feel when your body isn’t healthy. I can’t go to my prescribing physician, because he sees me only a few times a year, because he apparently has more important things to do, so reddit would be the best place for advice for now. 

Hoping to get advice on what I should do, but I fear it’s very obvious. ",1,"levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, high blood pressure, high blood pressure, lightheaded, loosing vision"
"I'm 29 AFAB, for context not based in the US, only med I take regularly is bupropion (and sporadically methylphenidate - I have ADHD). Exacly a week ago, on Monday, I started coming down with something but my only symptoms were feeling weak and having waves of hot and cold (chills/sweating), with a very slightly increased temperature (36.8 C, I usually have the nice round 36.6). On Friday it got to 37.2 and I got fed up and went to the GP - at this point those and a very slight runny nose were my only symptoms but I wanted to be on the safe side and also get a note from work, because I'm sensitive to temp changes and fevers are super rare for me. To my surprise one of the things the GP perscribed was antibiotics. His approach to me during that visit was behaving like I don't exist and only after I pressed him to tell me why he thought it was bacterial he told me it was because it had been going on for so long (by then 4 days). My colds usually last a week and I wasn't super convinced by this, especially since aside from the bacterial/viral conundrum I always fear yeast infections\*. However it has now been a week. Over the weekend I got a sore throat and thought that maybe this change meant it was my standard cold, but other than that everything is the same, every day around 37C temperatures and feeling poorly, so I decided to start the course.

My questions are the following:

1) would you say this was a total stab in the dark on the doctor's part or bacterial is more likely than viral (I know no one can give me a definitive answer)? And why?

2) If I don't feel an improvement after x days, is that an indication that it's viral or it's equally possible that it's bacterial but wrong antibiotic?

3) I know you shouldn't pause antibiotics and I know why, but are there any exceptions for if you start feeling \*worse\*?

I've never been perscribed antibiotics with this little explanation and although I started them, not knowing what else to do, I am still not convinced this is what I need and a little worried. I would love some reassurance and/or an idea of what to look out for in case this is the wrong call. 

Thank you!

"age: 32
Female 
Non smoker, non drinker, no drugs- in recovery 
PMH: anxiety, depression, substance abuse 

Meds: Currently taking prednisone, Wellbutrin, methylphenidate, symbicort, albuterol and newly added seroquel. 

Edit to add:

Height: 5’5 weight 175 (up ~10lbs from start of prednisone)
Exercise: almost daily up until starting the prednisone

Eating: out of control. 

Sleep: poor sleep hygiene currently. Have not slept more than a few hours a night since starting the prednisone. I’ve been much more sleep deprived with my children as newborns, but never felt this scared or bad.  





Also taking symbicort and albuterol 

Can I stop taking my prednisone? Having adverse psych side effects. 

I’m on an 18 day course of prednisone for a lingering issue with my lungs. I think my doctor said that it was like bronchitis that had never fully cleared up. I haven’t had to use my rescue inhaler much recently, and I’ve been taking my Symbicort normally. 

I’m on day 11  and tapering down by 10 mg every three days. Tomorrow would be my last day of 30mg. 

I talked to my psychiatrist because I’m having extremely unpleasant side effects. at first, I didn’t really understand what was going on, and I thought that the prednisone was just making me agitated but over the last few days, things have gotten noticeably worse. I wasn’t sure how to talk about this because I felt embarrassed, and honestly scared of the way I was feeling. Not at risk of harming myself or anybody else, but I’m feeling very disconnected from reality, and having feelings of anhedonia. This has been an extremely scary feeling. I have suffered from anxiety and depression for most of my life, but this is unlike that. I celebrated 14 years in recovery earlier this month, but the way I’m feeling today makes me feel like I’m on like on another planet.  I don’t feel anxious, but I feel scared. I feel so disconnected I feel from reality right now.  I know my husband and my kids and my house are all familiar things to me, but they kind of seem so far away in a sense. 

My psychiatrist  told me it sounds like the prednisone is what’s causing this and he’s seen it before especially in people with anxiety.  He instructed me to continue taking my Wellbutrin, and hold off on my methylphenidate, but to add 25mg of seroquel at night, and to stop the prednisone.

 however, he said that I should talk to the pulmonologist about stopping the prednisone before I do so in order to avoid more problems. 
My pulmonologist is away on vacation right now. I called his office and they said he might give me a call back but they’re not sure. I don’t really expect him to give me a call back and he told me that he would be away, I was hoping that they would have somebody that would be able to advise me. 

I’m not looking to start a new medication to treat my lungs right now, I just wanna make sure I’m not going to end up feeling worse by stopping the prednisone abruptly. 

Can anyone advise? My plan is to just stop the prednisone. Can anyone give me a reason why I shouldn’t do this? I’m honestly afraid to put any more of it in my body. I can’t stand this feeling, and cannot imagine how much people suffer with psychosis and other serious issues like this. 

Thanks in advance. I’m an RN but this is not within my scope! Please don’t roast me, I’m hanging on by a thread!!

"18F, i take methylphenidate short release ~5-6 a days a week. 

for the past month ive suddenly developed pretty bad insomnia, where i’m restless, have heart palpitations and my mind is really alert. unsurprisingly they occur nights after i take methylphenidate. i end up falling asleep at earliest 3am, latest 7am - never. in the past month, i don’t think ive slept longer than 8 hours and i’d say on average i sleep around 4-3 hours. 

firstly, ive never had insomnia from methylphenidate until now, and ive been taking it for 2 years. and before this month, i needed ~8 hours sleep to feel well rested. i never had even the slightest problem falling asleep, i would always fall asleep immediately. in fact, 2-3 years ago i would often uncontrollably fall asleep for ~2hrs in the late afternoon due to extreme fatigue. 

however, despite me probably being in very big sleep debt, i experience no symptoms. i am wide awake all throughout the day. and i drink no coffee. at my worst, i get tired normally at around 9pm instead of never😭. i have adhd so the “trouble concentrating” is hard to measure, but ive definitely been fine cognitively in terms of rate of thought processes.  i feel pretty emotionally regulated.

"Long-winded context: My six-year-old son has been participating in a ""diagnostic classroom"" at a local (well known and respected) rehabilitation hospital since mid-November. He was diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) last summer, and was given the chance to participate in the diagnostic classroom in order to develop some skills for classroom success.
The pediatrician on staff does an assessment of all participants and she and the other staff (including the teacher, a speech-language pathologist and a psychologist) all believe that my son has ADHD. I'm not 100% behind that diagnosis, because it disregards the sensory-seeking and repetitive behaviours he displayed in the past. However, he has made a huge jump in maturation since beginning the program (he also turned six), so I can't hang my hat on previous behavoiurs which he may have outgrown. And I'm not a medical professional.

I do, though, conduct research and fact check for a living. Before the Christmas break the pediatrician told me that she wanted to put Boyo on a non-stimulant medication that would help him focus: strattera. She said she'd send some literature home for review, and wanted to get him on the drug immediately after Christmas (the diagnostic classroom concludes on Jan 14 and he returns to his regular Grade 1 classroom; however, we have 'access' to this pediatrician for six months as a transition). She didn't send anything home with him, so I did some looking on my own. 

What I found--the side effects re: aggression, irritability, depression and suicidal behaviours--worry me a great deal. There is a history of depression and bipolar disorder in my family, and depression in son's father's family. (which the pediatrician knows.) I also read a study (midwest university in the U.S.; can't remember where right now) that found that a large number of children who started on strattera needed to move on to other therapies, as it just didn't work for them. (more than 50 per cent, I think.)

I plan on asking the pediatrician the following (how are potential side-effects in mood monitored in someone who is too young for accurate self-reporting), but wanted to sample this group too. After all, you're the largest one I know, and I am always stunned at the breadth of knowledge in the Reddit community.

Has anyone had their child on strattera? If so, what were the side effects, if any? Has anyone had particularly good, bad or ugly experiences?

And, if your child is medicated with stimulant or non-stimulant therapy, would you be willing to share whether you are glad you made the decision, regret it, or or or ...?

I'm really out to sea here.

"Myself, after being prescribed a combination of Ridalin, Prozac, Strattera, and Adderall during a period of 12-14 years by my childhood psychiatrist, I now have absolutely terrible short-term and long-term memory loss (long-term is the worst affected; I cannot recall roughly 80 percent of what I learn from the semester in high school prior to summer vacation afterwards).  As well, I have experienced the decay of my ability to express myself, and I will elaborate further on this subject if requested.  According to a friend who is 1 year away from completing his degree in pharmacology (I trust him quite a bit on this subject, but of course not enough for him to diagnose me outright), I have symptoms of ""absence seizures"", my attention span is, by far, much worse than how I remember it being in Elementary School; although this could be false due to the aforementioned memory loss issues.

This is what I can think of at the moment, and it would probably be helpful to others to know what I have been legitimately diagnosed with.  This includes Tourette's Syndrome, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Restless Legs Syndrome, Non-Verbal Learning Disorder, and Dyslexia.  Immediately after finding out from the wonders of the internets how many of the drugs prescribed to me were pretty much legal versions of speed, I quit taking them.  This was about 2 years back.

"I am 19 years old. I have recently started taking Prozaic for anxiety. I also take Strattera and Concerta each morning along with it (for ADD). Anyway, it seems like this feeling started around the time I started taking Prozaic (about 2 weeks ago) and has gotten more noticeable.

I constantly have this 'sensation' in my lowest stomach area + penis that almost feels orgasmic, but not as strong. I do not mean orgasmic, as in pleasurable, because it is persistent and uncomfortable to feel this with everything I do throughout the day. It almost feels like my stomach is a little weak and somewhat contracting when I feel this. I have tried masturbating, which felt just as good if not better than normal, but it didn't end up helping (it didn't make the feeling any less noticeable even immediately after masturbating).

I have been searching online for a long time tonight to no avail. No one else seems to have ever had this problem before based on my searches (although I'm sure people have).

"My (53f) daughter (25f) has not lived with me since she left for college 8 years ago.  She has always been fiercely independent and a real go-getter.  I’d say we have a fairly good relationship.  She tells me what she wants me to know and I try to be supportive without being controlling.   I was surprised when she told me she was Dx’d as bipolar several years ago, but she was an adult and seemed comfortable with the Dx so I just tried to support her the best I could.   Recently, she started seeing a new psych/counselor team. They thought the bipolar was misdiagnosed and changed her dx to ADHD w/ anxiety and depression. They took her off a mood stabilizer (I don’t know the name) and put her on Strattera. Since then, I feel like every time I talk to her her personality changes to the point where I don’t recognize her.   She also started a new relationship and is diving in much faster than she has ever done before.  At first I thought her change in behavior and personality was tied to the new BF, but I’ve met him a few times and he seemed pretty normal so now I’m wondering if the medication can be the cause. 

Here are some examples. She started being extremely obsessed with her appearance, to the point where she seems shallow.  She acts like she is entitled to be taken care of financially. She works just enough to pay her bills with no motivation to save or be better/improve.  She went on food stamps and brags about it.  She acts like a high maintenance drama girl- which is so not her! (She was an athlete in HS and college who was comfortable in sweatpants in public.) I am also concerned that she might be binging and purging.  The other day we were in my car together and I made a positive comment about someone parallel parking on a busy city street and my daughter said something really rude. Something along the lines of “ugh she’s a fucking loser”  That is so out of character!  Also the way she behaves around her BF is kind of weird for her. Calling him “babe” constantly. Acting like they are practically married.  She’s only been seeing him a few months and he doesn’t act like this around her.  About a month ago I got a call in the middle of the night from her friend saying my daughter was having a paranoid episode. She patched in my daughter and we were able to calm her down. My daughter blamed it on some pot she had smoked, but I thought it was more dramatic than that would justify. As some of these changes presented I was thinking they were tied to different things- like the anti-work movement and a personal glow-up. But the more they pile up the more I am afraid something else is going on.  And when I set this to a timeline, the change in her personality started shortly after the change in her medication.

Before taking strattera I didn’t have these feelings of intense anger at all. The last few days I haven’t really eaten because it hurts to eat. Like my food gets stuck in my throat. I’ve been to my primary care doctor and they didn’t see anything wrong. They gave me a steroid to help with the swelling.

"My doc switched me from Wellbutrin to Strattera for ADHD. I also have been taking Prozac for about a year now for anxiety/OCD. I have just began taking Strattera in the morning when I wake up, 40 mg and have been feeling extremely nauseous after I eat anything and occasionally vomiting. If anyone is on this medicine and can help relieve these side effects please let me know! I am also an avid marijuana smoker so that helps with the nausea but it is not something I can partake in just anytime I want since I cannot smoke inside my house.",1,"nauseous, vomiting, nausea"
"Hi! I just started taking Strattera for ADHD management, and felt really weird about 30 minutes after I took it today- my skin felt very tingly and sensitive and I felt like my body temperature wasn't self regulating very well. Honestly it feels very similar to when I used to do Ecstasy and it would first start kicking in. I'm not sure I like it. Has anyone else had this experience? Does it get better? 

Some background: I'm also on Wellbutrin SR for depression, but it's not really doing a lot for my general ADHD symptoms; I have a history of substance abuse so my psychiatrist wants to try the Strattera before going back to stimulant medications. ",1,"tingly, sensitive, adhd"
"Hello,

While I know Reddit might not be the place to discuss this, but I really have nowhere else to go. I visited multiple psychiatrists and psychologists, and no one was able to tell me what is exactly wrong with me.

So I will vent out here, to see if someone has gone through something similar to my situation.

For background:
- 25 Y.O woman, working a full time job at a very demanding career (consulting)
- Diagnosed with anxiety and ADD (problems with concentration)
- Recurring suicidal thoughts, no actions or measure taken or will be taken though
- Throughout my life, I’ve always been quiet and calm. Up till recently 
- I have taken strattera for a couple of months, stopped taking it
- I have taken Brintllix for a couple of weeks, stopped taking it

So what happened in a span of 5 months: 
- Went through a rage, was talking with one of my family members casually, until they mentioned something I don’t like. My face and neck became paralyzed and I started screaming uncontrollably. Cognitively, I was wondering what is wrong with me, but physically I couldn’t control myself
- Went through 2 extreme panic attacks, and the trigger for both were very stupid. One of them was because the car gate accidentally hit my head whilst I was taking my order. I was normal, until a few minutes passed by, where I was hyperventilating, shaking, crying, you name it. 
- Went through a nervous breakdown at work, when I was demanded to complete a task quickly that I did not understand. Ended up scratching my face, hitting myself, and hyperventilating.
- Went through a similar self-harm pattern after that, when I had a very simple argument with my sister. I kept telling her to close the topic, and she insisted on speaking about it, to the point where I started uncontrollably harming myself, hitting scratching breaking things. I didn’t scream or hit her though, I was just hitting myself whenever I am alone. And whenever I remember what happened, a feel a STRONG rage, that I have to punch the air

Those are major incidents that happened to me, that I did not experience before. 

I know that I should seek help, I did. But no one helped. I was told it was “mere anxiety”, but how can anxiety lead to all of this? Another doctor told me it’s stress, but even when I take time to retreat from work, I still go back? 

Would love to hear your thoughts on this :( and if someone went through a similar experience. Please leave nice and helpful comments, or else just don’t bother commenting.

Thank you  ",1,
"I have a psychiatrist and a therapist, and so far all I’ve got from my treatment is that I have ADHD lol I was diagnosed with GAD and depression a long time ago. One of my previous psych docs thought I had Bipolar Type 2, but when I got my new psychiatrist back in December 2023, she took away my bipolar diagnosis without doing any kind of assessment and said it was more likely that I just have ADHD and was misdiagnosed.

I was taken off my mood stabilizer and put on strattera. That helped for about 3 months, but slowly lost effectiveness. I started craving weed and ended up tripping on a heroic dose of LSD. I wasn’t expecting to trip so hard (long story). During my trip I kept fretting that my psychiatrist was wrong and I really do have bipolar, and I was going to end up having an episode and ruining my life (based on past experiences). 

After that LSD trip, I settled back down somewhat. I also had some issues at work. I have this manager that likes to lecture employees and talk down to us when we’ve done something wrong. It really stresses me out because she chews me out the same way an abusive family member did to me when I was a child.

I got in trouble over something small, I forget what it was, but she had me so angry and upset that I started frantically job hunting. I couldn’t get an interview to save my life, however, and I started spiraling emotionally. 

I was having racing thoughts and severe intrusive thoughts about SH. I came onto Reddit and started posting questions about places to move with good job markets. I impulsively started applying for jobs out of state, and then completely lost the plot and signed a lease to rent a room before I’ve even been hired anywhere.

I guess it’s for the best that I move because my home is very toxic, and I haven’t been doing well living with my family for a long time. 

I want to be excited that I’m moving, but the anxiety and spinning thoughts just won’t go away. I’m still having intrusive thoughts about SH. I won’t hurt myself, but it’s very taxing that I can’t stop thinking about it.

I’m taking medication to help with my ADHD and depression, and I’m also taking something to help me sleep.

I’m just not sure why I’m struggling so much right now. My psychiatrist increased my strattera dosage, and that helped with the worst of my spiraling, but I just can’t relax at all. My brain is so loud and I just want some mental peace.

I don’t really know where I’m going with this. Maybe I just needed to get it off my chest. 

Anyways, thank you for reading if you got this far, and if you have anything you’d like to say, I’m happy to read and respond to comments.",1,depression
"Hey Guys, I could Really Use some Love and Support right now.

I Struggle with Depression, Anxiety and Diagnosed ADHD. My Current Med Stack is Wellbutrin 37.5mg,Strattera 40mg and that’s it

I was on Prozac 20mg but I’ve been off it Cold Turkey for around 24 Days now.

I was Doing really Swell on Wellbutrin for the First 20 or so Days. Then all of a sudden at work I just got hit with this wave of Sadness/Dread/Hopelessness and it feels like a Struggle to even exist right now, thus the title “treading water” im faking it till I make it. 

I have Horrible Insomnia, I had this while I was Depressed, the day I got hit with that wave. I got maybe 1 hour of light sleep. I feel like it’s definitely effecting my mood. Thing is I don’t know what causing the WORSENING insomnia

Is it the Wellbutrin?

The Strattera?

It could even be coming off Prozac in some form of withdrawal.

"Recently I’ve been thinking about my Mental Health and Emotional State A lot, I have Depression Anxiety and ADHD newly diagnosed. I haven’t really had time to mull over that but as I continue with my life after being brought back from the Brink by a amazing Psychiatrist and Medication. things seem a little Grey. Like almost Mundane sort of. I feel very Middle of The Road about everything which is Great in some ways as it’s helping with depression but not so much as making me Content. I got on Prozac it messed me up so I got off it now I’m on Wellbutrin and Strattera. I feel meh. Like I can still laugh and feel sad but sometimes it’s like the Happiness is Artificial? Or Fake? Like it’s there just Blunted and I’m not sure as to why. Like It’s hard to enjoy things I used to. Video Games, Reading ETC.

im diagnosed 4 things and working on 3 more; nonspecific adhd symptoms, skin picking disorder, GAD, and recurring depression. i’ve been in therapy since i was like 10 years old and i’m 18 now, so i know the drill by this point.

i recently went to an inpatient facility for suicidal ideation and eating disorder behaviors and it was traumatizing and terrible. they doubled my medication within the span of 2 days and i was a walking zombie until weeks after i got out. i went from 25 of strattera and 15 of buspar, to 40 of strattera and 30 of buspar.

i just recently started seeing an amazing psychiatrist who listens and is truly empathetic towards my trauma and issues, which i am so so grateful for. she suspects a mood or personality disorder and in our first session, she prescribed lamictal. if you don’t know, it’s a mood stabilizer and anti-convulsant typically used to treat bipolar disorder and increases by 25 mg every week until you find the right dose. my strattera and buspar were also upped.

if you’ve been keeping track, i am currently taking 60 of strattera, 60 of buspar, and 25 of lamictal. my body is wrecked and my mind is mush. this is so exhausting and i’m just struggling to exist right now. i’m around 85 lbs and i have no idea if this is too much medicine for my size?

"Hey all, going to try to keep this as concise as possible, but including all the relevant information is still likely to make it a moderately long post. I really appreciate anybody who takes the time to read this.

**Relevant background/history:**

\- Mid 20s, diagnosed ADHD at 10, wasn't prescribed anything due to also having tics

\- Lots of drug abuse between 15-19. 100-500mg MDMA 1-2x/wk, mixing with psychs, etc. 18-19 cocaine a few times a week while drinking. Stopped all non-psychedelics after that.

\- Since 18ish have been tired all the time, 1-2L coffee per day, occasional month long periods of abstinence to see if coffee was the problem, always ended up back in same place

\- Depression and anxiety around 22, also late autism spectrum diagnosis. Doctor suggested that ADHD meds might also deal with the depression and anxiety. They did, and I also became way more capable of basic life tasks -- cleaning, groceries, paying bills on time, socializing, working, etc.

\- No ADHD medication worked for more than 3-6 months at a time. Since then I've tried Dexedrine, Vyvanse, Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin SR, Foquest, Biphentin, Strattera, about 5 SSRIs, 2 SNRIs, Wellbutrin, Modafinil, as well as a bunch of nootropics(racetams, choline, alcar, lions mane, uridine, etc). I've tried all dosage ranges for the ADHD medications, typically have settled at the top for both methylphenidate products and amphetamines, although I suspect with amphetamines I should have been placed closer to the middle or low end. Antidepressants all made things worse, amphetamines worked amazingly for a while and then started to induce paranoia/dysphoria/agitation/obsessiveness, methylphenidate products all worked great, although with a very short duration -- 2.5-3h effectiveness(e.g. SR would be 2.5-3h useful, 2 hours dip, repeat). Despite the duration issues, it's drastically helped everything from depression to anxiety to ADHD. Modafinil was great, but that was a different doctor and only for a month.

\- In the last year or so, I'll use methylphenidate as prescribed for a while, then eventually have 1-5 days of binging. It's not to chase euphoria as there really is never euphoria anymore, it's just to...actually be able to function for the majority of the day. I've never experienced negative side effects due to this(e.g. nothing like amphetamines, HR barely rises, no agitation or anxiety, can still sleep at the end of the day, etc.) with the exception of terrible comedowns and having less medication to actually use properly. People close to me don't notice that I've been taking more during the binges, they just notice that I'm more depressed and less productive on all the other days. Coffee is objectively more stimulating(alertness, anxiety, talkativeness, etc) than methylphenidate for me, even compared to the binges. But the doses scare me. The worst has been a few 24-36 hour binges of 600-900mg in 40-100mg increments. Lately it's more like 200-300mg/day for 4-7 days. It doesn't feel recreational, it's always functional despite being clear abuse. There are certain areas of my life that I struggle immensely to get in order with regular doses, and the binges seem to give me the clarity to actually figure out how to deal with them and take the needed actions.

\- I'm scared of talking to my doctor about this because it is the primary thing that has helped get the majority of my life in order, and at this point the only problem are the binges. I don't want to lose access to a medication that I'd be near non-functional without. I'd switch to Modafinil, but my doctor isn't comfortable prescribing it off-label, and generics from India don't have the same benefits for me, nor does Adrafinil.

\- I'm not sure what to do to stop this pattern. I already do all of the basic health stuff -- exercise, healthy eating, o3/b complex/vit D/magnesium/zinc, melatonin on days where I binge, etc.

\-One option I've thought of is keeping medication in safety deposit box and just walking half an hour to the bank every morning. Alternatively, I'm guessing taking NAC in the morning might help, possibly along with a week off. I dislike taking time off because after a few days of being useless my depression tends to get significantly worse -- it's by staying productive that I feel good about myself and avoid ruminating. One main issue is that invariably after a binge the regular doses do absolutely nothing, so I end up tapering down(e.g. 160, 140, 120, 100, 80) and then run out. So I'm thinking the most actionable time for intervention is when starting a script -- maybe I should start lower than my prescribed dose and try to get my body used to that? Or have careful behavioral interventions set into place(e.g. safety deposit box?)

**My questions:**

1. Given the history of going through all of this(22+) with the same doctor, are my worries about having the prescription taken away unfounded?
2. Even if having the prescription taken away is a legitimate risk, should I still talk to my doctor?
3. Assuming I don't talk to my doctor, any advice on what I can do to get this under control? Whether it be behavioral interventions or adjustments to my medications/supplements.
4. How likely is it that I've done long-term/permanent damage through this? The majority of the research I've read seems to point to methylphenidate not being neurotoxic or particularly dangerous as long as the abuse isn't IV/insufflation, but I'm still concerned about this. Even after taking 1-3 month breaks the medication seems significantly less effective.
5. If there's a non-negligible chance I've done long-term damage, what can I do to attempt to recover to baseline?
6. Any other thoughts or advice is much appreciated.",1,"paranoia, ##ysphoria, adhd"
"Looking back into my teens, I've always been kind of low energy/low mood. I've never been motivated to do more than was expected of me, and if nothing is explicitly expected of me, I always just kinda lay around idling time on the internet or watching tv, maybe reading/writing/doodling some. Also lots of procrastination. 

Starting in 2008 I had 4 babies over 7 years. Each pregnancy/delivery took me lower into depression. I tried different medications years ago to help with the hopelessness and pain; zoloft came the closest to helping the most but nothing significant. I went off it and went unmedicated for a year or so, until earlier this year. Early 2019 I was ready to leave my husband, I had a serious meltdown and I broke a broom in front of the family and scared the hell out of all of us. I finally got a therapist and a psychiatrist for med management, began cymbalta, and came out of the deep depression. I've mended my relationship with my husband and have felt mostly great up until about a month ago. 

My therapist is adamant I have ADHD on top of the depression, due to my lack of motivation and difficulty focusing. She's given me some tools to help with the ADHD and I feel like I've made a good amount of progress there, but still felt ""off"".  I asked my psych if I could try Strattera at the beginning of September.

The strattera had absolutely no effects, good or bad, except that it made it a little harder to get out of bed in the morning. I started showing up late to work a lot.  But no effects on focus or distraction. My husband went away for 4 days in mid-September and I did surprisingly well with the household and work load while he was gone. I had a decent amount of energy for chores and wanted him to come home to a clean house and happy children. We texted a lot while he was gone and I was over the top happy for him to come home. I called out that Sunday for our reunion and it felt like the best day of my life. Medication-wise, during this time, I forgot a few afternoon doses of the strattera. Also on Sunday I realized I forgot to fill my medication box with the morning dose of strattera, so I'm not exactly sure when I stopped taking it (if I HAD to guess, it was probably the previous day.)

**HERE COMES THE GOOD PART IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE READING THE BACKGROUND**

That night, after 5 beers and some pot, my husband was asleep next to me and all of a sudden I thought he had been controlling my mind with orgasms for the past half year. I got it in my mind that I had to leave him somehow but that I had to keep playing along or else he would kill me if he found out I knew. During this episode he woke up to me crying. Some tiny part of me knew this mind control idea was crazy, and said to tell him and either he would get it over with and kill me or it's not real. So after a while of us in bed together and me talking like a crazy person terrified to be hugged by my own husband, he finally half convinced me it wasn't real and I let him hug me until I fell asleep. 

The next day I called out of work again because I couldn't stop crying. I just kept thinking about how scary it was that I can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality. I've had this before, where I kinda get lost in my head and can't tell what's what, but it lasts for seconds, minutes if I'm high, but this was the first time I went so deep I actually believed it without immediately snapping back, if that makes sense (I guess kind of like an intrusive thought, but most of the time you snap back almost right away. I tend to dwell on them a bit, but this one I just couldn't pull myself out of.)

One other thing is that before this episode, I'd begun thinking of my depression, ADHD, and rational mind as all different types of thought in my brain, like different personalities, but not in like a scary way. It just helped to differentiate myself from my negative thoughts, so that when I was feeling ugly or like a failure that day, I could tell myself ""that is depression telling you you're not worthy, you have a sexy ass and you're a good mom overcoming difficulties!""  At first it was great for my self-esteem, but then here comes the intrusive thoughts again. I thought what if there actually are other consciousnesses living in my head, and they're all fighting to be the one in control, and I'm here all rational minding my own business in the back of brain here, barely able to see up front and can't get through the others. I think this thought was the catalyst for the idea that my husband could also control my mind. 

Oh, one more piece of relevant information. I hadn't liked the strattera anyway since I wasn't seeing ANY results in the 3 weeks of taking it (I know that isn't long enough for it to work, but typically you at least have side effects, so I got it in my head that it just wasn't registering with anything in my body), so when I had realized I was missing entire doses, I decided to just not take it at all and risk the withdrawal before discussing trying it again with my doctor.  I'm sure the sudden withdrawal did have some effect on me.

My brain has just been a shit storm since. The withdrawal, the beers, the pot, the overwhelming happy reunion with husband, it was all a perfect storm for depression to come back. But it also brought a lot of anxiety too (a new ""personality"").  I'm constantly stuck either in agitation or half-stuck in some dream world since the episode with my husband. 

Yesterday I woke up feeling really good and clear minded, had a lot of focus and felt somewhat productive, accidentally did a lot of shopping but got a lot done haha. Today I'm in the dumps and haven't really left my couch much. I have all these thoughts going through my head - bipolar, schizoaffective, dissociative disorder, more depression, hypochondria, nothing at all. Mostly it's just agitation today - everything is too loud and too bright and too distracting. 

My next psych appointment isn't for another 2 weeks but I can't wait to adjust meds to get me out of this weird depression and something else state. My problem is I never know what is important to tell the doctor and what's not, and I want to be as accurate as I can with her to avoid another crash like this. Any help there is appreciated!",1,
"This morning at 11 AM I took a 10mg Strattera, a second try at it after a bad reaction from the combination of this and Prozac two weeks ago.

"Hello everyone,

Recently I have been worrying about developing Schizophrenia. It has been getting better, but for the last week, I would say it has come back. Mainly from reading about it as part of my exposure response therapy, I have developed the fear again and some recent events have made me worried.

One, I am getting this word repeated in my head, ""Worthless"" over and over again. It is in my voice, but it is a voice that i did some voice acting for. Basically it is my voice, but in a more child manner (I do voice acting) as a hobby. This has made afraid because I fear it could be a sign of Schizophrenia. I got it after reading a reddit post where a person felt they were worthless on Sunday, but it went away when I got distracted. I made a reddit post about it a few days ago and I remembered it this morning, and now I keep getting the word repeated in my head over and over. Even when I am thinking another thought, I get the word ""Worthless"" in that voice over and over. I am scared of the thought and I am on edge about it, making sure that I don't think it all of a sudden. Is this a sign of Schizophrenia? I keep telling myself my brain is producing in response to my anxiety, but now I am wondering if it is real. This voice is internal, and it is of me, but today I was reading other words in the same voice in my head, so now I am wondering if this

Second, I am worried about some intrusive thoughts that sound delusional in nature. I was thinking when i started wondering ""What if someone is reading my mind"". After that, i went to myself - No one can do that, if they could, they would react when I said a bad thought about them. But it didn't feel convincing and I felt anxious about it. But later, I realize that the idea of people reading your mind or your thoughts being broadcasted is stupid.

I am currently on Strattera 50mg, which my psycharist said was suppose to help me for my ADHD and Anxiety, it is helping for my adhd and has no real side effects - but I am feeling anxious again but i am wondering if this is a side effect. When I was on the 25mg, I felt great, I then went on the 40mg and it was good again and then I got scared again and I started 50mg yesterday.

Should I be worried about Schizophrenia?",1,
"I was diagnosed ADHD about 15 years ago, and prescribed Ritalin for several years. It was very effective, but I was also a serious alcoholic. I went to treatment 6 years ago and haven't drank since,  but my EHR probably indicates that I've been in treatment for alcohol abuse.

I've tried strattera and CBT to help with my job, but it didn't help much. I ended up quitting a programming job after about 9 months, because it was just too stressful and hard to stay on task. My boss convinced me to come back, and I worked there for another year, but it was extremely hard to get through. I wore down more every week, and it was just impossible to keep going.

I initially told my psychiatrist I didn't want to try Ritalin again, and he never brought it up. But now I'm willing to try it again, because it was very effective in helping me get through college. However, I don't know if it can be prescribed to people with a history of addiction, and I feel like asking about it might make him inclined not to prescribe it. Is it realistic that someone in my position can be prescribed Ritalin?",1,
"Hello reddit,

I am not human anymore. That's how I feel at least.

To begin this thread off, I am a 17 year old male from Japan and I've been diagnosed with ADD a few months ago and been taking Strattera ever since, about 60mg a day. I am 1,8m tall and weigh about 60kg. I also was on Anafranil to treat depression until about two weeks ago, when I got fed up not being able to have sex. I knew about the possible withdrawal symptoms, however I was only being medicated on anafranil for four weeks. 

Due to the problems with ADD I switched from grammar school to technical secondary school, if anyone can relate to this. My new class is pretty chill, I really am interested in the subjects we're taking and am not sleeping during lessons anymore (might be due to not being on Anafranil anymore). I participate during lessons and am very confident in my current school progress.

However I am having problems coping with anger. This used to be an issue in the past before I was diagnosed with ADD and put on medication. I would argue and scream at my mother for hours because she would tell me to study more, even though I was already doing the best I can. 

The issue is that even that I am put on strattera (which by the way doesn't help me concentrate but instead makes me not forget stuff or as said, more calm), I am now dealing with more anger than I've ever had. I hate everything, even questions my own girlfriend of seven months asks me can make me go all rage mode.

Recently I lost my wallet in the school bus, in which I've had my fake ID. I got pissed for having the inconvenience of not only being unable to buy alcohol, but also probably facing uncomfortable confrontation by the head teacher. This though alone made me break a hole into the wall, break my mouse, my watch and get my whole room looking fucked up.. 

This scares myself, as I am i.e. talking to my girlfriend, getting more and more angry and realizing that I am hurting her and even though I love her once I am starting to get myself pissed off I cannot stop the rant anymore.

I feel like my own personality is bad. My own will is always too weak to go through with anything. I couldn't make myself learn more than 15 minutes per day (although I now kind of blame ADD, but I guess I'm just saying it as an excuse). I can't stop smoking even though I don't smoke too much. I can't not masturbate for more than half a day. I can't stop experimenting with drugs, especially dissociatives. I have written down a lot of my thoughts about why I am the way I am, or what I think why others are the way they are. I can't read a school lecture for more than five minutes but can read through erowid for four hours straight. I have a guy I used to trip with together and those are the only memories that I like. Sharing the same, fucked up feeling. Just two of us in the middle of Tokyo, aliens to everyone else. 

I have a lot of friends but I can't text any of them, I cannot keep a conversation really going. I am a nostalgic person and could look at pictures of my ex or my old ""online gaming friend"" screenshots of us playing i.e. Need for speed world and just keep crying. I really have a problem with depression but I don't want to be unable to have sex or masturbate. I feel insecure about my genitalia size. 

I usually make a joke out of myself in front of others and share edgy memes, to seem like the funny guy. I feel like I am doing all this to just cover up my insecure myself and have a protective shell around me. The ""no one can really hurt me, cause I am a living joke anyway"" kind of mindset.. I joke about me and my ex, and lately I feel like it's getting up to me and whereas I used to joke about crying myself to sleep because of my ex, now it's the truth. I don't want to die but I don't want to be myself anymore. But then, to change I'd need a stronger will.


Edit1: Not even sure if I have ADD or maybe BPD or whatever crazy ass combination, I just have mood swings like crazy, forget my shit, feel like having responsibilities are stupid (why the fuck go work, come home, barely have fun and go to work/school again?), cant concentrate for shit, feel like im experiencing reality slower than everyone else, I need to get lots of attention, my gf has issues with my temper and i have insecurities that I could win a tournament if there was one for who the biggest mental wreck is. If I wasn't too pussy to go through I'd be dead already. 
Changed my psychatrist (the guy who i talk to and gives me the meds) once already, as the one before wanted to get me on way too many meds, and my current one doesn't take my issues serious enough imo.

Also reddit makes me even more insecure cause i get ignored like crazy, whilst others get so much attention it's literally making me even more sad.

"Short Background: Diagnosed in my early teens, medicated on and off. Stimulants don't do well with me and I hate the 'crash' later in the day - I also just feel like a tired zombie. From age 24-30 unmedicated. 

I am 31 now and started Strattera a few months ago at 20MG for two weeks, then raised to 40MG (I had terrible side effects on this dose - Major headache - but it went away after a few days. 

Doc raised to 60 MG - my side effects were weird at this one - I was always hot and sweating. I had to lower my AC just to feel comfortable. 

A few weeks ago he raised it again to 80 MG since I didn't see much benefit from 60MG compared to the lower doses and I must say.. WOW. The side effect of being hot completely went away after a couple days. This dose is where it actually seemed to sneakily kick in. 

I feel like I can focus on things now. I even completed two of my school tasks within one day I've been procrastinating weeks for. My mind finally feels calm and just normal. I'm sleeping well with no racing thoughts. My husband has even remarked I have been way less irritated outbursts, and I'm remembering to do things...

So I know Strattera has a lot of hate, but just wanted to say I am having a lot of success with it, literally life changing. In case it matters, I AM diagnosed also with depression, so I had a prescription for 10MG Lexapro before the Strattera.

TL;DR: Strattera good when it works.",1,
"I was diagnosed with ADD about 2 months ago. My doctor prescribed concerta 36mg. It worked good but not the best thing in the world. I told my doctor that. She prescribed me straight 40mg Strattera. I’ve been on Strattera for 6 days  and I feel like shit. I can’t do anything I just lay down and sleep all the time. I cant really focus. I have zero motivation. I have chest pain and palpitations which they are scaring me to death. I can’t really continue on Strattera. I know it takes time to kick in but I feel I can’t really put up with the side effects. Should I stop it, Has anyone experienced this severe side effects then it worked out later? I saw people took them months living in these side effects until finally realized it is not working for them then decided to stop it.",1,"chest pain, palpitations"
"I really want this to work - my psychiatrist gave me the choice between stimulants and non-stimulants. My mother asked me to try Strattera first and I agreed because I like the idea of the medication lasting 24 hours. 

It’s my second day… I had it at night yesterday because I heard it makes you drowsy, and it was awful. I went to bed at 10 and woke up at 3. My sleep was so fragmented and my dreams were so vivid, I thought I woke up multiple times during the night even though I was actually asleep the whole time, and in my dreams I convinced myself that the meds had given me psychosis. To avoid the bad sleep, I decided to take it midday today and ended up napping for two hours, which was even worse because I woke up feeling so drained. My ADHD symptoms have been so much worse than usual because the meds have affected the tiny sliver of motivation I did have.

Also, I have insane dry mouth. I know it’s only my second day lol but I’m driving myself crazy reading people’s experiences with Strattera. A lot of people say it never ends up being particularly effective. Am i just gonna suffer for nothing? I’d love to hear success stories. Did the side effects ever go away? Or should I hit up my psychiatrist and tell her I changed my mind?",1,"d, dry mouth"
"I'll make this post super simple as I understand long posts lose alot of us.

I'm 29/M

I've carried anxiety on my back for as long as I can remember.  Ive been on SSRIS for 10+ years but despite it helping me a bit, my scattered thoughts never calmed down. I always thought ADHD was was a term people use for a hyper child, but subsides as you get older and it stops there. Oh how I was wrong. I always felt I was just an anxious person with many ocd triggering thoughts and always being on the verge of a panic attack. realized my whole life Id shy away from certain projects and learning new things at work because I cannot retain information worth anything. I easily get impulsive on little things.  I never had good productivity at work as I'd get distracted way too easily and put off work until the last 2 hours and get cram a brunch in.  I'll talk to someone and 99% of the time when I look at them while they talk, i cannot bring myself to actually listen.  It's affected my relationship with my 1 year old daughter as I was hoping to be a lot more present with her and my wife, but my brain cannot be in the moment. It saddened me because despite being a very affectionate father, I knowfeel like I'm missing out.

Fast forward to a few days ago. I took the plunge and tried Vyvanse. Immediately. When I say immediately.

My anxiously wired brain with 50 open tabs per minute diminished to FOCUSING ON ONE THING AT A TIME. My tiny brain was unable to understand how that was even possible...  did not think about ANYTHING other then... What I was presently doing. And my brain would not let me get distracted. It was bonkers. I had my first deep conversation with my wife in who knows how long the other morning at breakfast My daughter was sitting in her high chair and I was so interested in her every gesture. I paid more attention to her at breakfast than the 5 months I had on parental leave with her.  It's crazy how ADHD can impact your life in a negative way. Another major improvement was simply my focus and alertness. I sat at work for 8 hours at the office today and was so determined to work. I was actually interested and would never get distracted by coworkers chatting around me.

Most importantly - I actually put off trying Vyvanse for 5 months because I was terrified of taking it and driving me right into a panic attack as I do not like any mind altering substances. Boy was I wrong. For the first time in my life - my extremely anxious brain has become focused, with absolutely zero feeling of anxiety. Why hasn't the SSRIS doctors pushed on me for long had the same effect? Funny how things are.

I did connect the dots. 
I was  the most hyper kid growing up. My siblings laugh about it when they recall some moments. I was the craziest. I'd be bouncing on the couch hours on end. 

So maybe being so hyper as a kid switched as I got older and now that I do not have all that energy to be so hyper, my wired brain stayed the same as when I was a little young.

******FOLLOW UP AFTER WRITING MY POST*********

I am FLOORED. I thought I'd maybe have about 5 people have the same vibe from their anxiety being diminished greatly when starting Vyvanse. Thanks everyone for such the kind words. It really makes me smile to see so many people feeling the way I do and enjoying being clearminded. I must add a few other points I've noticed improvement on :

-Less impulsive. I used to get ticked off at the smallest things.

-More self confidence. I no longer feel jealous of people who walk by me and have their head up real high as ive always felt like I lacked confidence.

-No more social anxiety. I used to be so nervous having to go into certain public places, gatherings. This is greatly subsided.

-I am GENUINELY interested in people. As in, I used to never pay much attention to what people had to say due to my ADHD and now I am so involved in 1 on 1 conversations. 

- Not sure if it's dopamine boosting, but I feel a little head rush of happiness much more than I ever had. I'm guinenly happier.

-I no longer get distracted at my desk job.

-I show more affection to my wife and daughter.

- I used to worry about the stresses of future bills and overthinking... Now, I don't even give a shit. When the bill is due, I will have already set it in my calendar to pay it on time.

-My brain no longer gets anxiety. As in, I used to work myself up with some health anxiety... ""Is the food I just ate gone bad?"" ""Will I be I'll?"" ""My chest hurts. I hope my oxygen is okay""... ""Is my wife gonna make it home safe or will there be a car accident""? ""I'm terrified of the day my parents pass away"". ""I'm worried of having a stroke"". ""Do I have fatty liver""? ""I'm out of breath so easily"".... 

When I say shit like that LIVED in my brain all day, plus not being in the moment and focusing on life, I truly mean it.

It makes a week and I have absolutely not given a F**k about any of those things. Because I'm rationalising now. My anxiety is 0.

I’m 25M, 164 lbs, and on 40 mg of Strattera for two weeks now, and I feel hella oblivious, unmotivated and tired. Is this a normal side effect and does it go away? 

I’m searching for a new job and the inability to hype myself up and to focus is really starting to make me sad. I still take my usual 17.5 mg of Ritalin on top of it 3x a day, but I can’t see that having anything to do with it, on the contrary, right?",1,unmotivated
"I started strattera last Friday. It caused me to have intense dreams, except when I woke up I was stuck in the same state. It started two days ago, I woke up dizzy and confused. I accidentally ended up scraping my car on a large curb, but I believed it was from a lack of sleep.

Yesterday, I felt extremely tired and took a nap midday. I had a dream an invisible lizard person was hunting me. When I woke up I couldn't tell if I was awake. I was convinced he was still hunting me. I told my Mom that I was losing my sanity and called my Dad and Indian Health Services. Apparently I was babbling the whole time and randomly crying. I still have gaps in my memory and am still unsure what was real or not. After consulting IHS they told me to go to the ER immediately. The entire time I kept shaking my head and slapping myself to wake up. The lizard man was after me, and every sound and touch was him coming to kill me.

The doctors basically put me on an IV drip and ran blood tests. After four hours my sanity, sense of reality, and balance came back to me. This has by far been the worst experience with a prescribed medication I have ever had. Even now if I go back to sleep I will wake up in that same state again. 

Unsurprisingly I will never take Strattera ever again. If you take this medicine and end up feeling insane, stop taking it immediately and go to the hospital. It's dangerous!!! In one of my dreams I jumped off a building to wake myself up, it didn't work. Thankfully I didn't try that when I was actually awake!",1,
"Hi, this is my first time trying medication for ADHD. 20 min after taking 40mg of Strattera I vomited, and I still feel sick/tingling all over, and anxious-- probably anxious because this is unexpected. I've never had such an adverse reaction to any medication I've ever taken, and I feel pretty discouraged. 

Has this happened to you? Do you keep trying a medication if that is your initial reaction to it?

"Hello, I've been prescribed Strattera/amoxetine from my doctor as my first medicine to try and treat my ADHD. Originally, when I first got the medication, I took it for three days and realized (tmi) that I hadn't gone #2 in those three days, and the second and third day, I couldn't sleep for over 3/4 hours (I'm used to getting a good 7/8 hours!)

My sleep schedule has gotten pretty good the past month or two prior to the Strattera and I didn't want to mess it up, so I stopped taking it for two days to see if it was the Strattera or not. It ended up being the Strattera, because I used the bathroom as normal and slept the same as I used to prior to the medicine. I also take 300mg WellbutrinXL, this medication has never affected my sleep and works well for my depression, but not my ADHD.

I decided to keep taking it to see if these side effects would wear off, but my digestive system is still pretty bad (in the sense that it doesnt happen a lot) and my insomnia is also still pretty bad. 

I've been reading a bit about stimulant ADHD medications and wanted to ask for experiences regarding immediate release medications. I only really need to manage my ADHD when I'm at work (9-5 half of the week) and when I'm doing my college studies, as it's hard to focus. Otherwise, I don't mind that my executive functions may be a little out of wack when I'm not working/studying. 

Would immediate release medications be something worth trying? I'm a bit wary just because I've read that there's a crash to it, and I don't want to feel like crap every day after the medication wears off—but I'd love to hear everyone's experience. I think, specifically, it'd be great to hear some stories about immediate release (or even extended) medications with 1) the effect on your sleep 2) the crash, if you experience one",1,
"So my doctor wants to start me on Strattera. I was wondering who has been on this and what side effects I should expect? The good and the bad, Im.a women in my 30s who just got diagnosed with ADHD and want to know what you all have experienced while on it before I start anything. 

Are there any questions I should ask my doctor regarding the drug or are their better alternatives? I know all medications work differently with everyone but I figured I should ask before my next appointment.

"So on Monday I had my first consultation with a PNP with my dad and she asked me the standard ADHD questions.

I answered ""Every day"" for all but two of them and she basically said ""Yeah you *show signs* of ADHD (basically never confirming it)
But she then she was ABOUT TO PERSCRIBE ME RITALIN-

The only reason she didn't is cause the site that I found her off of (telehealth appointment) lied and said she was licensed in my state (she was not) and she was just as confused as we were.

So as an alternative she gave me a prescription for Strattera (month trial) while she looks for a psych licensed in my state.

My question is... huh??? It thought you had to be tested for weeks or months but right out the gate she was about to give me stimulants.
She never even officially waved her hand and said ""yeah you have it"".

I just took my first pill of Strettera, but I'm still a bit frustrated because the effects take weeks to kick in, and I've been struggling a LOT. 

My questions are:

1. What the hell just happened?

2. What should I expect with Stattera? (Aside from the pill info on the damn bottle)

"So.. just wanted to reach out and see if anyone else experienced this, or if it's unrelated to Strattera. So, about 2 months ago I was prescribed Strattera and began at 10 mg and worked up to 40. I had many extremely unpleasant side effects (mostly mood/energy related) which factored into me weaning off of it about a month ago. Two of those side effects were intense dizzy spells and blurred vision/difficulty focusing my eyes. All my other side effects went away when I stopped taking the medication, but these have lingered and I'm becoming concerned as they somewhat affect my ability to function. Has anyone else on Strattera noticed this, particularly after you stopped taking the medication? Did it go away at any point? ",1,"intense dizzy spells, blurred vision, difficulty focusing my eyes"
"I was apprehensive about trying any ADHD drugs at all but after really pushing myself to address my severe ADHD, I took the plunge and the doctor got me on Strattera. I am male.

Note: I do not take any other medication.

I have used Strattera at a lower dose of 25mg for 3 weeks now. The doctor suggested staying at a low dose due to my very sensitive body and seeing how I react.

The pros:

- I've noticed my anxiety has subsided dramatically. I am way more calm and emotionally regulated.

- The ""mental noise"" in my head has died down a lot. I have some peace to think and direct my thoughts more effectively.

- Increased (yet sporadic) ability to focus. It's like a ""slow burn"" if you will, where my mind goes ""why don't I just stay on task a little longer"" versus ""I MUST OPEN 50 RANDOM TABS AND GO ROCK CLIMBING"". However, it is not super consistent but this is subjective and also due to dosage probably.

- Neutral: no major effects on erectile quality or libido.

The cons:

- Urinary issues. This has died down since the first week but I've noticed strange aches and tensions in the area making it harder to urinate

- Increased mild depression. I am not sure how to word this but it has made my mild depression more constant. It's a strange one, but it isn't debilitating, spiraling depression? Again, YMMV, this is my subjective experience.

- Slightly increased heart rate, but that's seemed to have gone down.

And, by a country mile the WORST side effects of them all:

- Insomnia. I have not had a single good night's sleep in the month of October. I have tried adjusting the timing of the dosage from mornings, mid day to evenings to no avail. This is frankly intolerable, I used to sleep fine before.

- Severe fatigue. This has gotten better since the first week, but does it even matter?

I will be consulting my doctor today, who has been helpful, for suggestions. I cannot tolerate the insomnia. 

What is your experience? Does it get better?",1,depression
"I started treatment for my ADHD back in November. The first drug that my doctor had prescribed with Strattera which most of you guys know is a non-stimulant medication for ADHD. For me, it made me nauseous and my appetite very quickly diminished to nothing. Whenever I had the nausea I would also take a nap for 3 hours. My doctor and I decided that Strattera wasn't the solution and now I am using Vyvanse which has been great. I was on Strattera for 2 or 3 months before switching to Vyvanse.

  
I'm just wondering if Strattera works for anyone. I know that the symptoms that I experienced are common for most people. Or is it just a starter for people who are seeking treatment for ADHD to fulfill insurance requirements and to try and keep patients from having the stimulant medication in case this one does work?",1,"nauseous, nausea"
"yesterday i started taking strattera, and i'm curious if what i'm experiencing are side effects. when i took it yesterday, at first i felt steady and my mind stopped racing, but later on, i began to feel super drowsy and feverishly warm. at bed time i was exhausted but could not get to sleep and once i did, i woke up a couple times during the night. i woke up this morning in a cold sweat and i am still quite sleepy this afternoon. i am taking fluoxetine alongside strattera, and i have been for a while. are these effects common or should i be worried?",1,"super drowsy, feverishly warm"

"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD at 34 years old. My doctor prescribed 40mg Strattera to get me started and I’ve already noticed a difference just 1 week in. I feel like I’m no longer a victim to a racing tornado of thoughts and can actually focus on something for an extended period of time. I am SO hopeful for continuing on and reaping the full benefits. 

But the biggest issue I have is my sleep has absolutely crumbled. I’ve never had issues getting or staying asleep, but for the past week, I’ve had major insomnia. Waking up at least 3-5x each night, having trouble getting back to sleep. I usually sleep 7-9 hours each night, and this last week have been lucky if I get 5 or 6. I use an Oura ring to track my sleep and my scores have been awful. Melatonin hasn’t helped me either. 

My heart rate has also increased using Strattera which I think is part of the issue. I exercise regularly, I eat well, I have 1 cup of coffee in the morning, I don’t look at blue light or screens before bed, I drink chamomile tea, I sleep in a pitch black, cold AF room with a sound machine… I do all the things right, but I miss my sleep! 

I know they say to take the medication for a few weeks to get adjusted so I’m going to stick it out for a couple months, but wanted to ask if anyone has dealt with something like this before and if so, when your sleep quality began to normalize again??

"Hi all! I was recently diagnosed- last wed. to be exact. I was prescribed to Strattera 40mg to try. I took it the very next morning. First day i was so tired it felt like i took sleeping pills. I had to sleep i couldn’t stay awake. Since then it was intense nausea the next two days, and no appetite at all each day so far (today makes 4 days)

I know it’s still super early since starting them. But i have went the entire day not hungry what so ever and the smell of certain foods make me want to throw up and the thought of eating is the farthest thing from what i want to do. 

I am not nauseous today i just can’t eat. If you’ve had these side effects to start do they ever go away? I’m forcing myself to eat because it’s effecting my BP and in like seeing stars and close to blacking out.

"Got prescribed Strattera 2 years ago, after being on ritalin for one year(it made me too hyperactive) At first i thought i was getting used to it but s year later now i search up the side effects and it literally matches my experiences, but it still gives me no energy at all.

"So I’ve heard for some that straterra increases your heart rate and blood pressure. I was apprehensive of this because my physician put me on straterra since Ritalin started giving me chest pains (it didn’t do that the first year I took it and worked perfectly, still not sure why it started doing that but it happened around when I developed new allergies) . I have low blood pressure usually and I think something excaberated that to the point where taking stimulants/caffeine etc is too much of a sudden change and I’ll get chest pains. That’s only my theory though, I have yet to have any medical professional actually look into it and not brush over that change. I took straterra for the first time last night and it significantly slowed my heart rate down. I read about how it can affect the heart rate because of neopinephrine uptake or something, so I’m very curious as to if anyone else has experienced their heart rate slowing down instead of increasing.",1,"heart rate, blood pressure, chest pains, chest pains"
"So I was on a low dose of Strattera for about 2 years. Started at 25mg then up to 40 mg then back down to 25mg because I didn't feel I needed the 40mg. When I started it I was in a very, very hectic and stressful time of my life. Now, things are calmer and I see a therapist for ADHD. With the therapists help and having a calmer life, I felt it necessary to try life not medicated. But mostly wanted to stop because I was tired of side effects. Heart palpitations, and how it isn't good for the heart/liver, etc. A few others I can't think of at the moment. For me, I don't think the benefits outweighed the negatives anymore.

Sooo that brings me to my question! Those of you who have stopped Strattera, what positive benefits came from quitting the medication? I find that unless things are abrupt, I don't notice slow changes. Withdrawal was/is rough. I'm still within the first week of not taking it. 

I'd just like to know what side effects stopped, what felt better. Any positive effects from stopping the medication is welcome! 

Thanks! :)

"I (22 F) have been diagnosed with ADHD and it seems that stimulated medication have not been treating me well. I've been seeing a psychiatrist this year and so far he has put me on two stimulants: Adderall and Vyvanse.

Vyvanse: After Adderall, he put me on 30mg of Vyvanse. It was the same experience when I took Adderal. Dry mouth, loss of appetite, headaches.

Today, I had my follow-up appointment and my psychiatrist prescribed me Strattera. He's prescribing me with 25mg for a month. From what I know, Strattera is a non-stimulant.

I can fall asleep a tiny bit more faster now but my overall nothing has changed. I stay up every night till like 12 to 2 in the morning and wake up somewhere around 4 like clock work. I’m lucky if I can doze off for what only feels like a minute again. I then spend the rest of my day trying to get a nap in if I can but that’s usually been met in vain or with disappointment how terribly the quality is. I’m hesitant to go to sleep when I’m tired now cause I know I’ll wake up feeling more exhausted. Has anyone experienced something like this or know of anything like this? Will this last?? Any advice would be really appreciated 😅",1,frequent awakenings
"So I'm not sure that they still prescribe Strattera or not as it seems like Adderall is more prevalent nowadays. I was prescribed Strattera for a year when I was about 13 in 2003. So I guess it was kinda the new thing after Ritalin. Now my parents thought since I was a little hellion and couldn't multitask or pay attention in school they sought medical help like alot of parents did at the time. 

So here's my question. I'll share my experience with Strattera and hopefully you will share yours! Personally It's been so long since I took it I think it helped with focusing and not racing thoughts but my parents noticed a huge change in my personality. And I had these little quirks like scrunching up my toes so much that I wore holes in them. Actually all the way thru the padding and into the bottom of my shoe. They were worried about my personality change but when they saw my shoes they immediately stopped it. Honestly I think I was a really smart kid who read a lot, blow stuff up, ride dirt bikes and was bored in school. I probably have ADHD but they really just threw that word around in the early 2000s and loved to prescribe it to creative kids and day dreamers. Anyway. I still can't do two things at once, I forget where I put everything, and I don't know why but sometimes when someone asks me something I'll say huh? Even when I heard you but I was thinking about something else ever since I was a kid. So much so my parents thought I had hearing problems. Haha.  I dunno for me I guess the side effects were worse than just being a young boy! 

Would love to hear your experience with the drug and if it helped you and or you maybe had the same experience as I? ",1,
"I remember reading somewhere about someone who had the increase in medication and how it felt. I have to take Strattera at night or else I’m drowsy. Today I was fine, until I was in my car and felt stinging in my hands and feet. It was like I had ants on me. Not long afterwards, my blood pressure dropped. I’m really fuzzy feeling, which I know I’ve felt like this when I first started taking it during the day, but I took it last night. So I’m not sure if it’s actually my meds or if there’s something else wrong. Has anyone experienced this?",1,stinging
"I (F29) was diagnosed around 3 years ago. Had a horrible experience with concerta, would still feel the same, zero motivation, can't work, can't do anything before getting absolutely horrible anxiety so psychiatrist told me to stop and switched to Straterra.

Been on Straterra (with escitalopram) for seven months, it was pretty slow going (up to 60mg), no big changes at all for months, finally started feeling a bit better, slightly more motivated, but the bigger, more insurmountable issues that I have trouble with were still out of reach and my anxiety started to spike so Doc suggest wellbutrin with Straterra.

But then I just kind of stopped taking my pills altogether (I know, you shouldn't, but I just kind of forgot for a few days and then couldn't make myself take them anymore). After a horrible two weeks where my blood pressure would go down and I'd get super dizzy, terrible migraines, I started feeling better.

Suddenly I had motivation just to do the things I wanted (not work or hard stuff). I joined a million clubs, starting swimming again, thought to myself that it had all been a fluke, probably never had adhd, etc. But then, as you can guess, it all came crashing down. Zero motivation again, back to treading water.

I restarted the Strattera this week and have been miserable, first three days I spent them almost narcoleptic with tiredness, then nausea and not eating or sleeping well. And now the emotional mood swings ( had a crying breakdown today). 

My question is was the Strattera even working? I can't remember a lot of how I felt when I was taking it (I have horrible memory) but looking back could it have been a placebo effect? I see those posts where meds change people immediately and it makes me doubt even more? Should I ask to switch? What has been your experience with Strattera and after how many months does it feel like it's working?",1,##graines
"I am looking for some tips or what to expect while taking 

I got diagnosed yesterday and my Dr. and I agreed on Strattera (Atomoxetine) for my first meds in leu of Adderall to see how I do on a no stim med.  When I took it this morning it actually made me very very tired, and I felt like I was kind drunk and had this body throbbing. The feeling is akin to when I take Nyquil.  

Will these go away after a week or so?  I don't know if I could deal with that daily. Literally would be no point in taking it.   

One thing is for sure is you have to take it with food or a full stomach.  Also so far today, I haven't notices any real improvement in attention.    ",1,body throbbing
"I'm new to dealing with ADHD, even though I've had it since I was a kid. My dad always told me to just ""suck it up and deal with it."" Now that I'm in my early 30s, I decided it's time to start working on myself. I recently spoke with a doctor who confirmed I do have ADHD. She suggested starting with non-stimulant medication first and said we could try stimulants later if the non-stimulants don't work. However, she mentioned it would take months because I would need to go through a urine tests and pass that before stimulants could be prescribed. On top of that, there's a shortage of stimulants, so finding them could be difficult.

The doctor prescribed 40 mg of Strattera a day for now. But after I got home and started researching online, I gave myself anxiety about starting it, to the point where I feel nauseous. I travel a lot for work, especially next week, and I don't want to feel sick while I'm on the road. I'm also already on the skinny side, and this is the first time in my life that I've managed to gain 15 lbs. I really don't want to lose that progress.

I guess I'm just scared... but I really want to manage my ADHD. About a year ago, I got a glimpse of what it feels like to have my ADHD under control, and it was an amazing experience—I accomplished so much and felt really proud of myself. I’m just anxious and looking for advice. I want to try the medication today but agreed to maybe wait until the weekend, though I'm worried the side effects will still affect me into next week.",1,adhd
"Hi everyone. I’m currently on day 3 of taking Strattera. I have been experiencing some side effects, which i guess is normal but it’s very annoying because I’m supposed to be studying but it’s really interfering with that. I’m exhausted, I’m nauseous, i get headaches, i constantly feel both hot and cold at the same time, i’m very emotional and i just generally feel kinda weird. My psychiatrist said that if i experienced bad side effects i could call her and then she’d consider starting me on stimulants. But i’m not sure if these side effects are bad enough though. I feel like she’ll just tell me to stick it out and that they’ll go away with time and that i need to take it longer and need to give it a chance. 

I don’t really know what to do, because i really can’t afford to fail those exams. But i feel like she’ll just tell me I’m overreacting.",1,"nauseous, headaches"
"For anyone who takes or has taken strattera and upped their dose too much and found it worked better at a lower dose, please share your experience.

My doctor upped my dose at a rate of every two weeks so it's hard for me to tell how it impacted me. But that was my fault as I wanted to rush to the recommended 80mg. 

I've been feeling extremely irritable lately though and I'm wondering if it could mean the dose is too high or if it's something completely unrelated. When I first started on the medication, I felt much less irritible and felt that way for the first month but now I'm feeling really moody.",1,"irritable, irritible, moody"
"Anyone have experience taking these two together? My current dr does not want to combine the two as she states that they would have opposing effects on norepinephrine. Yet, I was given Qelbree to try instead but this is also an SNRI?? 

Clonidine was my suggestion after stimulants were too much on my heart rate. I find the Clonidine alone does amazing things for the hyperactive side and my sleep is outstanding again. Strattera was by far the best anti anxiety I've ever taken and was the only one to knock it out completely and vastly improved my energy levels. I stopped Strattera mainly due to high heart rate but I had figured taking clonidine alongside strattera would settle that out. 

My suggestion was to keep with the .1 x2 daily Clonidine and reintroduce a small dosage of Strattera after waking. I'm extremely sensitive to all medications so typically I'm good with starting doses (sometimes even less!) 

Is she correct that one cannot do that?

  
Btw, qelbree was promising at just 100mg dose but made me smell like spoiled milk and chemicals. Which I have read does that to some people. Smelled the pellets and that's exactly what qelbree smells like! Can't have that, lol. ",1,##epine
"I finally decided to go get help, I’m a young female with hand tattoos, not that it matters but I think it might.

I have no energy, I’m seeing things out of the corner of my eye, my anxiety is through the ROOOOOF!! Me and my fiance are struggling because everything he does since I started this has been pissing me off.

"I started Strattera two weeks ago, 20 mg week one, then bumped up to 40 mg in week two. *Modest* improvements in fidgeting/overall hyperactivity (feeling pretty good about that as I know it takes a while for the meds to build up). Hoping eventually for greater concentration and willpower at work. Fairly significant headaches, nausea, general discomfort days 1 and 2, mostly subsided since. Also noticed elevated heart rate which lasted a little longer. Still noticing reduced appetite, although it's come back somewhat over the past 2-3 days. 

  
This is my first time back on meds in about twenty years, took mostly Adderall and Ritalin elementary-high school. Stopped on my own because I felt it never did much for me other than unwanted side effect of generally feeling ""medicated"", although on all the objective measures (school psychologist testing, etc.) meds helped. Picked Strattera because I was looking for nonstimulant treatment, although tbh some of these side effects remind me of Adderall.  

  
The plan is for me to stick with 40 mg for the next four weeks and then check in with the psychiatrist. From what I've read, 80 mg is the target, guessing I'll stick it out for the next few weeks, bump up the dose and then re-evaluate a few weeks after that--might just opt for stimulants again but I know there are other nonstims out there.

Several docs later, nobody is willing to prescribe Adderall again. I don't know why, I have never had any compulsion to overmedicate and my only addiction is coffee.

Before I start cooking my own D-amp (I'm *that* desparate to get my life back), I am giving Strattera a try.

I hate that Adderall fixes me in 20 minutes but I'll have to wait weeks to see if Strattera works.

"I took my first dose of 40mg of Strattera back on the 29th. It took a few days for the effects to set in and for the side effects to wear off, but things were going well by the second week. I was able to do things like exercise without feeling any sort of resistance, and it became much easier to maintain focus when working. 

But for some reason, it's been losing its effectiveness over this third week. It started back around the 7th with an increase in distractibility, but it's since worsened to the point that forcing my brain to concentrate causes physical pain in the form of a headache that can take up to an hour to wear off once I try resting. I tried doing my stretches and exercises this morning, and my body just physically froze at several points when I was switching between different stretches or exercises. The 30 minutes of stretches took closer to 55, and by the end of it all, I was feeling sorer and more exhausted from trying to focus on it all than I was from the actual exercise.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? And if so, what became of it?",1,distractibility
"I take Vyvanse (70mg) and prozac (30mg). Decided to try adding strattera because my coworker who also had ADHD recommended it and takes a similar combination. I am on the highest dose of vyvanse and I love it, but I definitely still can lose focus on stuff. 

Holy hell, somehow 10mg of strattera is fucking me up badly. I think I was in denial at first because it does help my focus a lot, but it is making me feel like a mess. My psychiatrist tried me on a low dosage since there is an interaction with prozac, man... why is it doing this? I tried to wait it out and stuff, but it literally feels like it negates the prozac entirely. I want to eat all the time even though the vyvanse and prozac kill my feeling hungry. So i basically am back to just wanting to binge for the sake of binging/tasting the food. I'm getting the intrusive thoughts I had before prozac. I feel randomly sad.

"I was diagnosed with ADHD earlier this year and since then my doctor and I have been trying a few meds.

** I was on Prozac for 2 years prior to the diagnosis because I have bad anxiety. 
The diagnosis determined that most of my anxiety comes from the adhd.

I didn’t want to switch to stimulants right away because I would have to quit the Prozac so we tried Wellbutrin for a week and I had the most horrible sleep I’ve ever had in my entire life. 

So we tried Guanfacine for about a month but that did absolutely nothing for me. 

Then we moved on to strattera 18mg and I started feeling more focused, had a bit more energy and an easier time with task initiation and it felt like we’re on the right track. But then we moved on to 25mg and my anxiety went through the roof and I started to have a lot of trouble sleeping so we stopped the strattera altogether. 

Finally she prescribed be Ritalin 18mg which is the minimum dose and I actually felt pretty good, but I couldn’t fall asleep all night. 
Like not a single minute of sleep. 

I tried meditation, audiobooks, boring game apps, melatonin, but nothing worked.

"TLDR; switching from max dose (60mg) of Adderall to 80mg Strattera. How do these medications differ? How does the dosing compare between them?

I have been taking 60mg of generic Adderall (extended release) every morning for the past two years. However, I just moved to a new state and subsequently have to find a new psychiatrist before I can be prescribed Adderall again. I was advised to meet with a tele-health doctor who could give me a referral for a psychiatrist and also prescribe me something else in the meantime. To my surprise, that actually worked out and he prescribed me 80mg of Strattera to take in the morning (two 40mg capsules). 

However, it’s my understanding that Strattera is a non-stimulant medication and is therefore less effective than Adderall. I’ve also read that (for some people) it takes 4 weeks for it start becoming effective at all. Is this true? Can anyone speak on the differences between these medications? Or how quickly you began to feel the effect of Strattera? How dosing of Adderall compares to Strattera (mg wise)?

"Hi all, I’ve been curious about others’ experiences on Strattera. I’ve been reading some of the old posts here and in other subreddits. 

I’ve been taking Strattera 10 mg (and also struggling to take it regularly which is a whole other thing…thanks ADHD). 

Most posts I’ve read say 10 mg didn’t really do anything for them. However- I think because I’ve been known to always be extremely sensitive to most medications I get a pretty decent energizing effect from the Strattera- I often feel it kick in roughly 30-45 ish mins from taking it too. Feeling “buzzy”, extra warm/sweaty, more of a dry mouth, etc. Have others felt this effect at this low of a dose? Not sure if it’s because of my body type/stature or if it’s more of a genetics thing. 

Not complaining too much because the effect does give me a sort of motivation and focus to initiate and complete tasks (which are the hardest for me to do), but if I’m already anxious or stressed the Strattera definitely magnifies that and I hate that feeling- anyone else also kinda avoid taking their meds when they already feel anxious, knowing that it’ll make it worse?

It's hard to explain but it feels like my body is trying to amp me up to do something, but I'm just sitting there not needing to do anything.

I've been on 40mg strattera for less than two months now and I've noticed that in the last two weeks I cum really fast compared to before and it kinda doesn't feel as good. But my pleasure isn't the concern here because the drug is already helping me with my ADHD (other efficient ADHD drugs like ritalin are really expensive here and I can't efford them) and I'm happy with it. I mean I can always go for next rounds and I always make sure to make her cum too, but it's been fucking with my head so much nonetheless. I've asked her and she says she's okay with it and she's enjoying our time either way, but I can't help but to overthink that I'm not giving her the same pleasure as before. On the off note, it's been harder for her to achieve orgasm recently. She's been stressed for a bunch of family reasons and her cycles have not been on the sync and she's gonna visit a doctor. And I don't know if her change in orgasms is because of some hormones or because of me.
I dunno what I should even ask. Do you guys think she's actually ok with it as long as I make her cum? Has anyone had similar experiences with strattera and does it get any better over time? Any way to make the situation better? Cuz I'm really considering to stop taking it.",1,
"My psychiatrist prescribed me 25mg of Strattera and I took it for 3 days (Sat, Sun, Mon of this week) as I was having really bad nausea and headaches. My psychiatrist told me to stop taking it and I have still been nauseous with headaches to this day since I stopped taking it on Tuesday.

Is this something that is possible even though I only took it for three days? Am I having an allergic reaction or did my body reject it? Was it too strong?

I’m really confused and would like some advice or to see if anyone had experienced this before as well 😭😭😭",1,"nausea, headaches, nauseous, headaches"
"I've been taking Straterra for a few months now. Starting with a dosage of 40 mg and now at a 60 mg dosage. Why I am on it is because I took Adderall in high school for two days and dropped it because I was feeling overwhelmed by a tingly sensation (especially in my brain). It has been 2 year now since then and I've dug through my medication and noticed that the Adderall I was prescribed as 30 mg of dextroamphetamine. I've looked online and it would seem that this is an unusually high starting dosage. Typically adults or children over the age of six start with 5 mg and build up over time. What do you guys think? Should I ask my healthcare provider for a switch up because I've unfairly given up on Adderall? Anyone with a similar experience to share? Personally I am comfortable with Straterra, but there is that itch telling me that Adderall may be even more effective.",1,tingly sensation
"I got prescribed 25mg of Strattera about 1.5 months ago and went up to 60mg \~10 days ago.  For the last two or three nights I've been getting awful dreams, like nightmares but no monsters or demons. Just dreams of really distressing arguments with my family and girlfriend that leave me upset in the morning. I've never had dreams like that, and they've happened every night for the last three nights. Apparently this is a known effect of Strattera, and so I'd like to get off it as I've also had no help with ADHD.

So my question is: how do I taper off Strattera? I have a leftover supply of 25mg, so could I be very aggressive and go down to 25/day for 1 week and then stop entirely? Or would I need to get some 10mgs and decrease every week or two from 60-25-10-0? I'd really like to get off it as soon as possible if these dreams are gonna continue--they're making me anxious to go to bed. So if an aggressive taper is possible I'd like to do it, and if there are mild withdrawal symptoms I can handle it as long as they aren't worse than getting a cold.",1,

"I have stopped Strattera now after a month of starting it, having had a dose of 40mg a day. It was a fantastic medication which I felt really helped, and its effectiveness was incredibly noticeable only after I had stopped taking it as I noticed just how much I declined with my symptoms when I didn’t take it anymore. 

I stopped due to stomach issues, drowsiness and one or two other side effects coupled with the fact I am worried about liver damage. That last part is a concern due to a blood test I had before starting the medication, as the test flagged up irregular result with my liver function but nothing serious. 

It has been 3 weeks now, I am scatty as never was, memory worse and in a way lost motivation. The more scary thing I have noticed is that I have a really short temper and my agitation and anxiety are a lot higher.

For those who have experienced the same, how long should this last??

Adderall XR was OK; I got some heart palpitations after 2 weeks that made me stop taking it. So today, I took my first dose of Strattera, which I understand to be a non-stimulant option. Within 20 minutes I was on my bed shaking back and forth and trying to catch my breath like I was about to have an anxiety attack. It caught me off guard and really freaked me out. I managed to get myself to relax a little bit and even slept for a half hour. I’m awake again now and I feel like absolute shit.

"Hi, friends!

I’m currently on strattera to manage my adhd symptoms and help with depression. I tried adderall before, but it worked for a while and then started making my anxiety worse. 

Strattera has improved my adhd symptoms somewhat.  I’ve been able to maintain the house better and be more engaged in conversations and things like that. 

But I also feel like it has made me more irritable and have less happy/excited periods of time. Like my low lows aren’t around as often, but I feel like I’m in a constant boring mellow, almost like I’m a robot. Normally when I’m not depressed I’m a pretty excitable-happy person. 

Has anyone else on strattera had experiences like this? Do you think it would be worth trying to switch?",1,mellow
"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. Due to being honest about drinking heavily in my early 20s (I was a bartender in New Orleans - who wouldn’t?) my doctor told me she won’t prescribe stimulants. I’m 31 now and only drink maybe 2-3 drinks every few weeks with friends… So I’m unsure why that even matters now.

Anyways, my doctor prescribed me 40mg of Strattera. Today is day 3 and it has been absolute hell. I have been more irritable than I’ve been in my life. I literally screamed at my husband yesterday during an argument and said some awful things. This is something I have never done before… I haven’t been able to keep my eyes open. My fatigue is even worse than it normally is which is taking an even bigger toll on executive dysfunction. I’m experiencing muscle weakness in both my arms and legs. I have a super loud ringing in my ears that won’t go away and it’s driving me crazy. I’m dizzy and can’t stand for long periods of time. I can’t eat or think straight. I’ve cried til my eyes burn. I’ve had really dark thoughts that I haven’t had in years. I have dry mouth constantly no matter how much water I drink and I can’t stop sweating. I have night sweats, sweats during the day and hot flashes. I had to change my shirt 3 times today alone. I can’t find joy in anything and I’m feeling either completely numb or an intense rage. My anxiety is through the roof!

I don’t know if I can take this for even another day. It’s driving me mad. I told my husband that I’m ready to check myself into a mental hospital that’s how bad it’s making me feel. 

I was hoping my doctor would prescribe me adderall since it has always worked wonders for me. Unfortunately I have only ever been able to buy it off friends. But it actually helped me function and feel almost normal. But again, they said they won’t prescribe it cause I was honest about drinking heavily in my 20s with friends. 

This is an absolute nightmare. Does it get better? I’ve been going to therapy 2x per week for depression, trauma, etc and honestly, ever since I started taking Strattera, it has made me feel worse than I’ve felt in years. It’s like all of my progress has gone completely away.",1,ad

"Apparently Strattera can cause both drowsiness during the day, and insomnia at night. I'm surprised, since usually it's one or the other with most drugs. Does anyone know what causes this or how it works? 

Background: I was recently prescribed 10mg Strattera twice a day, so I'm wondering what my best bet would be timing-wise to take both doses. Trying to avoid daytime drowsiness if possible. My doctor said I could take them whenever/timing doesn't matter, but from everyone I talk to, it seems like it does matter to most people. Based on other's experiences, it seems like I have these options: 1.) taking both 10 mg pills in the morning, 2.) taking one pill in the morning and one in the afternoon, or 3.) taking both pills at night.

"hi guys, i've been struggling to reach a conclusion on strattera. while i'm at work, i've noticed its made me more focused and able to organize tasks one by one; i'm also more motivated in general and i don't feel as negatively about things as i did before. its easier to ""think"" in a straight line, i guess.

however, i am so physically tired that i can barely bring myself to do the things i would like to do. it may be because it's messing with my sleep - i can hardly sleep more than 4-5 hours in a row - but most days i am laying in bed for at least a few hours, unable to do anything or get up. even after i nap i don't feel energized, i feel more on edge. 

i switched from taking it in the morning to taking it before bed due to other side effects and i'm wondering if this was the wrong choice for my sleep. i've only been taking strattera for 4 weeks but it's becoming unbearable. i'm laying in bed as i type this because i physically can't move to my desk. did anyone else slog through this and see results? does it get better in time? i really want strattera to be the one, especially because school is starting soon and i need to be able to focus",1,
"Almost at the 1 month mark here and waiting. It would be great, I don’t relish taking stims like my partner and new GP seem to think. But I’m not optimistic - there’s a reason it’s second line.

So far everything else has gotten  lot worse (just as I feared) but my motivation has improved somewhat. It’s never been my main issue but def room for improvement. That’s not considered a strong point of strattera so it’s probably just due to the season change/spring forward. 

Good luck but i’m soon to give up on it regardless of whether I can restore my adderall script. I was rushed through an intake and unable to express my fear that things would get worse, that it WAS working just enough to keep me on this side of the brink of personal or professional disaster. Turns out that’s probably true. 

Q for others - Would it be worth increasing my dose first? It’s already giving my dry mouth and I have a bad cavity that can’t be treated for another month. So I’m leaning no on the dose increase…",1,dry mouth
"It does *mostly* work for me, but it gives me bad nausea (so i tend to take it in the evening to avoid dry heaves or puking in meetings), and really bad insomnia brouht my secondary hypertension back resetting the clock before my doc will be willing to prescribe a stimulant, which is *super* frustrating because it was unmanaged ADHD causing the generalized anxiety which was pushing my blood pressure above normal in the first place.

When my adhd is managed and I am able to get enough sleep, my blood pressure is normal.

And, adderall and ritalin enable me to focus and ***actually*** *study* (if I know 80%-90% of the material for a course and need to study to get those remaining nuggets of knowledge for exams, my brain checks out), but strattera doesn't solve that problem. But, because of the anxiety and insomnia fueled secondary hypertension, I can't get a prescription for stimulants, even though we've conclusively concluded that my ADHD-induced anxiety is the primary cause of my blood pressure issues, and the insomnia from the wrong ADHD medication for my needs, but my doctor won't budge out of caution. :-(

I don't want stimulants either, really, but it's obvious to me that stimulants are the correct solution. The only drug I like is 420 - I don't drink alcohol to get drunk (I dislike being buzzed/drunk), but because I enjoy some drinks. I don't even care for caffeine - I'm happy with decaf coffee, and would rather have pepsi 0 caffeine free, if it existed.

So I'm caught in a conundrum preventing actually fully solving my ADHD struggles. Sigh.

My mother did me a huge disservice shrink-shopping to get a shrink to rule out ADHD. If she had accepted that my being all over the place interest-wise was actually an ADHD symptom, and that stimulants fixed it, I'd still be on ritalin or adderall today and would have avoided that 35+ year battle with anxiety that I went through.

In the past I took Bupropion - Wellbutrin XR 150. I found initially starting on it uncomfortable, and a little speedy, or like something was going to kick in but doesn't. I had minimal effects : positive or negative over the years so I switched off.  After starting an SSRI, Zoloft, I had male sexual dysfunction. I found reintroducing the SNRI Bupropion solved that.  I am curious how Strattera would interact with Bupropion but not knowledgeable on it.  I went off of both same time cold turkey with minimal discomfort.

- health history; are you on any medications, have you ever had a medical procedure done, have you previously been diagnosed with ADHD/ASD or another mental health condition, do you have any on going health conditions (depression, epilepsy, anemia...etc) and do you have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep

- family health history.  specifically does anyone in your family have history of stroke, seizure, heart attack, diabetes, ADHD/ASD, addiction, or mood disorders. 

- trauma history (if yes, explain - alcoholic parents, abusive relationship in my early 20s, etc)

- behaviors and adult feedback prior to age 12 (I was super disorganized, never did homework, adults were constantly frustrated by my ""potential"" and ""laziness"")

- behaviors and adult feedback through middle and high school (similar to childhood behavior)

- behavior in college (took me longer to graduate than most, over 4 years, missed class a lot, left studying to the last minute)

- social behavior (personal life) - do you have a hard time making friends or maintaining friendships, do you talk over others or finish their sentences, do you have a hard time waiting for your turn, do you zone out or get distracted during group conversations, or when speaking to someone else one on one

- work behavior; are you disorganized, have you ever been fired, what feedback have managers provided you in the past, do you have issues being on time

- home life behavior; conflicts with family, ability to keep up with chores

- DSM criteria evaluation (all yes/no questions)

I scored a 9/9 for inattentive behavior

6/9 for hyperactive behavior

and 5/5 for meeting DSM criteria for diagnosis. 

when asking specific questions sometimes she'd ask for examples - like ""do you have a tendency to put off keeping up with your home?""

""can you provide examples?"" 

""I just avoided cleaning my office for 3 weeks. I leave dishes in the sink for way longer than I know I should. I don't vacuum or wipe down surfaces nearly as often as I should."" 

she also asked if I lose/misplace things often and asked for examples. my phone, my water bottle, chapstick, hairbrush, moisturizer... yeah, tons of shit. 

she listened. she asked for elaboration. she did not challenge me, or doubt the truthfulness of my experiences. after the call I spoke with my partner and he was like ""you downplayed a lot of your symptoms/weren't totally honest with her"" and I literally told him, I wanted it to be believable, I didn't want to come across like I was exaggerating so I could get drugs 😐 plus honestly a lot of stuff I didn't mention I just forgot, in the moment 🤷🏼‍♀️ I wasn't intentionally downplaying, that's just part of the masking and coping mechanisms... 

anyway, imo it would've been hard to fake my way into a diagnosis. I hope your evaluation goes as smoothly as possible. she prescribed me some low dose Vyvanse to titrate up in dosage over the next month, then we'll evaluate how/if it's working. 

I will say though, I'm already on antidepressants and Wellbutrin so prescribing Strattera never would have happened or made sense for me.",1,##a
"So for me, I found out the hard way that this drug needs to be taken with food.

I also found out that there’s a suuuuper nasty reaction to just being hot/ in heat while on strattera.

What’s more, I was on 40mg once a day and that single dose was causing a tightening in my chest so I broke it into two doses- a 25mg and an 18mg about 6-8 hrs apart.

Once I figured all of these out, just mitigating the nausea was the big thing and even then, my partner would ask if I’m fine and then note that my face was red and suddenly I’d feel disgustingly hot and light headed and then I was sick. There’s been times where I’d feel this in the middle of work too and it always threw me off. I put up with this all for almost a year before I told my doctor that this needs to stop.",1,"suuuuper nasty reaction, tightening in, chest"
"Let me start with it’s great that you don’t have to deal with all of this. 

But, unfortunately yes, it was bad for me. Several times my partner noticed I was having an episode essentially and he knew I’d be sick before I even felt it hit me. My face would flush and become excessively red, I’d start sweating like crazy- and I already sweat bad- and then a massive wave of nausea would hit me. 

This was happening no less than 2-3 times a month. If I managed a full week without these issues I was lucky… or I missed a dose.

Strattera is like birth control, it really **should** be taken at the same time every day, not *just* with food. My prescribing dr had me in and out of a telehealth appt in like 5 mins after keeping me in their waiting room for almost 30mins and gave me absolutely zero info with this med. I work in a pharmacy and found a lot of info out from my work mom- a pharmacist.

What I tried believing for a while was that it’s just the summer and heat and atomoxetine (strattera generic) don’t like to commingle. But then these issues persisted through a pretty frigid winter and felt just as bad.",1,
"I was on it, I don't remember how long though. I had heart palpitations severe enough to call my cardiologist about the chest pains.

"I've been feeling really anxious since I'm about to start on strattera after a bad exp with Ritalin (nearly passed out on the road). I tend to get intense menstrual cramp pains on day 1 and sometimes 2 of periods, and I've mentally curbed my ability to vomit (I would rather suffer than puke), so I'm nervous about the nausea that people are describing. I've seen a lot of negative experiences with strattera on here but I don't know if it's because people with bad experiences are just louder or more likely to post about it than the people who've been doing well. Seeing the more neutral or positive threads are helping me feel okay with it and I'll definitely be referencing peoples experiences as I start my journey.",1,"intense, menstrual cramp pains, nausea"
"I’m going to be starting strattera tomorrow. I had them start me on a lower dose (25mg), when they mentioned the nausea, because I work in construction, and can’t afford to be blinded-sides by overwhelming nausea while I’m up to an hour away from home at a site I got to in someone else’s van. Once I have a better idea how it will affect me, I might have them raise the dose. Hopefully, it works out. The thing I’ve heard that actually worries me the most is some people in other threads and subreddits saying that they get crazy fatigue around midday. I’m hoping that doesn’t happen to me. Being too tired to function isn’t a side-effect you can afford if you do manual labor.

"Just searched for this since I am on day 3 of Strattera after Vyvanse made me angry and emotional, and Concerta made me depressed. 

First day I threw up within 20-30 minutes of taking the pill. I was almost going to quit right then cause a different (non-ADHD) med made me puke without fail and it felt the same. But I took Pepto bismol and ginger gravol the last two days and no puking!

"I definitely think that might be why so many people hate it! I know it’s probably true because I also take an SSRI (Zoloft) and those definitely can make someone feel worse before the medication starts to work. The first few weeks on an SSRI can feel like crap, and same after a dose increase. I definitely felt more irritable during the first month of strattera, and I recognized some of the same feelings that I got from Zoloft. 

A big part of it is that the side effects are often more severe early on, but there are no benefits.",1,irritable
"I always see people talking about how stratterra was hell for them and how the side affects were unbearable. My experience was completely different. I had almost no side affects (maybe the slightest bit of nausea in the beginning) but I also didn’t feel any difference. 

However, on the days that I forgot to take it I would notice that I was just really annoying (for lack of a better word). I interrupted people more and couldn’t get the right words out and also was just more distractible. I took it for maybe two or three months until I went on different meds. 

I did take generic strattera (which is called atomoxetine) so the lack of side effects could very well be because it’s a different manufacturer.",1,nausea

A year an a half ago I left my university due to a manic episode. I was an impatient for a week. 

I was in a fraternity so I had been frequently binge drinking, along with taking Focalin for my ADHD, and smoking pot quite frequently.  I was also pretty high stressed and had mild depression. After a weekend of LSD and ecstasy I turned manic.

From then on, I became stable on risperdal 1mg, 300 lamictal, and .5 clonazapam.

I returned to school the following semester without any problems. I remained at school for the summer and against my school psychiatrist's recommendation I decided to come off of my meds. I followed his instructions on discontinuing the medication and before I was completely off of them I now realize that I was becoming fixated on ADHD. I would read books, online articles, and frequently I would explain my behavior in conjunction with what an ADHD person would do. It was extremely hard to read and do summer school homework because I blamed my ADHD. 

I started to self medicate by drinking about 5 cups of coffee a day and taking melatonin as well as Vitamin B6 and Magnesium. 

Nothing helped. 

With the added stress of finals I took three 50 mg Vyvanse over the course of three days to study for a final exam. I tried to sleep during this period of time but I'd say I went around 50 hours with little to no sleep. 

After finals came the beginning of Fall semester and my social anxiety was at an all time high. With my fraternity brothers moving back in I had difficulty maintaining conversations (mainly focus) with people and became withdrawn. I was afraid to go into the foyer because girls might be around and was basically walking on eggshells. This was strange because I am a fairly social person.


I then had very intense derealization where nothing on earth seemed real. I had to come home and I was even afraid of my parents because they didn't seem real. I had no emotional connection with them and it was like living with strangers than the parents that I truly love. At this point my school psychiatrist put me back on 150 lamictal, 1 mg risperdal, and .5 clonazapam

Anyways, My school psychiatrist recommended staying on my meds for at least 1 year after my derealization episode.

I tried to get through school with the derealization which lasted nearly 2 months but I had to leave school again.

I returned back to school in the spring and did well again. I came home this summer and did just fine. My home psychiatrist took my off of risperdal and at my next appointment before school starts he wants to begin discontinuing the lamictal. 

I am unsure as to stop taking the lamictal. I read that derealization can be caused by stopping the medication. Am I serving any purpose by staying on the medication? 

Basically I am confused because I don't have a definitive diagnosis. At the impatient facility I was categorized as Bipolar NOS but I have no family history of it. My doctor won't prescribe amphetamines to me although I have an ADHD diagnosis from when I was 10. I even asked for Strattera and he wouldn't give me that.

Right now I'm completely normal despite attention difficulties. One doctor thinks I should stay on meds, and the other not. They both have 30+ years experience so I don't know who to go along with.


TLDR: manic episode after LSD and ecstasy, got medicated half a year, came off meds and had derealization, went back on meds just fine for close to 9 months, now my other doctor has me coming off all meds while my school doctor wants me to remain on them.",1,man
"I'm a 28 year old female doctoral candidate in consulting psychology. I have severe ADHD-PI. 

I'm smart (WAIS says IQ is 139) and have a lot of social anxiety. I was diagnosed with the ADHD as a junior in college (age 20) after a lifetime of lateness, hopeless disorganization, number transposing, and general flakiness. Secondary Dx of generalized anxiety that's probably related to years of maladaptive coping with the ADHD.

Medicine changed my life- I was given a fully funded position in a top 10 PhD program in my field, I earned a Master's degree. I passed my doctoral candidacy exams.

I became sensitized to stimulants after 2.5 years. My BP/HR spiraled up and up as my GP tried a roulette of medications. Even Strattera, which is not a stimulant, causes hypertension. They had to pull me off meds.

In the 2 years since, my life has fallen apart around me. I'm a year behind on my dissertation, my living space is an absolute disaster, and I'm constantly late and an emotional mess. My anxiety is through the roof and depression is taking over. My BP/HR are permanently elevated and I'm looking at a lifetime of taking beta blockers.

I didn't have insurance until recently. I've been searching out a psychiatrist for close to a month now, and cannot get ANYONE who treats ADHD to take me on as a patient. The secretaries ask a million questions about my history, I call back 3 or 4 days later, and they tell me the doctor can't take my case on. They refer me to someone else. 

I have literally talked to every ADHD specialist who accepts my insurance in a  40 mile radius (7 total). I have run the whole circuit and no one will help me. My GP doesn't feel comfortable dabbling in the off-label Rxs my case is going go require.

What do I do? What do I need to say to get a doctor to take me on? Do I need to be more interesting? ""Sell"" my case differently? Obtaining mental health care shouldn't be this difficult!!!",1,##ypertens
"So you're asking a couple different kinds of questions.  The certifying board for child psychiatry in the US is called AACAP, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.  They quite literally write the practice guidelines for assessing, diagnosing, treating, and monitoring of psychiatric disorders in young people, which are drawn from all recent data and systematically reviewed about every 5-10 years, depending on new developments. All of your ADHD questions are answered in their guidelines and summary of current data.

From their current practice guidelines for ADHD:
""Overall, ADHD is one of the best-researched disorders in medicine, and the overall data on its validity are far more compelling
than for many medical conditions.""^1

There were two large landmark studies done for ADHD, the MTA study and the MMPT study.  Both were long-term, large-scale, randomized clinical trials studying the efficacy of stimulant medication and psychosocial interventions (essentially therapy.)  Overwhelmingly the evidence suggests that stimulant medications work well and are safe.  The data for behavioral intervention/therapy alone was weak.  As almost always, the best approach is a combination of medication + therapy, but in this case medication >>> therapy. 

Side effects from stimulant medication in kids are actually relatively rare and mostly can be mitigated. The most worrisome are usually sleep disturbance and appetite suppression leading to low height/weight for age.  Both can be addressed by carefully choosing the dose, duration of activity, and timing of medication (there are a ton of different formulations that work for 4, 8, 12, 24 hours, so the granularity can be quite fine.) There are lots of adjunct treatments/therapy strategies that can help too.

>only to treat what is arguably not a particularly threatening condition.

ADHD casts a huge financial and emotional burden.  Education has been shown time and time again to be the primary predictor for a host of ""successful adult"" metrics.  Children with untreated ADHD are at a higher risk of dropping out of school, higher risk of physical and emotional abuse, higher risk of incarceration, and a higher risk of drug use (they often seek out elicit drugs to self-medicate.) That doesn't even take into account the emotional and relational burden these diseases cause.  The costs of mental illnesses and disorders is insidious, but well-documented.^2    

>Would I be correct in thinking psychiatry is trying to move away from these meds as the ubiquitous therapy for ADHD?

I see absolutely no evidence to support that statement. As the above analysis and guidelines show, there is a preponderance of evidence that stimulant medication is the most effective treatment for childhood/adolescent ADHD.

>Or moving towards enforcing more careful and stringent use of them at least?

We are always doing this.  The reality of the situation is that adults feel great on these stimulant medications.  They increase focus and energy, they decrease appetite and promote weight loss, they decrease the need for sleep.  The side effect profile is, with appropriate use, minimal.  These are the closest things we have to miracle pills. Right now it is not socially acceptable to most people to live in a ""Limitless"" style world.  This is a social construct and we as a sociocultural group are struggling with how we integrate pharmacology into our daily lives.  Nobody has answers about this except philosophers and artists currently.

>Perhaps a more radical question would be, Is ADHD really a ""true,"" phenotypically distinct disorder?

All psychiatric disorders are constructs; they are descriptive not prescriptive.  That is why we call them ""disorders"" rather than diseases usually.  They are constellations of symptoms that we have aggregated together because they often arise together.  There is almost certainly not one single ""disease"" of Schizophrenia, or example.  Current understanding proposes a combinations of genetic, epigenetic, environmental, triggered by stress.  This is called the [Diathesis Stress Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diathesis%E2%80%93stress_model) and is still hypothetical (though supported by some early evidence.)

>If it is a construct, what does this say about the ethics of using such meds as performance enhancers? Can it be argued that that is really what they are in the first place here even for those with ADHD?

There are underlying physiological changes in brains with ADHD^3.  That suggests that at least somewhere there is a dysfunction that underlies these changes, and by all current research, stimulants correct or at least mitigate that dysfunction in people with ADHD.  This is not simply ""performance enhancement.""  This is medical treatment.  

>If and when you do use them, how do you determine which med best suits the particular patient, and what is its proper dose?

Based on evidence, side effect profile, and each unique patient presentation to maximize their daily function and minimize their frustration, adjusted by literally 10,000 hours of residency training.

"Worst thing I wasn’t told was to not stop taking them. I was on Ritalin/Concerta since 8-ish years old, when I was a teen I began not taking them on weekends, then in my last year of school I would only take them when I went to school (which was maybe 2-3 days a week, I would only go to classes that I knew I actually needed to try for). So slowly I fell apart, before finally going to Uni and just dropping out because I’d stopped taking them, not really realising why everything felt different. A Bad couple years from there, and a worse year later I realised that properly diagnosed ADHD isn’t something you just grow out of (which is also something doctors will tell you).          
          
And yes, the dexamphamine rush at the right dose is just like that. Suddenly your muscles release, you feel like you can move without clumsiness, you can notice a certain finesse to every motion that wasn’t there before. Suddenly things are quiet. That’s the hardest thing to explain, people will see you rushing and full of energy, but in your mind things are actually quiet for once. It’s as though your brain waves have shifted from white noise to a pure sine wave. Rather than noticing *everything* and getting overwhelmed, you only see what’s important. And rather than being overwhelmed by whatever emotion you feel right now, your mind correctly links previous events to where you have the full image to deal with things.        
           
As for the comedown, they’re pretty shit yeah.  It can range from sudden paranoia and anxiety, to general stress, ill feelings, melancholic depression, even times of mild dissociation where it suddenly feels like you’re watching someone else’s life play out in front of your eyes. However, there’s also times where the meds wear off and I feel hypomanic, senses become more intense than even the dexie rush, suddenly nothing matters and everything is great. I have a feeling that’s more to do with my own personal genetics rather than a common trend though.       
        
That all said, the most important thing in the equation is sleep. If you’re taking stimulants, you need something that’s going to put you to sleep. The comedown and side effects are greatly intensified when your mind is unrested, and along with this the medication becomes less effective at helping symptoms.

"For the folks it works for it works better, but it doesn't seem to have much effect for a lot of folks.  I generally find most people will see some minor-moderate benefits from Wellbutrin, and taken up to 450mg and paired with coping strategies it is often sufficient for folks who for whatever reason cant or dont want to use a ""stimulant"".    
I probably don't trial strattera often enough to be a real good source of info on it, but one of the rehab centers in my community has been starting a lot of folks on it recently (I've gotten three clients that were diagnosed with ADHD and started on strattera while in a 30 day rehab program in the last 2 months...).  For one client its been great, the other two I ended up switching, one to wellbutrin as he was not showing much benefit with strattera, and had comorbid (really much more pronounced than adhd) depression.  I just got the PA for my other client to trial modafanil (as she is engaging well in our SUD program and has a sig. history of cocaine abuse and there is some evidence of efficacy of modafanil in treating cocaine addiction), she didn't see any benefits from strattera and had nausea each day when taking it after titrating to 80mg.

"Not sure if I’m posting this in the right place but I’m a tad anxious without much access to medical advice. I went to get ready for bed this evening and absentmindedly took my Nortriptyline (75mg) and Strattera (60mg), which I usually take in the morning. There were about 14 hours between the two doses but I have in total taken 150mg of Nortriptyline and 120mg of Strattera today...I’m currently on holiday in a foreign country and am kind of nervous. Is there any reason to worry or should I be OK with the fourteen hour window between the two?",1,
"Finally got an actual psychiatrist recently. Before, my general practitioner just put me on Wellbutrin for depression. And doc is... Efficient? The few appointments we've had were telehealth and lasted no more than 15 minutes (aside from our initial assessment, which was just 30 minutes). She was a little dismissive of my interest in an autism test but agreed to an ADHD test (which surprise surprise, I got).

Since my depression was still bad, she bumped me up from 150mg to 300mg and decided to wait on prescribing anything for ADHD since Wellbutrin can also treat it and maybe that would help?

It's been a month and depression has gotten a little better, but my ADHD feels worse? Or maybe I'm just more aware of it now, but it's frustrating. I also have a history of chronic insomnia and migraines. 

I'd like to go into our next appointment with some other non-stimulant options so that I don't feel rushed by the time limit. 

EDIT: went with Strattera after some suggestions. Doc said 4-6 weeks for results, but I read elsewhere 8-12 weeks. No improvement yet, of course, but side effects I’ve encountered: dry mouth, nausea, insomnia, lower libido, disappointing results in the bedroom. Today we decided to go from 25-40mg.",1,"##hd, dry mouth, nausea, insomnia, lower libido"
"Hello, I’ve been medicated since age 10. Nothing has helped, either had zero effect or made me worse in other ways. 

I decided to give up on medications thinking it would be better for me but I suppose it’s not helping.

Only thing I take psychiatry wise is adderall and it’s helped me more than any other medication in the past.

I’ve seen probably over10 or 20 psychiatrists in my life trying to find something to help me so I have various diagnoses. I will put them in two categories.

Ones that follow me around and I think accurately describe what I’m going through: PTSD, adhd, ASD, GAD, and depression.

Ones that were only diagnosed once by various psychiatrists (after talking to the psychiatrist for the first time for fifteen minutes while reading down a checklist, also worth noting they had very poor reviews and reputations) and I do not strongly identify with: OCD, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder

Although my depression is the source of my suicidal ideations and prevents me from feeling joy or happiness, anxiety probably affects me more in the day to day from the perspective of others.

List of medications I have tried:
Abilify, prozac, oxcarbazepine, seroquel, strattera, buspar, Wellbutrin, luvox",1,##icidal idea
"I was recently battling depression and anxiety (or so I thought & thought I needed meds.). I also have some QUESTIONS that need to be answered to see if anybody has had the same **EXPERIENCE.** This past year and a half I've been through four different medications. I know the medications aren't supposed to be miracle pills; they're just supposed to aid and support your mental health. The majority of it was negative for me.

**Wellbutrin (Bupropion 10 mg NDRI)** I first started with this one, which gave me crippling panic/anxiety attacks the first couple weeks I took it; It got so bad to the point where I had curled up into a fetal position, ball my eyes out, and scream because it was so bad. I couldn't focus at work because it felt like the world was gonna end. Stopped taking it immediately after that day.

**Strattera (Atomoxetine 40-80 mg SRNI)** 2nd medication I was started on after waiting a week. The side effects ranged from insomnia to nausea (gastric issues et. al) for about two weeks, then it got better. The fatigue side effect would be off and on as well as intense brain fog some days. I took 40 mg for about two months then bumped up to 80 mg after. This medication slightly dimmed my emotion, made me more impulsive, fatigued, and did not help with focus at all. I took this for 5 months with little to no change and it did more harm than good.

**Lexapro** **(Escitalopram 10 mg SSRI)** I started taking this one after Strattera; It was good until it wasn't for me. Absolutely zero side effects in the beginning, I actually noticed an improvement in my mood about a month in, I would wake up with a nice head buzz, feel more energetic, and ready to get things done for the day. *But*, this wouldn't be consistent throughout the seven months I was taking this medication, and it better then worse around the 4-5 month mark; made me numb and not give a crap about anything. I was skipping class, didn't do assignments, stopped going to the gym (I LOVE THE GYM), skipped out on some very important things, and last but not least chronic fatigue. I just stopped taking them and started taking my last medication a week after.

**Effexor (Venlafaxine 75 MG XR SRNI)** Not much to go off of here, literally just felt the same as I did with Lexapro and just threw it away after 2 weeks and since then I've been antidepressant free for 3 weeks now.

I got tired of it, and I threw away my medications because I got super tired of trying new stuff for it not to even help and going through this cycle of hell with the side effects and these medications doing more harm then good.

Since I stopped *I feel so amazing,* it's like my emotions rebounded 10 fold and made me appreciate the feelings of sadness, happiness and taking emotions for granted. Like not Mania; I just felt normal again, I could focus and do the things I wanted to again. Social anxiety is gone, I can push aside dark/sad thoughts, and felt alive and not like a zombie. Also my libido shot through the roof and it's still SO HIGH. FYI I didn't feel these things until about a week and half after I stopped taking SSRI's/SRNI's. It turns out I was fighting a battle in my head that I couldn't win and thought medication was a cure- I now realize that wasn't the case and I am very happy I stopped; I was very worried about quitting because of the withdrawals people get but I have had no problem with anything & straight positives. I hold a deeper appreciation of feeling human now.

I also would've wished I was on the side where antidepressants do work for me! Just from my bad experiences please don't let it deter you because these might actually save your life someday! I didn't have the patience and didn't like the way they made me feel; that's why I stopped and now I'm better.

I would like to know if anybody has had a similar or same experience as me.

TL;DR

stopped antidepressants (wellbutrin, strattera, lexapro, effexor) because they made me feel like caca, and since stopping them i feel human again and amazing again.",1,"insomnia, ##tric, brain fog"
"I'm on stablon, but feel i have a problem with dopamine and get so mentally unwell with any rejection from traumatic life events, or not get validation. Ive tried SSRIs but don't seem to work and give me sexual function problems. Also they arent effective enough to cross taper from stablon.

Wellbutrin is much better for my depression and I can cross taper on it from stablon when im not stressed but makes me anxious and worsens my insomnia, makes me a bit socially awkward.

"Hey all.

I need some advice. (I do have a therapist and psychiatrist. They know that I am still struggling.)

How do you jump start motivation to do ""things""? 

I have been on a range of medications for over two years now. I started on Lexapro, switched half a dozen times to other meds due to side effects, and am now on Prozac and ADHD stuff. 

Before meds, I was a bit of a adrenaline junkie. I went hiking, biking, traveling, etc. Playing video games was a fun past time I could do for HOURS. I actively did things or would hyper focus on new hobbies all the time. 

I just had extremely bad anxiety and boughts of debilitating depression. 😔

Since starting meds to help curb the anxiety/depression, I now struggle to find the drive to do ""fun"" things. I can't play video games for very long. Hiking is more like a chore. And pretty much everything I do for fun, I am doing it because I am forcing myself to be active with the hope that I can jump start the motivation/hyper focus of something. 

Any tips on how to get out of the funk? It's kind of like I am stuck in constant executive dysfunction. 

My meds:
Prozac
Concerta 
Strattera 
Vit D

At least my anxiety is better! I just somehow lost all desire for fun and now just would rather sleep to pass the time. Lmfao.

"Hi guys. This is my first post and i was just looking for some insight. For starters i was recently diagnosed with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, bpd, adhd, and ptsd. I started off taking vraylar and was so excited bc so many people talked highly of it. It was the worst thing ive ever done. My anxiety was at an all time high and it made me so paranoid. I was unable to sleep bc i was terrified somebody was going to break into my house. I went days without sleeping before finally being taken off it. I was then switched to abilify. After taking that for awhile my psychiatrist added welbutrin and strattera. Ive been on the welbutrin for 6 weeks now and im not feeling anything. I find myself still laying around, i cant clean, i cant cook, i hardly ever feel like showering. My depression is at an all time high and it feels like there’s no end. I also feel like my anxiety is worst right now. I even still have severe anxiety and paranoia left from take the vraylar. After expressing this to my psychiatrist she just added lexapro to go with the welbutrin. I guess im just curious if anyone has be on welbutrin and it not worked? Or is taking the combo of welbutrin and lexapro together and it working? Im feeling hopeless at this point that nothing is working for me. Any advice?",1,"bipolar, bpd, ##hd, ##noia"
"This experience will not be universal, but I thought it'd be worth sharing since my experience with antidepressants felt very hopeless, with nothing working. I was constantly fatigued, could not be motivated to do anything, and felt incredibly anxious. I was prescribed Wellbutrin, Zoloft, and Strattera (diagnosed with Depression, PTSD/Anxiety, and ADHD) and took them for years, but felt like the symptoms never got significantly better... a little bit at most. For the past 6 years, it felt like medications just kept getting piled onto the list, with each one as pointless as the next.

I went to a doctor for seemingly-unrelated issues and got a blood test, which found that I was severely iron deficient and that I had been reacting negatively to gluten, among many other things. This caught me incredibly off-guard, since I'd been eating 'healthy,' in an attempt to help with depression symptoms. I had never considered that what is commonly understood as healthy eating, was actually doing more damage than good, for me. 

It turns out that my stomach was in a perpetual state of stress with the fact that I was constantly eating things that I was intolerant to, and therefore hadn't been processing serotonin properly, and that I was very nutrient deficient. 

Over the past 9 months, I've started feeling like a different person. I've begun eating according to my restrictions, which is a pain in the ass, don't get me wrong, but I've started feeling SO much better. I finally have energy and motivation, and feel like I've come back from a waking slumber. I was un-diagnosed with depression and anxiety (the PTSD and ADHD are still definitely there though,) and taken off of my medications. For now, the medications have been replaced with supplements, until my blood tests start coming back normal, but it's so nice not to have my mental state altered anymore.

I feel like I'm regaining the personality that anti-depressants stripped me of, and although I'm the annoying person that has to ask ""does this have X, Y, or Z in it"" at every restaurant, I feel freed and healthy now. At the very least, I definitely recommend everyone who can get a full blood test— it's great to know what's going on inside your body, even if it doesn't feel actively ill.

With that, I'll now be leaving this sub, it's been great y'all, and I wish you luck!

"Undiagnosed ADHD, working on that, my main problems are procrastination, time blindness, overwhelming, avoidance, anxiety etc. I can usually describe my depression in relation to the issues i have with ADHD which affect my self esteem, hope(lessness) and motivation(lack), but feel less depressed when around people or doing things for other people. I currently take generic of all these brands: pristiq 100 mg, Strattera 60mg, Wellbutrin 450, took a blood test and doc started L-Methylfolate Cal 15 mg. I am a type 1 diabetic and take levothyroxine for my hypothyrodism. f

I tried Quelbree but the side effects were to much, so I'm back on strattera. I was on 100 mg before but now i'm on 60 mg. When i was on the increased dose of Strattera i felt like it did help quiet my anxiety each time (just not any other adhd stuff). But my biggest problem is being sleepy after taking my antidepressants in the morning. (i can't take these pills at night they make me sleep weird or feel like i didn't get good sleep). Every day.  Sometimes I can push throughiit but it's very hard, i don't feel properly awake unless it's later in the day or i'm super busy.

Things have changed a bit though. My doc started me on L-Methylfolate Cal 15 mg, and we decided to decrease my wellbutrin to 300 mg and keep my strattera at smaller dose 60. I still struggle with sleepiness, about hour or two after taking meds. Please note higher dosing or now dosing I still struggle with same adhd stuff.

I have an appointment coming up with my psychatrist and I know shes going to ask me all sorts of questions about how i'm feeling on this doses. I feel little bit depressed and uninterested in things but also not feeling depressed and interested in things, still sleepy and could nap everyday but defenietly not as sleepy as max dosage wellbutrin and strattera. Adhd stuff is still there but also very tiny bit better? Still hard to motivate myself yet I have found myself a bit motivated. Sometimes interested in sex sometimes not.

I wonder if i'm feeling how i feel because i decreased the wellbutrin? Should i try different medicine besides wellbutrin? I don't know for certain but i've never felt like wellbutrin has given me energy all these years, i'm sure it has in some ways but idk (idk vs. being off of it i mean).

I’ve seen a few posts on here about Wellbutrin and I have been an advocate for it in terms of sexual feelings/libido coming back (somewhat). But what I’ve also seen recently is that this causes increased irritability/anger. I never knew this until my psych told me about it a couple weeks ago. I’ve been such an asshole to my girlfriend. To my son. Getting mad at the dogs for doing the smallest things (not physically harming anyone/anything). I feel terrible now. I’ve noticed a significant change in mood and now that it’s identified I feel like I need to make the switch or add something to it. Or maybe reduce dosage. I’ve started strattera but only took once because it made me nauseous and triggered my anxiety so bad. Do others typically take an ssri with Wellbutrin?

"I've been on 40 mg celexa since September. It's worked so well for my anxiety and depression. Starting meds is the best decision I've made.

The downside is it's totally messed up my brain in some ways. Before meds I was type A, tidy, organized, on top of everything. I started a new job this year and I've been a disaster. I can't focus, I'm messy, unorganized, I forget things, my mind can't grasp a lot. It's beyond embarrassing because people notice it.

" 

I was on 10mg of Fluoxetine for 5-6 years. This was along with taking an ADHD medication called Strattera. About two years ago now I lost all emotions and feelings. I can't love, I can't enjoy things, I'm walking through life like there is nothing. I've had the sexual dysfunction for a while now and Welbutrin helped a bit a while ago but now I've started taking it again and it's barely done anything for me. Muted orgasms and genital numbness, have to work very hard to achieve orgasm. I also find I have poor memory and confusion sometimes. It's hard to focus but I don't want to add any ADHD medications into the mix before I feel again. Feeling again is what I care about the most. I also do have some motor coordination issues, general clumsiness, etc.

Medications I've tried: Welbutrin, Pristiq, Trintellix, Cymbalta, and Buspar

So guys...I really wanna know the truth. How screwed am I for ever enjoying life again? I feel like every single thing I do is a waste because I can't enjoy any of it. I've lost a lot of important moments to it already and god knows how many more I will. The numbness and pressure in my head has dissipated or I've just gone numb to it. Every few weeks I'll have a little blip of feeling some excitement but it's quickly gone again.

This started when I was almost 17 and now in less than 10 days I'll be 19. (Also I am a male.)

Is there any hope for ever recovering? Any medications that may help or have helped people here? I'm trying not to give up but it's harder every year as I feel more hopeless and angry that this happened to me because of a pill, this NEVER should have happened. Also angry that I see everyone else enjoying life and taking things for-granted while I sit here in my room and rot away because I can do nothing.

I've tried exercising and it makes me feel more alert I guess? I also drink coffee every morning.

I've also been diagnosed with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy which I am currently on lamictal for.

I'm sorry for my all over the place rant/post guys, I'm just lost. Just made this account because I don't want it to be seen on my personal.

"Hi folx! 
I’m quite new here so please forgive me if I miss any standards or something but I was wondering if anyone might have an opinion or is going through something similar. 

I’m quite new to meds for mental health in general. I started my first antidepressant last September & it didn’t really do much (Wellbutrin). Then I got Lexapro & it’s been going ok. The worst symptoms I need to manage, however, are actually for executive dysfunction. I had suspected ADHD for a while but only got the diagnosis last month.

My doc wanted me to try a nonstimulant med & it started to work but after increasing the dosage it just... kinda didn’t work as well? 

So I’m now effectively on an SSRI (Lexapro) & an ADHD med that’s an RI for norepinephrine (Strattera). 

& now it seems that some of my depression is starting to hit again & I’m starting to lose it because I’m back with my parents for the summer & they’re horribly invalidating & unaccepting. I never even get time to myself because of COVID. (I’m 23 but still don’t drive—working on it!—& work at home). 

I’m now struggling with insomnia too which isn’t a common problem for me. 

So basically—it seems like my meds aren’t really as effective anymore & IDEK if it’s because they’re not quite the right meds or doses OR if it’s plainly just because of all the stress going on with COVID & my uncomfortable living environment. 

Have any of you been struggling to parse things out because of what’s going on these days? How do you approach assessing your meds’ efficiency when all these things are going on?",1,executive
"I'm suffering by **depressions and anxiety** with panic attacks.

Unfortunatelly It looks like I have very unpleasant side efects from SSRIs and SNRIs. **I can't cry**. It may seems like a good thing but if something bad happened and I feel urge to cry, but I can't, it's very very unpleasant. Also when I watch some emotional video I used to cry before, now I can't feel that emotions any more.
I'm also not sure if I can fall in love any more. I had 1.5 year relationship and I really liked that girl though I didn't feel I'm in love with her.
Also I have that feeling like I can't really enjoy good moments. **I just never feel truly happy**. I can laugh, I can smile but It looks like I can't experience intense feelings except of moments when I'm drunk which led to I started to drink a really lot. Also have **problems to reach orgasm** and don't enjoy sex like I used to.

First time I noticed that was when I was for 4 years on Venlafaxine. But when I look back I know I had it whole time. I have also feeling It got worse since I quitted smoking. But whole time I though I just still suffer by depression a little bit. Then I stopped taking Venlafaxine order to try a new medication I very soon felt difference. **Suddenly I could enjoy little things** like nice weather, sunny day or sunset, etc. I also started feel emotions so much intense. I also became much more empathetic. I fall in love with a girl 2 months after I left medication. Unfortunatelly my anxiety and depression came back soon.

**Now I don't know what to do**. I need some meds cause it seems like I'm not able to live without it but I also don't want to go back to emotional emptyness.

I haven't tried any combination of medacation yet. All of them separately. I tried:

- *Venlafaxine* - emotional blunting

- *Strattera* - didn't work for me at all.

- *Low doses of Amisulpride* - which helped a lot with depression but It caused I slept for 13hours/day and didn't help with anxiety.

- *Buspirone* - to try to get rid of anxiety but it didn't work for me at all.

- *Lamotrigine* - which didn't help with my anxiety

- *Paroxetine* - emotional blunting + absence of motivation

- *Citalopram* - emotional blunting + horrible physical side effects

- *Sertraline* - emotional blunting

I'm staring to be really desperate and my doctor told me she don't want to treat me any more due to I'm not good patient and I'm not trying. I found new psychiatrist and I will have a first appointment in 2 weeks but I don't know what to suggest her.

**I was thinking about Wellbutrin** but what I read it doesn't help with anxiety.

Next thing which came to my mind is to **take Wellbutrin together with Sertraline** to try counter side effects of emotional blunting - have anybody some experience with that?

Or try **some another antidepressant?** But I don't know which one and I have that feeling I'm starting to go out of options.

It started off as my throat keeping me up at night. I moved too quick about a month ago and moved a bone out of place below my jaw (was confirmed by doctor). It hurt really bad and I cried in pain every time I tried to swallow or talk. I somehow got it to go back into place and was just sore until my neck began clicking every time I swallowed. It would keep me up but then I got used to it and now I just don’t rest. This all started around the same time. Which is weird. I was honestly fine and then two weeks ago, my brain just stopped working. I’ve put myself in danger because of it and I’m genuinely worried. The memory and daze could be because of the insomnia. But I don’t want to overlook it if there’s something else it could be. Especially with it affecting my daily life and the random migraines I keep getting. I weigh 105, I’m 5’3 and my primary doctor says I’m perfectly healthy despite the number my weight is. I’m skinny but I’m about a size 4 and a small-medium in tops. So lack of eating isn’t the issue. I’m genuinely just exhausted but just can’t sleep.",1,"memory, ##ze"
" HELP! 25F, 5'1, 147 pounds, black. I do not drink or smoke. On Wellbutrin and Buspirone. Hello,

Context: I have ADHD and started taking 40mg of Strattera. I was on it for a week, but stopped due to high heart rate. After not taking it for a week my heart rate went back to a normal pace. My psychiatrist put me on a 25mg dose of Strattera thinking that the lower dose wouldn't be as bad. It was worse. I was on it for a month because I thought eventually my heart rate would go back to normal and it did not. Now, I am on Wellbutrin XL.
On this medication my heart can go up from 90 to 120 just walking from the couch to the kitchen.

Medication induced tachycardia
It's a great medication and it's been helping with my focus, but my heart rate has not gone down. While on all of these meds my heart rate would shoot up walking to my room to the kitchen. I do not want to get off of Wellbutrin, but I want my heart rate to go down to a normal pace. If I start doing cardio (walking 30 mins 5 times a week) will it stop going up too quickly? Will it eventually stay below 100?
What should I do? I've been trying to set up an appointment with a cardiologist, but some do not take my insurance. I'd really appreciate your help because I want to eventually start going to the gym again consistently and riding my bike.",1,"high heart rate, tachycardia, heart rate, shoot up"

I have been on Strattera since March of this year, I have been on the Paxil and Trazodone since May-ish. I have been having spells of shortness of breath and dizziness. Last night I was taking my grandmother’s vitals and went to check mine because it was a new BP cuff and wanted to make sure it wasn’t being yonky. The BP cuff picked up my pulse at 145, I thought it was being crazy so retested my grandma and got the same reading for her. 

I sat down for a bit to see if I was just excited even though I didn’t feel bad, I rechecked and it was resting at 123, when I stood it was shooting up to 150. It probably wasn’t ER worthy but I was convinced I was about to keel over, anyways, I do have a UTI and the doctor told me that it is likely due to all 3 mental health medications I’m on. He also said that it should be fine that everything comes with cost risk analysis, and I logically know that. I do plan on following up with my psychiatrist because it still is worrisome, but I was wondering if asymptomatic tachycardia is something that can cause issues if it’s prolonged, I have history of heart disease on both sides of my family. 

I know I need to quit vaping as well as that doesn’t help.

Pmhx: OCD, ADHD, and LPR

Meds: Zoloft 225 mg daily, Strattera 40 mg BID

I’ve been on Zoloft for OCD since I was about 14 years old. I’ve been on-and-off Strattera since I was about the same age. At least since my early-to-mid 20’s, I’ve occasionally woken up acting out my dreams. Typically it’s been shouting or kicking. Once I rolled onto the floor. 

I used to think it was a funny quirk until I read research linking RBD to future development of neurodegenerative disease. I felt better when I saw that in young females odds are it is usually just from SSRI/SNRI use. Then I felt worse again when I saw two more studies suggesting that in cases of serotonergic RBD, there is evidence to suggest that the medication just “unmasks” the neurodegenerative symptoms early.

So, neurologists and sleep specialists, what do we think? Is this just unmasking my future neurodegenerative condition early? I want the honest to God truth.

I was diagnosed with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus from lithium in 2013, was taken off lithium, on 12.5mg HCTZ for a year, trialed off it, everything came back relatively normal, was considered fine but no more lithium. 

My eGFR was lower (72) and has kept dipping down since then. My creatinine is high (within unflagged range, but 98 or 99) and my GP sent me for blood work, and a new renal ultrasound, my last one was in 2014. No change in blood work over the past 5 years, was told my kidneys are “stable”. 

Had the ultrasound on my bladder and kidneys. Report:

> IMPRESSION:

> Increased echogenicity of the renal pyramids is suspected bilaterally which can be seen with medullary sponge kidneys/nephrocalcinosis. Consider further evaluation with an enhanced CТ.

> No concerning renal lesions or hydronephrosis identified bilaterally. Mild cortical thinning bilaterally.

Then on Thursday I got a letter from my GPs office with an appointment for a bladder and renal/abdominal CT scan in 2 weeks. 

What are they looking for? From what I looked up of the ultrasound, that’s a fairly common thing that starts at birth? Why a CT scan? 

I’m just kinda panicky because I was told things are fine and then to get actual mail with an appointment in the next 2 weeks is really bizarre, I’m in Canada (Ontario). I’m confused a bit. I see my psychiatrist on the 30th. I have an appointment for something completely unrelated with my GP on the 29th. 

I was just hoping someone could tell me what’s going on, why they want more tests, and what are they looking for or ruling out? ",1,"ins, echogenicity of, renal, ##ning"

History of seizures
Here is the transcription of the text in the image:

So I was laying down, and I felt this odd feeling come over me, like an odd intense tingling, kinda like just before I have a seizure like I have had before, then all of a sudden I couldn't move any of my body, it wasn't like I had no control over my body, but like I was actively struggling against some force, it took all my effort to drop my arm from behind my head (where I had it prior to this) to my side, and when I tried to yell for help all I could get out was a strange scraping groan, like a cat coughing up a hairball but much weaker. This feeling and the one before I have a seizure are similar, but not exactly, whereas the former is a intense tingling that ran over my body several times, while the latter was centralized around my head and was very light and bubbly is the only one I can describe it as. I was also conscious for this experience whereas I lose consciousness for my seizures, I was fully conscious here.",1,

Hey all, posted on here in the beginning of the week with my early on symptoms. Woke up on Monday to tension and soreness in my left subscapular area into my neck/ collar bone. Couldn’t look up/ down without pain, left/right had no effect. Easy to trigger— for example we were driving home and I had to brace myself for turns and minor bumps or the pain shot up. 

Monday night got barely any sleep because I was woken up to intense pain in my left arm, tricep and like inner bicep area. Area felt like it was really hot (to me, not sure if to touch), and anything touching it hurt.  
Tuesday day and night pain got worse and started traveling into my elbow and forearm  and led to another sleepless night. 

Wednesday I started to feel intense pain in my wrist along with the rest of the pain and discomfort in the arm. 
Lay on ice, used icy hot lidocaine rub to ease pain. Tylenol and ibuprofen to help as well. 

Thursday aside from deep under my shoulder blade the pain in the upper part of my arm/neck/collar bone area was not as noticeable but was instead really intense in tricep, forearm and wrist. Same “hot” feeling and not being able to let anything touch it. I additionally “fell” when trying to lower myself onto the ground to stretch using my left arm as support— my arm just gave out and I fell on my face. 

Now, Saturday, I’ve been able to sleep almost normal but been waking up with intense almost nauseating pain in my elbow, same hot radiating pain in my forearm and continued loss of strength and stability with my left arm. 

Should I be concerned? What could this be? 

TLDR: Acute subscapular pain and tension now turned into loss of strength and stability in arm, wrist and forearm. ",1,

"I'm interested in being evaluated for autism or ADHD. Previous evaluations have included questions like, ""Do you have trouble maintaining eye contact?"" My answer is ""no,"" but it's because I've practiced _really, really hard_ over the years to maintain appropriate eye contact. When I was younger I definitely had trouble maintaining appropriate eye contact. So now my answer doesn't really seem to fit the spirit of the question.

I asked my psychiatrist whether I should answer questions like this with the objective, factual answer, or try to answer them as if I haven't practiced really hard to act correctly in social situations? She said she wasn't sure, and figured answering objectively was best, since otherwise I'm basically guessing. The upshot is I may seem more neurotypical on paper or in first impressions than I really am.

What are your thoughts on how best to answer these evaluations?

# Context:

I'm a 35-year-old male living in the US. I have a wife and 2 kids, a big sister, and my parents are both living and still married.

My dad may be autistic. When talking with others he rarely makes eye contact, maintains very closed body language, and fixates on facts and information. He's a retired classical piano professor who was extremely dedicated to his job, and practices the piano each day despite not really finding much _joy_ in piano. He's dedicated to being his church's treasurer, despite not finding much joy in religion either... I think it's how he feels close to others since he doesn't really have close friends, e.g. people he hangs out with apart from my mom. He has an encyclopedic knowledge about all kinds of historical facts, frequently talks to himself, and has many routines which aren't entirely necessary but he gets agitated if he doesn't do them (shaves every single day, makes the bed with hospital corners, etc). He's a sweet, gentle guy, he's devoted to my mom, and was a great and involved dad to me and my sister, but he's always been ""weird"". When my wife — a talented elementary school teacher — pointed out that he might be autistic, it was a big lightbulb moment for us.

Nobody in my mom's family shows so many signs of autism, but they're all highly educated loners who've been diagnosed with major depression and/or anxiety.

As for me, I have some behaviors that may be consistent with autism:

- Like my dad, I don't really have any close friends. I care deeply about lots of people, but don't feel comfortable ""hanging out"" or ""shooting the breeze"" one-on-one, which leads me to not try to keep in touch.
- By contrast, I love performing in front of groups of people, and as a kid did lots of drama, Model UN, speech, band, etc.
- I like being in groups of people much more than being one-on-one because I don't feel responsible for keeping up conversation, but still need to take little breaks in an empty room every 10-15 minutes. I usually try to find tasks to keep occupied, like washing dishes, running to the store, watching the kids, etc.
- Whenever I watch a movie/show or read a book, I get extremely absorbed, can't tolerate interruptions, and have to Google everything about it. It's distracting enough that now when a book/movie/show seems interesting I just read its plot summary on Wikipedia so that I don't feel the need to actually read/watch it.
- When trying to concentrate, I'm extremely easily distracted by the sounds of people, including music, the radio, conversation, etc. I always wear earbuds when working, although most of the time I'm not listening to anything. As a high schooler I would wear big noise-canceling construction earmuffs while doing homework, even though my house was generally very quiet.
- I'm a software engineer. I love to build things and solve problems.
- I live to work instead of work to live. If my job is interesting, I'll work nights and weekends on it (despite managers sometimes telling me to stop). Once my job stops being interesting, or I get too frustrated with inefficiencies that keep me from making progress, I quit, which so far has been every 1 - 2 years.
- In every job, people have said I'm a good teacher and mentor to junior employees, but seem disagreeable when working with people at or above my position in the org chart. Frustratingly, they can't point to specific behaviors that are disagreeable — they say I just _am_. I've worked really, really hard to improve, but without specific action-items it's been hard to make progress.
- I was diagnosed with depression and take 40mg Prozac per day, which made a big difference. Since talking with a psychiatrist about possible ADHD a year ago, I've also taken 40mg atomoxetine/Strattera per day — not sure if it helps, but it doesn't seem to hurt.

I feel really self-conscious and have worked extremely hard to seem ""normal"". So things that don't come naturally in social situations are more-or-less a habit, like:

- Making eye contact, without overdoing it
- Asking questions, and leaving opportunities to answer questions
- Maintaining open body language
- Phrasing things as ""we"" instead of ""me""/""you""
- Having some innocuous conversation topics on hand, like weather, trips, family, etc

...but these still all take effort, so while I tend to give a very good first impression, eventually the facade falls away and I start to seem aloof or arrogant. Having a diagnosis of autism or ADHD could really make a difference when it comes to others understanding my intentions. Thanks for your input!",1,
"Basically, I’ve been dealing with chronic illness my whole life. 

It doesn’t feel bad enough to warrant any real disability or diagnosis, but at the same time I don’t know if that’s just be downplaying my symptoms because I’m so used to them. Since I’m mostly self diagnosed, I have nothing on record to base my personal treatment on and I don’t know how to help myself. 

I don’t know, I think I just need reassurance I have chronic issues and I’m not just overreacting to being alive? Anyway,

The rundown:

- suspected chronic fatigue syndrome; it’s either that or POTS, or Ehlers Danlos or something else related. 

 - I’m constantly tired; I can sleep for 12-13 hours and still feel exhausted. My body gets sore pretty easily and I constantly have bruises I don’t know how I got. I need a lot of rest time between tasks and big rest days. I’m out of breath quickly, dizzy often, brain fog, my memory is horrible, to the point where I need to write down and chronicle my life and things I need to do or else I will forget. This makes it harder to talk to doctors too since I will forget all my symptoms the second I’m in an exam room.

- I want to reiterate on the brain fog. I can’t remember a time I didn’t have that. I think I have some kind of dissociative disorder. I just feel like I’m in a dream state often and can’t zone back in. 

- idk if related, but extreme sensitivity to substances; I self medicate with caffeine a lot but can only have less than 60-80 mg before it makes my anxiety horrible. I want a better alternative. Before my current antidepressant I went through 5 others on the lowest dose and dealt with side effects too bad to keep going. Have tried smoking weed but I can only have ~5mg until it sends me in a panic state. One drink of alcohol and I’m plastered; Everything just effects my body easily and I metabolize quickly. I’m a very small petite woman.

- suspected Visual Snow Syndrome; I say suspected but I don’t think I can just suspect something I see all the time. Since I could remember I’ve had static snow covering my entire field of vision. There’s little research on it, but I only realized not everyone has “TV vision” at 17 when my mom asked if I needed to go to the hospital for bringing it up. With the little research done, I’m wondering if it’s connected with anything I have issues with.

-suspected ADHD; I’m in therapy for it now but having a hard time getting medicated for it.I don’t know if my symptoms up there are related or not since I’m mostly self diagnosed still. I tired Strattera (40mg) recently, and while it made me less tired I also couldn’t sleep at all, and I was blacking out after standing up a lot more and experienced heightened anxiety and chest pain.

-anxiety / depression, as well as panic disorder. I’m on 25mg of Zoloft to manage. 

The only things on record are anemia, anxiety/depression and eczema, and when it comes to my anemia my iron levels have been good the last few times my levels have been tested, yet I still experience the extreme fatigue, blackouts, falling over when I stand up too fast; the usual. I’m starting to think they’re not connected at all. 

Speaking of levels, they’re always fine when I get them checked, so I don’t know if it’s a vitamin deficiency. I’m supposedly healthy.


I just want to have the energy to do the things I want and live a normal life. Please ask questions because I’m sure I left out some things I’ve forgotten. Any advice is appreciated.",1,"static, t, blacking out, heightened anxiety, chest pain, extreme fatigue, blackouts, falling over"

No smoking, no drinking, no drugs except the ones I'm prescribed by my psychiatrist. I take up to 1000mg of tylenol (recommended dose!) on occasion for severe headaches/migraines and period cramps. I take 2 women's multivitamins every morning. I'm on 300mg of bupropion (brand name wellbutrin) extended release in the morning and 50mg of sertraline (brand name zoloft) in the evening for anxiety and depression. Had been on 40mg of atomoxetine (brand name strattera) for about a year to treat ADHD by the time I had my first pneumothorax on Jan. 15th, but am now off of the medication due to it making my heart race, which had already been a concern prior.

Both pneumos were small and in the same location (left side, lower than my breast), and both occurred when I was sitting at my computer and doing no strenuous activities. Since they were small, I didn't have to have a tube put in my chest and was instead put on continuous oxygen in the ER for several hours. When I went in for the first pneumo on the 15th, I was given an EKG since I reported sudden, continuous, and severe chest pain on my left side that would radiate from the source — no heart attack, obviously, and no abnormalities aside from an extremely elevated heart rate (was between 100-120bpm when resting). BP was normal. I was given xanax (unsure of the dose) to try and lower my heartrate and calm the tremor I have in my hands. After a couple blood tests, a chest x-ray, and a CT scan with contrast, I was given my diagnosis, put on oxygen, and given some morphine for the pain. I spent \~3 days in the hospital: one night in the ER and one night admitted for observation. Was cleared with a chest x-ray in the morning on the 17th and had followups with my pcp. I was referred to a pulmonologist for followups by my pcp.

The second time was Jan. 3st and I knew it was a pneumothorax because I felt the pop. Went to the ER immediately. I was given an EKG anyways and my heartrate was high enough (over 110bpm at rest) that the ER physician decided to put a giant AED sticker on my side just in case it was determined that I required a hard reset. Otherwise, no heart abnormalities, BP was normal, etc etc. Had the same tests done, and was confirmed to have another small pneumothorax in the same location. Put on continuous oxygen and admitted during the first night for observation, stayed for another night and was discharged on Feb. 2nd. The cardiothoracic surgeon spoke to me about my case, told me there was no need to perform any surgery (no blebs on the CT and the pneumothorax was small enough to resolve on its own) and any surgical interventions to try and prevent further pneumothoraxes would cause more harm than good. He did note that the symptoms I reported aside from the pain (crackling sensations in the chest) were more typical of a larger pneumothorax.

After being discharged, I had 2 more appointments with the pulmonologist to perform a breathing test and go over my results. All clear, no concerns. AFAIK the hospital still hasn't uploaded the CTs or x-rays to the medical portal yet so :/

Since then, I occasionally experience chest pain in the same general area and at one point it was intense enough that I considered going to the ER again (it faded eventually but still concerned me). Occasional chest pain isn't anything *new* to me, per se, and it typically resolves within half an hour, but, well. I've been worrying that the pneumothorax may not have totally resolved, especially since both times it was apparently too small to be noticed on the initial x-rays and was only spotted on the CT but I was discharged based on my x-rays. So, like, am I being paranoid or is there more validity to my concern? I've been freaked out enough by the incidents that even sneezing too hard makes me worry that I'll pop a lung again.",1,"period, chest pain, ##ling sensations, chest"
"Our son is 8 (no diagnosed health conditions) . He's very clearly had ADHD (inattentive) since kindergarten but we've tried helping him keep up in school with reading intervention, speech, resource, and tutoring. But he's steadily falling more behind. We had a meeting with the psychologist, speech therapist, reading interventionist, resource teacher, school nurse, and his teacher after they did a full psychoeducational evaluation.
He now officially qualifies for special education and is, across the board, testing at mid first grade level. He's currently in his last month of second grade. All of the evaluations say his inability to focus is the biggest issue.
I convinced my husband that we explore all options, including the medical route with an official ADHD diagnosis. He agreed. But now that we discuss medication, he has a hard "" I'm not drugging my kid"" and
""we aren't putting him on speed"". I've told him there are non-stimulant options available now. But he's still holding firm that drugs are the lazy way out of something we can fix on our own. The only suggestion he's provided for fixing it on our own is to provide him with a better study environment (which I already do by completely clearing the counter, moving the other spinning chairs, asking his sister to hang out in the other room, eliminating all noise, and making sure he's not hungry), but even with this, he can focus for about 30 seconds.

Some specific concerns he's expressed are the impact of drugs (we are looking at Strattera and Intuniv) on a developing brain and nervous system and general distrust of the American pharmaceutical industry not having the best interest of people. I've showed him that the EU, Australia, and Japan have all approved Strattera and Intuniv for use in children.

We have an appt with his pediatrician tomorrow to discuss medication options. But I know he will just dismiss it all and say a pediatrician isn't knowledgeable enough on long term impacts on the brain. So I was hoping to get some input from other doctors who maybe have more experience with the long term neurological/nervous system impact of non-stimulant meds on children.

Onto the issue... About 6 weeks ago, I began to experience intermittent pain [above my left testicle](https://imgur.com/a/BL6FPry). The pain gradually worsened, saw a general practitioner, physical examination showed minor swelling in the mentioned area; doctor assumed epidytimitis although urinalysis came back negative. Was given levofloxacin, took for ten days. Before I had taken the antibiotics, I masturbated, and within 30 minutes began to experience much more pain, have not masturbated since and it's been a little over 2 weeks. Antibiotics seemed to decrease frequency of pain, but not by much. On the 7th dose, pain suddenly became significantly worse, maybe a 5 out of 10 for 4 hours. I personally believe my vericoseal was acting up simultaneously with an infection. The pain continued to return, seemingly at random and stayed around a 5 out of 10. Out of concern and suggestion of a nurse triage I went to the ER for an ultrasound and urinalysis; the only thing mentioned was the confirmation of the vericoseal. I believe this was 3 days ago, it's all been kind of a blur. Since then, the pain has continued to come and go. But yesterday I had become sexually excited but didn't engage in any kind of physical stimulation. Not long after, I experienced symptoms of a UTI. Slight stinging and burning pain at the tip of my penis and a near constant uncontrollable urge to urinate. This passed after about 5 hours. Throughout the entirety of this situation urinating has also been a bit strange. There is almost always a slight physical hesitation before I urinate, occasionally the stream briefly gets cut off before continuing. Shortly afterwards there seems to be some automatic internal contraction that tries to push out a bit more urine, which as far as I've noticed urine hasn't come out unless I'm on the toilet. The appearance of the urine is normal in color, but is occasionally cloudy, and almost always has tiny bubbles that float below the surface tension of the water. Also occasionally there are stringy bits which I assume are small amounts of sperm produced when I become excited that is pushed out during urination. One time, about 2 weeks ago I had found a small yellowish/tan-ish clump of a gooey sticky substance about the size of... well, maybe halfway between a pea and an olive which appeared to be sperm. Not sure if I should be concerned with the size or the color; when I've brought up a lot of these symptoms the doctors essentially just go ""ah, okay"" and then move on.
Currently dealing with a slight ache (1 out of 10) and there is always a difficult to describe feeling of discomfort through this whole thing.

I have a habit of masturbating once or twice a day; this is the longest of gone without it for many many years. Could this be causing some discomfort or pain? I daily get sexually excited despite not engaging in any physical activity.
Should I assume this is just an unfortunately long period of an agitated vericoseal?
...Can I masturbate? Would it cause more pain or perhaps worsen or accelerate another issue?

I've lost my appetite, I'm sleeping poorly, had a panic attack bad enough that I went to the ER a time aside from the one I mentioned before. I'm physically, mentally and emotionally drained. Any input or help would be appreciated beyond words I could use in the English language.

Thanks in advance.",1,"c, ve"
"When I was around 5 or 6 years old, I got ""diagnosed"" with ADHD. There was no proper evaluation, just my mother's word. However, this was also back in the early 2000s, so I'm not sure if evaluations were done. I have documents printed out of every single time I visited the doctor, why I was there, notes about my health, and when my mother called asking to change my medication or to increase the MG. These medications include STRATTERA 40 MG, FOCALIN XR 20 MG, CONCERTA 36 MG, and LEXAPRO 10 MG. Each prescription contained 30 pills. Looking back at my childhood, it's pretty much a blur. It's hard for me to recall certain events or names of my teachers. The years I spent on medication put me in a zombie like, autopilot state. I've done some research and I've learned that mixing these medications can lead to some issues.. I have been struggling with high blood pressure since I was 22 years old. I'm 27 now and every single day for almost 10 years, I'm constantly at war in my own head when it comes to doing something so simple. Basic day to day things have become such a challenge for me because it's so hard for me to find the motivation. I looked up what can happen when these medications are mixed, and this is what came up.  
  
Focalin+Lexapro: Escitalopram increases serotonergic activity in the CNS via inhibition of serotonin re-uptake by serotonin transporter proteins (SERT) The combination of escitalopram with other medications that increase serotonergic activity has been reported to result in the development of serotonin syndrome. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include autonomic instability, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and significant changes to mental status.  
  
Lexapro+Strattera: The subject drug is a CYP2D6 inhibitor and atomoxetine is metabolized by CYP2D6. Concomitant administration will reduce the metabolism of atomoxetine, increasing serum concentrations, as well as the risk and severity of adverse effects.  
  
Concerta+Focalin: Concurrent use of drugs known to increase blood pressure is expected to result in an increased risk for supine hypertension. Closely monitor the patient for elevated blood pressure (including in supine and head-elevated positions) and for any evidence of toxicity.  
  
Strattera+Focalin: Concurrent use of drugs known to increase blood pressure is expected to result in an increased risk for supine hypertension. Closely monitor the patient for elevated blood pressure (including in supine and head-elevated positions) and for any evidence of toxicity.  
  
  
  
I can't help but to wonder if the cocktail of medication I was taking as a child could have led to my day to day issues I deal with now as an adult.. What pediatrician would do this to a child with no proper evaluation? And YES, that doctor is still seeing kids as I'm typing this. I know there is probably a statue of limitations that apply considering it's been years, but I feel like I deserve answers because regardless of why I am the way I am now, my childhood was taken from me due to being overly medicated. My mother got exactly what she wanted. She didn't want to deal with me, so she reported to this doctor how I was an ""out of control problem child"" and he listened..  
  
Could I take him to court for something like emotional distress? Would an attorney even take this case since this happened years ago?

"Looking for advice on how to handle a sudden onset of severe hand and arm pain. I’m on mobile so apologies for any weird formatting. 

31F. Regular medications: 100mg atomoxetine/strattera for ADHD, birth control. I also take Vitamin D, iron, and a Vitamin B complex daily. 

Woke up around 11:30 PM Sunday night after going to be around 9:45 PM with severe pain in my left hand (non-dominant). The pain was so intense that it woke me up. I got out of bed to take some OTC medicine - 1000mg of acetaminophen and 400mg of ibuprofen. After about 45min, the pain was still very intense so I took additional medication - 5mg cyclobenzaprine - thinking I may be experiencing a muscle spasm. Another 45min pass and around 1 AM I am still awake and now crying from the pain and I take a hydrocodone-acetaminophen 5-325mg. After about 15min the pain subsides enough that I am able to sleep. On Monday morning I took another round of 400mg ibuprofen to try and get through the work day (desk job, WFH). About two hours later I am still in pretty intense pain and take 7.5mg meloxicam. I continued to take 200mg ibuprofen every five hours after this to stave off the pain enough to get through the day. With the pain managed, I noticed that it isn’t isolated to my hand and is in my entire left arm, starting at the shoulder blade, though it is most intense in my hand. I took another hydrocodone-acetaminophen last night to help me sleep. Heat also seems to help the pain - I was able to take a hot shower yesterday and that did seem to help alleviate the pain. 

I currently have my left hand/wrist in a cock-up style splint to keep me from using it too much. Flexing the muscles in my hand exacerbates the pain. So far I’ve been able to get through work today with 600mg ibuprofen every 6 hours but this only takes the edge off. Occasionally I will get a burst of pain in my left hand and stops me in my tracks while I bear it for a few seconds before passing. I have had no other symptoms in my left arm/hand before this. Any thoughts on what this could be? Due to the sudden onset and lack of previous symptoms I believe I have a pinched nerve but my research says it could also be acute onset carpal tunnel. Please help, I need advice.",1,carpal tunnel
"I am a 23-year-old white cisgender female, 5' 5"" 170 lbs with autism spectrum disorder and ADHD. I do take medication for ADHD and Autism (SNRIs & NRIs, will list med list at bottom) along with hormonal birth control, I don't do any recreational drugs and dislike the taste of alcohol. For as long as I can remember I don't really handle heat very well, which temperature regulation is something autistics like myself struggle with. However summer of 2023 is when it got really bad to the point of being desperate enough to go to my GP, she was new (like fresh out of med school new) and thought it was due to the oral antifungal a podiatrist gave me to treat athlete's foot despite the fact I stopped taking it. She kept hyper-focusing on my excessive sweating, which is a byproduct of my heat intolerance. On my first visit with her she gave me drysol, my second visit with her after being unhappy with the results she gave me glycopyrrolate 1MG saying ""it might treat the heat intolerance"". It did not, in fact it worsened my heat intolerance due to my body being dried out to prevent sweating and unable to cool myself. I obviously no longer take that medication. Needless to say I will not longer see her at all, I had to demand she give me a blood test to rule out thyroid issues as I have family history on both sides of my family.

I went to my naturopath for a second opinion and she thought I may have POTS due to my heart rate rising 10-20 beats when I go from sitting to standing up. Also did a more in-depth blood test with naturopath and discovered I have low iron levels (holy shit how did my ex-GP miss this), taking iron and B12 supplements currently. Naturopath sent me a referral for a cardiologist, and the one I saw scheduled tests to rule everything else out. Wore a Zio heart monitor for a week (they are processing my data currently), have an EKG and tilt table test scheduled for later this year. Cardiologist does not think my heat intolerance is a POTS issue despite much medical research and patients with POTS reporting heat intolerance as a symptom. I am going to do a hormone test with my naturopath to rule out anything from the thyroid just in case, but I feel confident I have POTS. I did have COVID-19 in summer of 2022 and had a post-viral cough that only went away after getting an inhaler many months later.

Just unloading my dishwasher leaves me absolutely sweating profusely. Major temperature changes makes me sweat; going from cold \~30 outside to warm \~60 inside makes me sweat. Cold water makes me feel hot and sweat, I pretty much have to have a fan on me when I'm in my bedroom to preemptively control my own body temp before I become hot. My bathroom is small and thus have to turn on fan to keep myself cool when doing my business. My heartrate rising when standing up consitently go up, however I have never experienced dizzyness nor fainting spells. My heat intolerance tends to be mostly localized to my face/head and my whole body sweats as a reaction. I take much longer to cool down when I feel hot, I take literally an entire hour or more to cool down enough. Experiencing heat intolerance and the excessive sweating is absolutely disregulating as an autistic person and can cause a meltdown if the sweating/heat intolerance worsens. So I ask the qualified doctors of reddit if I do have POTS based on my experiences. Or other conditions/triggers I might have instead.

"Considering I have nowhere else to ask:

A little background: 

30F, white, \~140lb, 5'9"" moderate-heavy exercise (5-7xs per week at least an 1h+ a day), BP naturally on the lower end (103/60 or so).  I do not smoke or use any drugs, nor do I drink, current prescriptions are lexapro 20mg and strattera 60mg  (I'm in vet school, gotta focus)

Tried talking to my GP about headrushes and my limbs easily falling asleep probably about 5 years ago now (not much has changed except for age) and got waved off as it not being an issue as my blood pressure is on the lower end and that it was just due to position change and not to worry.  Well, I guess I'm starting to worry because these headrushes come so often, I'm used to them.  My limbs fall asleep so easily that almost every night I know I need to put my arms to my side and then I literally feel the blood rush back to my fingers.  But the headrushes have me concerned.  

I am very hydrated and focus on getting salt and electrolytes in my diet, I will admit sometimes I don't eat a whole lot in the middle of the day, but I tend to snack a lot and definitely get my dinner and breakfast in.  Nonetheless, this issue has persisted even with snacks, so there has not been a change whether my stomach is empty or not (and sometimes it's worse after a meal)

Headrushes occur after I change position, such as getting up from lying down or standing after sitting making me suspect orthostatic hypotension and again I wouldn't be too worried if this were occasional, but it is probably up to 10 times a day!  I stand, my vision blurs, I forget where I am.  I know where to catch myself to rest against a wall and sometimes my body tremors, like little neurological ""zaps"" until it catches up.  Sometimes I lose my hearing, and if I don't have a wall nearby, I've mastered slowly sitting down before I fall.  The episodes last from a few seconds to about a minute long.  Some are more mild where I can be dizzy, but not need a wall and somehow walk pretending my vision is straight and I'm fine, when in fact, everything is gray and hazy and sound is echoey. Sometimes it's severe like yesterday when I stood up and fell on the wall near a friend and she asked if I was okay as my body started to tremor.  In the end I was like: ""yeah, it happens a bit often"" and she seemed concerned.  So here I am, asking the Doctors of Reddit: should I be concerned?  Is this normal? Should I get some tests done or something?  Any possible differential diagnoses? Or any other tidbits you can offer to make me feel not completely out of my mind?",1,
"32F, 250lbs, | current medications: strattera 10mg, hyrdoxyzine 10mg | non-smoker | Dx: PCOS, ADHD, ASD. | Gallbladder removal in 2016 | Right ovarian and pelvic pain since 3 days ago. Increasing in frequency and pain level.

&#x200B;

Hi, so I have PCOS and I've had this large ovarian cyst (4.2cm at it's largest) bugging me for at least 3 years now where every few months I end up in the ER from very sharp pain (8-9 on the scale, using my gallbladder pain that resulted in emergency surgery and a week in the hospital as a reference for a 10) It always results in getting pain meds, discharged, and referred to an OBGYN that kind of gives me the ""you have PCOS, what are you expecting me to do? Cysts are part of the package"" and sends me home. Half of them don't even look at an ultrasound before doing so.  
I've been bleeding very suddenly, painfully, and very liquid over the past 3 days or so. Given the PCOS, I assumed a particularly painful period at first even though I'd just finished a week long period a couple of days prior to this starting.  
I went to the ER last night. Pain started at about 7.5 and was at 9 within the hour. I was discharged after ""all my scans and bloodwork looked normal"" I had to ask if anything at all was noted on my right ovary where I was feeling all the pain and was told about the cyst but that I should just follow up with my OBGYN as soon as possible.  
I made an appointment today but their soonest availability isn't for a couple of weeks.  
The meds last night at the hospital kept the pain down for about 2-3 hours but then I was up throughout the night with a lot of discomfort and some shooting pain (around a 3-4 on pain scale)  
I took some CBD for pain as soon as I woke up today around noon and then 2 Excedrin around 1:30 when I ate. Also for the pain and migraine I woke up with.  
It's now around 4:30pm and I'm having sudden pain again just like yesterdays where it's also hurting my pelvis bone to where I feel like something is tearing me from the inside. I started at about a 6.5 20min ago and am now at a 7.  
I want to explore a surgical option for the cyst when I go to the OBGYN but don't know if it's worth it to go to the ER again when I was just there yesterday. I don't want to come off as a pain med seeker or anything (my husband works in the ER and has mentioned their ""frequent flyers"" before) but also I remember after the first time my gallstones were diagnosed, I was holding off until my surgical consultation until I ended up in the ER two nights in a row right before said consultation, at which point the doctor scolded me a bit for not coming in sooner because I now had stones blocking my common bile duct and would need a procedure before the surgery and I was there for a week total for what should've originally been a relatively quick outpatient procedure.  
For extra reference, I have a high pain tolerance (runs in my family. It once took me 3 months to realize I had fractured my foot) as well as ASD so I'm not always sure when the right time to defy  instrucctions from an ER  of holding off to see a specialist is.  
If I'm just going to get pain meds and send me home again, I know I can manage my pain at home one way or another even if through tears. But if there's a chance a second visit so quickly is indicative that this needs a closer look sooner than later or I can at least get a OBGYN consultation while I'm there then it's worth the poking and prodding (I have tricky veins. Also runs in my family)  
The rules said to be as detailed as possible so I hope this wasn't somehow too detailed. It seems like a long post.  
TIA !",1,right

Hey Dr.'s of Reddit
I've been experiencing intermittent heart pains / cramps for a while.  Sometimes accompanied by a burning sensation throughout my whole heart region,  sometimes with pain that extends to one arm or the other.  It's not heartburn, I know that pain. It's not palpation, I have those too. They also don't seem to be associated with an increase heart rate. 

The week after Christmas we went on a week long roadtrip to a very high elevation area (from 200ft above sea-level to 6500ft above sea-level) where I had this episodes almost daily and really bad. They are not associated with exercise,  and actually seem to happen more while at rest than when moving. 

In the last 2 days,  I've been getting dizzy while walking around normal.  Not in remain to standing up, I've already been up for a while,  then get a rush of dizzy like I stood up too fast.  

If I go to the ER while NOT feeling these chest pains, could the testing detect anything or would I just be told to come back when symptomatic? I really don't want to waste anyone's time, but these symptoms are fairly concerning...",1,"heart pains, ##ram, burning, dizzy, dizzy"

For some background, I (F24) was recently diagnosed with ADHD about three months ago. (I also have anxiety and depression stemming from childhood ptsd being treated with 10mg lexapro). Since then I have tried Strattera and Qelbree (both at varying doses). I noticed a minimal improvement for the first 2-3 days on strattera and nothing on qelbree. So, I started adderall 20mg XR yesterday and I have such mixed feelings. 

After two days of being on the new medication, I feel like it is a little easier to keep my momentum and I’ve noticed a huge difference in my ability to coach myself through moments of anxiety, paralysis, etc. This has been huge for starting tasks or identifying emotions. Also, I feel like for the first time ever I can think in my head. I know that sounds silly, but I’ve always needed to be an external processor and have never been able to engage in deep, critical thinking quietly.  So, I feel like it is definitely working to an extent! 

I was really hoping it would lift my constant brain fog/haziness that started about a month ago. I think it helped some, but I still really noticed it will driving and trying to relax. It’s similar to DPDR, but more physical than mental. 

The problem is that I feel like it has almost exasperated some symptoms, like inattention. I find myself talking more, getting side tracked, and having more “oh squirrel!” moments if you know what I mean. Also, my anxiety is through the roof since starting the med. I’m able to control the thoughts once they start but I’m noticing a huge increase in the frequency and the physical manifestations (nausea, loud heart beat/feel like it’s racing but isn’t, etc). I’m really struggling to eat (which is odd considering I normally struggle not to). I don’t mean forgetting to eat, but even when I try to force myself I can only manage a few bites. And the worst is that I couldn’t sleep last night. I mean I got 2 hours between 9:30pm and 9am. Surprisingly, thanks to the adderall I’m sure, I don’t feel horrible. But normally by now I would be ready to wind down and I feel like I could go for another 10 hours mentally, even though physically I am tired. 

I’m worried because I feel like I almost need a higher dose eventually to treat the ADHD but I certainly cannot go longer than a few days with side effects this disruptive to my daily life. I have a lengthy family history of Bipolar and BPD, so the lack of sleep is really concerning. (I’m very cognizant of the likelihood I develop one of these, and this little sleep and appetite screams manic episode to me). 

So, since it’s now the weekend (my doctor was closed today too) and I’m not going to be able to speak to him until Monday, I was hoping for some guidance on if I should continue taking my 20 mg adderall xr through the weekend if my symptoms continue? I know going off meds suddenly can be bad too. 

Is there any possibility that change in dosage would make a difference? Or maybe an increase in lexapro? (We are planning to increase anyways to better manage anxiety/depression stemming from childhood ptsd once we figured out the right adhd med)

I apologize if this is too long-winded I just wanted to try and clearly explain how my side effects were manifesting. Thank you in advance to anyone who offers an opinion or advice, I don’t really know what to do here. I welcome others who have taken adderall to share their experiences too if you think it could be beneficial. :) 

To clarify- I will speak to my doctor regardless on Monday! I just want to know what to do for the next 2 days (well and Monday morning too). ",1,ad
"\[26F, 5'8"", 210lb, caucasian, complaint of medications/dx, duration: a few weeks, existing dx: (ADD, PTSD, depression, anxiety, migraine), current meds: (imitrex 100mg PRN, ondansetron 4mg PRN, Emgality for migraine, can't remember dosage), I do not drink/smoke or use recreational drugs.\]

So, I don't really know where to go for this and I am really stressing out about all of this. I just need some insight and maybe some advice on what I should do next.  
I was diagnosed years ago with PTSD, and within that, both anxiety and depression. They are linked for sure. Much later, those dx still stand, and about a year and a half ago I was also dx with ADD, inattentive type, which honestly I think was mostly adult onset... or it doubled in severity at the very least.  
I've been on lexapro, sertraline, amytriptaline, wellbutrin, and others that at this point I don't even recall. They were all... okay. They leveled out my mood swings but I was still miserable mostly. That's it,  aside from minor side effects. I'm no longer taking any of them because the benefit just wasn't enough.  
Then I finally got dx with ADD, and I was on Adderall for a while. It definitely helped with my concentration, brain fog, motivation, and racing thoughts.... you name it. I even slept better at night. It just didn't last long enough and I would get a racing heart pretty often, so I wanted to try something else, but I moved away from the psyciatrist, NP, that was helping me with that dx.  
I made an appointment with a DO at a behavioral health clinic, and waited months to get in. I was really really excited for this appointment because I thought finally I could get back on a medication for ADD and stop being in such a mental hell every day. I really wanted to try Vyvanse, because it helped both my mom and my sister a lot.  
During the appointment, the DO stated that she didn't think that I had PTSD (which I find rather offensive?), and she also told me that she thought the ADD wasn't primarily the issue, but that anxiety and depression were. She gave me three medication choices: venlafaxine, strattera, and guanfacine. She recommended the venlafaxine.  
I looked up the medications and they all just seem kind of scary. Any IRL person I've talked to that has been on venlafaxine has told me to stay away from it, because the withdrawal symptoms are so bad. I asked the DO about this later and she told me that she does not believe the medication has bad withdrawal symptoms, or that it is highly addictive, but with a simple google search you can see that venlafaxine is one of the hardest depression meds to wean off of. Why would she lie about that?  
Strattera seems to have a lowish rate of actually working, and guanfacine would lower my blood pressure, and long use can have some pretty nasty side-effects.  
This is all giving me a whole lot of anxiety and my mood has just tanked. I've been trying not to break down. I've been absolutely desperate to just be on something so I can think clearly, or even get my words out in a full sentence, since I tend to speak pretty brokenly when the brain fog gets really bad.  
Can anyone give me some advice on what I should do? Or even some encouragement? I'm at a loss and I feel a bit beaten. Thanks in advance.",1,heart

Occasional difficulty/delayed? swallowing, ie a 1"" long vitamin capsule or a particularly large bolus/bite of food. Appetite seems to be more normal at night but still not quite right. 

Initially I thought it was psychosomatic, related to work stress from my previous job but it hasn't really improved in spite of switching to a new and much better work environment. Timing of my ADHD meds doesn't seem to make a difference either, and I didn't have any appetite issues when I first started with Concerta to begin with. I've also been on different ADHD meds (Strattera, Adderall) and did not have any appetite related side effects with them either.

I have prior imaging: 

*May 2023 CT AP w/ IV contrast, no oral - incidentaloma of hiatal hernia per rad report, scan was after a car accident with bruising and RLQ tenderness from the seatbelt) and

I'm an MRI tech and was able to go over it with my favorite body radiologist afterwards so I'm not worried about anything having been missed or anything, but I moved for a new job and the CT was not with my current employer so I don't have that perk to take advantage of anymore.

Current medications: Vyvanse, amlodipine

I got my ADD diagnosis rather late in life, starting at around 30, and I've been on several different medications over the years, including Strattera, Adderall, Ritalin, and now Vyvanse. And every single one of them has given me the exact same side effect; namely, a stiff, sometimes tingly feeling in my knees. Occasionally my elbows too, but mostly and most prominently my knees.

For the most part, it's not debilitating. But it is consistent. But I haven't seen anything like it on lists of common side effects for these medications, Google is unhelpful, and none of my ADD-having friends have ever experienced anything like it, and when I mentioned it to my psychiatrist, she'd never heard of anything like it before.

A suggestion for something that could be the cause of this would be wonderful, but to be honest, I'd be almost as happy to hear an anecdote of you or somebody you've known, been acquainted with, and/or heard of that's experienced something similar before, just so I could have the peace of mind of knowing that this is not something I should be especially worried about.",1,"stiff,, tingly feeling in, knees"
"Hey there! Im a 22F, ive been diagnosed qith adhd last year, and was prescribed with strattera 7 months ago (80mg). My doc changed my meds to Vyvanse (30mg) because Im really struggling with concentration and task initiation. Strattera did me good, i discovered a new self, but im a college student, already doing an extra year cause i fell behind bc of my struggles. Now the thing is, he told me to slowly stop strattera, decreasing the doses and then start vyvanse. So following my schedule, i already finished a week taking 60mg and tomorrow i should start 40mg, but i am also on finals week and i dont wanna mess up another exam round, could i start vyvanse with the lowest strattera dose tomorrow?

I dont think ther should be any problems but i just wanna make sure. Im mostly concerned about the heart rate, maybe i could take vyvanse in the morning and strattera at night?

Extreme nausea to the point where I can’t even stand up without wanting to vomit, loss of appetite which I was warned about but oddly enough my biggest issue is the horrible and thick aftertaste on my tongue. I tried drinking water, brushing my teeth ( including tongue, roof or my mouth, cheeks,etc), and salt water rinse. I can work with nausea but I can’t have a horrible taste in my mouth 24/7. I was just diagnosed with ADHD inattentive type and this is my first time taking medication for it I really want it to work my life has gone downhill due to me mental health. However I’m not about to keep taking it if I can’t eat or drink anything without it tasting absolutely disgusting. It did make me sleep for a while but I actually liked that it was the first time in years I went to sleep easily.

Should I stop taking it since I only had one dose? I have another meeting with my doctor in 2 weeks to go over everything but I can’t go two weeks like this. Is there any permanent solution to the thick and bad taste feeling in my mouth? Possible medication I can ask my doctor about?",1,"loss, thick aftertaste on, horrible taste, bad taste feeling in"
"Age and Gender: 20 AFAB nonbinary 
Medical history: POTS, hEDS, possible IBS, GAD, depression, autism, ADHD, ARFID (currently recovered), keratosis pilaris, Gilbert’s syndrome
Medications: Strattera 40 mg, Klonopin 0.5 mg, Syeda, Lexapro 20 mg, D3 supplement, midodrine 20-40 mg daily depending on symptoms 

Complaint: I am SO ITCHY. It started when my psychiatrist upped my Strattera dose from 40 mg to 60 mg; on her orders I’m back down at 40 (for some reason, as it doesn’t even help my adhd), but the itching is only getting worse. At first, it was kind of a normal but insistent skin itch that would go away with scratching. Now, it feels like it’s deeper, like it’s down in my bones, and scratching doesn’t provide any relief. There’s no rash or anything, I just washed my entire bedspread, and there’s no evidence of bugs on my skin or in my living space. 

It gets worse at night; last night I had to apply several coats of Biofreeze to my entire right arm just to numb the whole limb so I could SLEEP. It does seem to be worse on my arms and hands and on the right side of my body, but I’m worried that it’s spreading because now my ankle also has the unscratchable itch. It also occurs on my head and face, legs, and torso so… pretty much everywhere. Just not as often. It’s been a week and I’m already at my wit’s end with being covered in scratches and constantly itching in a new location. 

Things that help: Biofreeze, a LOT of it. I have some hydroxyzine left over from when I used to use it for anxiety and my psychiatrist is having me try that to see if it helps; will update if it does or doesn’t. 
Things that don’t help: Scratching but I can’t just sit there and itch without trying to fix it, regular lotion, and calamine lotion. 

My psychiatrist has ordered a comprehensive metabolic panel especially to check my liver, as I have Gilbert’s inherited from my dad’s side. I’m not jaundiced but would love to hear if anyone thinks it’s my liver so I know to act faster. 

Please help me figure this out and tell me how to get rid of it! I will answer any questions anyone has in the comments",1,
"22F 140lbs 5’3. Medications and diagnoses listed below. 

Hello, my whole life I have been praised for my smooth speech and professional sounding vocabulary. Basically since I was able to talk. I have also historically been very good with my fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Over the last few months though I’ve started stuttering and dropping/throwing stuff entirely on accident and without warning—and it’s down exceptionally bad within the last 3 weeks. Almost every sentence I’m stuttering and I’ve dropped my phone and keys 4 times  already today if not more. 

I am currently taking a host of medications, including: 300mg xr lamictal, 50mg trazodone, 10mg leucovorin, 1mg folic acid, 80mg strattera, and I also have the BC implant. Until January I was only taking the lamictal and leucovorin but I finally found a doctor who was willing to help me with my reported issues. I am diagnosed with epilepsy, a rare gene mutation (pol-g related, Main symptom is chronic fatigue), primary insomnia, ADHD, and suspected PTSD (dr said he didn’t want to diagnose given the setting but wanted me to follow up with a psychiatrist). Also probably unrelated but a little over a week ago I had a sudden-onset throat ache that was a 6/10 pain level for a day, my tongue also achd, and the lymph nodes in my neck have been hard since then though the pain has left. 

I’m stressed out because i feel like my brain and body are deteriorating right in front of me. Please let me know what’s going on.",1,"primary, ##omnia, adhd, ptsd, throat ache, achd"
"Hi everyone!

*(This is my first time posting here so lmk if I missed out on any essential info!)*

Height - 5'7""

Drink/smoke/drugs - No

I'm 18F,Indian and have been having some kind of ""episodes"" lately. It started with my hands shaking randomly and moved to having trouble breathing and a panic attack type of situation. I've not had a very good relation with my mental health since I was 13 because of lots of bullying, anxiety, self-harm and all of that. I finally consulted a therapist online in secret when I was 16 and she suggested me butterfly hugs to calm myself down in that instant and to see a psychiatrist as soon as I could. 

I finally plucked up the courage to tell my parents about what I've been experiencing all these years but they didn't even bother to look at my face while I was talking and just told me to not think too much. I've learnt to be alone and get over things by crying and excessive sleeping so as to function ""normally"". I was a suicidal kid and used to self-harm but I educated myself growing up and forced myself to quit harming. I haven't made a cut in 2.5 years. I don't really know how to describe 5 years worth of trauma in a single post but I've tried all my options. I've talked to some elders, all my friends but none of them had a good solution. I live in an area that doesn't have medical care facilities in terms of psychiatrists or therapists and come from a very,very strict family.

I don't look forward to waking up each day and somehow I know that if I don't, it'll be okay. I don't feel like a person anymore. All my friends who know my story (3-4 ig because i'm not that extroverted) tell me they feel sad and worried for me and that my situation is one of the most toxic and helpless ones they've seen. I thought recently that I should get zoloft or strattera if I can because I can't push my thoughts away anymore. I don't want to feel anything, it's a lot.

&#x200B;

A bit of background about recent events :-

I want to be a doctor myself and recently got accepted into med school in a diff country as well but my parents told me to suck it up and stay in my country. I put like months worth of research but they didn't bother to even look up the uni and just told me that it's not all rosy. The self-doubt, guilt and the sheer sadness of being denied an opportunity again is very deabilitating. I don't know if what I'm doing is right. 

P.s. - My dms are open as well.",1,
"So I have in my entire adult life always been tired and without energy, but it has escalated with age (late thirties now). **I'm going to meet a new doctor in three weeks time, and I was hoping to get some help from here what I should ask for.**

I can not maintain a set schedule for my daily life and unable to work. A typical cycle looks as following: Sleep 8-12 hours, awake 2-6 hours, sleep 2-4 hours, awake 2-6 hours, sleep 2-4 hours, awake 2-6 hours and then it starts over.  And when I am awake I got less energy than a cold stone. I have looked for help before and have gotten medication to help me fall asleep (never have problems with this, fall asleep within minutes always), and to help me stay awake. First off the medication don't really work and I can fall asleep even after drinking lots of coffee and taking prescribed stimulants. Only things that work is that someone forcefully keep me awake in person, but within 1-2 weeks I get physically ill and bed ridden (headaches that make my migraine feel like a warm summer breeze, and it is not horton's even though I do want to kill myself when it hits).

I was recently diagnosed with adhd and autism, and was hoping that adhd medication would help, but it did not. I have also had chronic headaches since 2006 that I have had 3 different neurologists trying to diagnose without luck, but most things point to it having psychosomatic origins. They have taken more blood from me for testing than I thought I would produce in a life time, they have done full body CT-scan and MRI on my head without showing anything outside of the ordinary.

I don't exercise because I am so tired, though I have done that in the past without any noticeable difference in my energy levels. I need to have a personal trainer to spur me on, but without being able to make plans without forcing myself to stay awake which makes me physically ill, yeah.....

So any tips regarding for what I should tell my new doctor would be appreciated. Live long and prosper.

I’ve also had problems with my ears since mid-2019: my tinnitus has got worse, my ears click when I swallow, often feel blocked and I get regular mild earache.

"What's up, docs? I am 22 going on 23, and less than a month ago was diagnosed with moderate ADHD, combined presentation. I had been wondering for awhile, because I am also autistic(diagnosed @ age 13) and while executive dysfunction is a symptom of ASD looking back at my life and where I am currently:failed probation at a couple EMT jobs due to not remembering things, constantly messy room,piled up laundry, restarting college from scratch due to several of semesters of withdrawals plus academic probation, to name a few. I had an IEP in high school that had some accommodations(extra test time, taking it in a separate room,etc) but I barely graduated and even repeated 11th grade English. 

I was all but officially diagnosed at age 8, as back then I was showing all the signs(procrastination, disorganization, failure to initiate/finish tasks, hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention) but it was put on my health summary. The reason being is my mom didn't want treatment(i.e. medication because she as she puts it now she didn't want me becoming addicted or it messing up my brain later in life by giving me Parkinson's or something. She is a registered nurse, working as a home health case manager. But she definitely misunderstands my conditions at times(says that me being high functioning means I am barely autistic etc). 

When I showed her my Strattera when I picked it up, she reacted as if I had shown her crack. She nearly ripped it out of my hands and went on about how it noted suicidal thoughts or liver damage as possible side effects, and even brought up me needing to just go back to church, or that I should only get therapy. She also said she doesn't believe one should ever take medication for mental health reasons if it isn't something like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. This may come from how my sister didn't respond well to antidepressants(weight gain and messing up her mood).

 I have no allergies to any drugs or foods, my EKG screening came back good, and currently have been taking Strattera for nearly 4 weeks, first week 1 10mg capsule per day, now 2. Might be slightly working, but no ill effects as far as I can tell. I have a follow up this Friday with my psychiatrist.

Does my mom have a point, or is she overreacting?",1,"executive, suicidal thoughts, liver damage"

Are antidepressants more likely to cause apathy in someone who has bipolar?

Also if I had apathy from other antidepressants like luvox, does it mean drugs like Strattera or Qelbree , what I am planning to use for my ADHD, may also cause apathy since they also increase serotonin?",1,"apathy, apathy, apathy"
"posting from a burner account … but since april i’ve gained almost 40lbs with no explanation. 
at first i thought it was because of my medication (hydroxyzine), since i started taking it regularly in april, but i stopped taking that along with all other medications (lamictal, strattera, wellbutrin) about a month ago and am still just as big. i’m absolutely ashamed and embarrassed by it and am so scared it’s due to something wrong with me. 
i got blood work done in april, and it all came back perfectly normal. 
i don’t even know what to do about this i’m just horrified by the state of my body.

"I am a 31 year old woman who has been working on treating some mental health issues. Almost two weeks ago, I started seeing a new psychiatrist. I was prescribed 18 mg of Strattera for ADHD and my dose of Zoloft was increased from  100 mg to 125 mg. After a few days my mood absolutely tanked and I couldn’t sleep. I even went to the ER because I couldn’t stop shaking. On the advice of that doctor I stopped taking the Strattera and returned to my original dose of Zoloft. My sleep has not returned to normal and now since last night every time I try to sleep something in my body will twitch any time I get close to falling asleep. This is a nightmare for me.

Kinda sounds like a dumb question.

I was in the ER a few weeks ago for chest pain, tachycardia, unusual bruising on my body, trouble breathing, and heart palpitations.

I stayed the whole night and they didn’t know why my heart rate was so high but they were only able to get it down to 130/? before they left me go. 
I was taking Strattera 60 mg(atomoxitine) at that time for my adhd. This medication is a non stimulant. I would take it once in the morning. I’ve recently been put on Concerta 18mg (methylphenidate). I’ve been on it for almost 2 weeks. 
Anyways, the reason I’m writing this is because I’ve been vomiting a lot mostly in the mornings. I think what triggers it is the new med I’m taking which is the Concerta. I understand that it’s a normal side effect so I’m not concerned about it. The thing is that I’ve been vomiting up some blood for a few days now and idk why or what that means. 
Please help?",1,"chest pain, tachycardia, unusual bruising on, trouble breathing, heart palpitations, ##ing up, blood"
"I am a 24m in engineering school. Was diagnosed at 21 and started medication immediately. Started on concerta and felt like I was shot by tranquilizer darts as it put me to sleep. Switched to strattera and ended up on 60mg. Everything in life improved, except my academic performance. I believe this to be because strattera prevents me from stressing myself out enough to rely on adrenaline to focus (deadline rush is how I managed to get a 4.10 in high school).

&#x200B;

Doc decided to try adderall xr in combination with the strattera. I started 10mg and am now at 20mg. Adderall seems to be the right medication for me as it has improved my quality of life even more than strattera alone.

&#x200B;

However, college work is still a struggle. I sit down to do work and my brain is searching for 1000 ways to escape from the existential dread of schoolwork. I assume this is because school is the least stimulating activity to me personally, and ADHD does not bode well with lack of stimulation. I am much more calm and patient with many other activities, including; hobbies, cleaning, work, interpersonal relationships, etc.

&#x200B;

One last thing to add: I am afraid of asking for dosage changes due to the stigma of adderall. I am terrified of being labeled a drug-seeker or losing access to what medication I have now. I genuinely want to graduate with a bachelor's in mechanical engineering as my brain is very happy with troubleshooting and solving problems. If self-discipline was the issue, I would not be suffering in college because it is absolutely draining my mental health.

&#x200B;

I feel like a failure because I know I am smart enough but I am incapable of using it to get the degree. Any advice is appreciated.

&#x200B;

Edit to add: I have been failing courses in college regularly and it is awful. This semester I failed since I could not finish the final report in the deadline. I had to drop another class because I was months behind. It has been really rough on my mental health.

&#x200B;

Edit again: Wow, as if I had to prove I had adhd by forgetting to address my main point and questions in the original post. Is 20mg adderall a high dose? Should I go higher if it helps most things in my life but still not enough for school? 60mg strattera is where I maxed out at since 80mg made me feel irritable and lethargic, so I am more focused on adjusting adderall.",1,"irritable, lethargic"
