# Adverse-Effect-Analysis-for-Psychiatric-Medication-through-In-Context-Pruning
Adverse drug events (ADEs) are a leading cause of hospital admissions, linked to increased morbidity and mortality, prior knowledge of these reactions can help prevent hospitalizations and premature deaths. Identifying ADEs in the post-marketing phase is essential for drug safety surveillance. Traditionally, data for this surveillance has come from spontaneous reporting systems, such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS),but most of the patients typically share their experiences on online forums and social media platforms like Reddit, which holds abundant patient and medication-related information that could accelerate drug safety research. ADE information in social media is often embedded in text, making it challenging to analyze with standard statistical methods.

This paper introduces a novel methodology, "In-Context Pruning" (ICP), leveraging a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model to perform off-topic filtering and context-sensitive ADE analysis on social media content. Our approach integrates ADE classification and extraction through a pipeline that includes SciBERT for entity extraction and synonym normalization to enhance data consistency. Additionally, we conduct ADE co-occurrence and drug class-level analyses to uncover associations between drugs and adverse effects. The resulting system identifies discrepancies between user-reported effects and official sources, offering valuable insights for improved pharmacovigilance.
