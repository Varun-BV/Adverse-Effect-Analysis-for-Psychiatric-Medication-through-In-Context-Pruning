        "title": "Reddit, I am short, balding, unhealthy, lazy, overweight, unattractive, and unhappy with what I'm doing with my life, I feel like I've hit a mid-life crisis, but I'm only 22 years old...What do I do?",
        "text": "I always tell myself I need to do this, and I need to do that, but how do I go beyond telling myself? I can never actually bring myself to do it. Every once in a while I am able to get myself to a gym and I find myself actually having a good time cycling or using the elliptical for an hour listening to my music and I enjoy myself, but despite that it's still a struggle to even get that far. I feel unhappy with my life and the minimal things I have accomplished. I feel extremely unattractive, and it doesn't help that thanks to my family's genes, all my fat accumulates in my belly, so I almost look as if I'm pregnant.\n\n\nThe only good thing I've felt that has happened to me in the last couple years is getting married. I love her very much and I couldn't ever possibly see myself with any other woman. Somehow she saw through any physical or mental facade I had and saw the real me. But my problem is I don't even know who I really am anymore. It is hard for me to get out of bed every morning, and if I didn't have any other obligations, I would lie in bed all day. I set multiple alarms for myself and I cancel each and every one when they go off in the morning. Even if the alarm is on the other end of the apartment. I will get up, turn it off, and go back to bed.\n\n\nI eat unhealthy food and can't make myself eat things that are good for me. I feel like I'm in a cycle of self destruction and I can't get out. It's killing me from the inside but I only keep making it worse day by day. I need help, what do I do?\n\n\n**edit** Thanks a ton for all the replies guys. I promise that I've read every single comment that was a reply to the post (I don't know if I'll be able to get through all the subcomments). I am indeed a very disorganized person, and people have given me links to places that can help me keep track and help me set goals for myself. The first step I am taking will be to wake up at specific times every day (save for the one or two days a week where I work until 3am). My plan will be to wake up, eat a healthy breakfast, and go to the gym. I think I'll also pay for a personal trainer so I can get some sort of workout plan since I really don't know much about the gym and when I go I just mindlessly do stuff with no direction (this will help in the goals department)",

I want to know how i can beat schizophrenia and ocd. What distractions do you advise of, and what worked for you? What kind of work suited your mind?\r\nI play team sports regularly, and only wish that I could do it all the time.\r\n I don't have any real spending money. \r\n\r\nWhat medications worked for you? I like olanzapine as it helps slow my thoughts down but it makes me sleep crazylong hours, and makes me pile on the weight, even though I am sporty. I am eager to hear in-depth experiences with Abilify and Clozapine.\r\n\r\nMy symptoms: I'm always trying to have good thoughts and wishes, I'm OBSESSIVELY concerned about morality and praying all the time, even though i'm not very religious. \r\n\r\nUPDATE: just like to say im doing much better now",

It's only recommended when most less invasive medication regimes have been unsuccessful.\n\nMy advice is to consult your doctor to discuss alternatives.\n\nI strongly suggest that you continue to take it in the mean time. \n\nSource: I'm a registered nurse in mental health",

And no medication or therapy did alleviate these problems, but recently I discovered that low dose clozapine at daytime (50-75mg) strongly alleviates these problems. Strangely, despite clozapine being usually said to be potent anticholinergic it turns out that it's very selective in action on different receptor isoforms, and respecting this it's more of a selective cholinergic/opioidergic/glutamatergic modulator. Also, its primary metabolite is N-desmethylclozapine which is present at higher tissue concentrations than the parent drug. And NDMC is a potent Delta opioid and M1 cholinergic agonist. The only major drawback is the possibility of agranulocytosis but fortunately, I'm also taking lithium which majorly prevents it.\n\nIs there anyone who had similar experiences with clozapine?",

        "text": "Hey Reddit,\n\nSo some years ago I (25M) had a bad experience with edibles, I had never been too enthusiastic about drugs but me and my best friends decided to try marihuana cookies one night and I had what is called a **bad trip**. The worst part was not being able to calm myself and observing how I couldn't stop laughing or have much control over my own body and how my mind was just spacing out somewhere else where I saw reality as a Vectrex game. This led to a couple of weeks of me obsessingly thinking about reality, human conscience, how we percieve existence and time... **In my mind I deconstructed everything and so everything became joyless**. I didn't consider suicide, but I wouldn't have minded too much being run over by a truck or something, I was THAT apathetic and disconected. Probably didn't help the stress of college and the fact that my girlfriend at the time left me when I was going through all that.\n\nSo.......... one day I asked for help and I got into the hospital. Long story short**: I didn't get any kind of psychological help**, on the contrary, I was put in psychiatry, the facilities were just a small floor inside the hospital so it got pretty claustrophobic after a couple of weeks, the doctors weren't supportive, they didn't really care about my situation, and when I finally broke down crying after two weeks of not doing anything in a small space where I wasn't comfortable with a medical staff that couldn't care less about my situation, **they upgraded my medication to clozapine**. I wasn't really given much information about the treatment, but I trusted they were profesionals and they knew what they were doing.\n\n**Clozapine is an antipsychotic used to fight schizophrenia**.\n\nAside from my pathetic emotional state from all the mental deconstruction I did and the Vectrex thing I saw after taking those edibles, I wasn't seeing things, or hearing things, or anything. I was pretty stable. Depressed af, because I was locked away in a place I absolutely hated, but yea, not much of a typical schizophrenia case.\n\nThe fun part was not finding out about the use of clozapine until many months later at home because I bothered to search for myself. And they surely didn't tell me about the fact that I \u00bfcould? have schizophrenia. In fact, **to this day I never got any kind of diagnosis**.\n\nAnd they didn't tell me, neither the staff at the hospital or the woman who would be my psychiatrist, that clozapine is a medicament so hard, even if there are signs that you might not have schizophrenia, that it's a standarized **5 year treatment and you can't stop taking the pills as its side effects could be devastating**.\n\nI had to leave college, twice, wasted a lot of my parents money because I couldn't study properly because the medication is so hard, but I insisted because I thought it was me who wasn't putting enough effort. All my friends suffered, because my mood, personality or... hell, even the ability to BE present were damaged. I constantly spaced out, I was very depressed, my parents even though they tried couldn't understand the struggle I went through and often they made me feel miserable. **Everything was a silent hell**. My life didn't progress for 4 years, in fact, I think it went backwards.\n\nIt didn't help that as I contacted people that knew about my problems and took a look at my case, they thought that the treatment I was given wasn't exactly the best but... \u00bfwhat I was supposed to do? I had to endure the treatment during 5 years anyway, because if I stopped taking the medication and I had a psychotic episode because *clozapine is a bitch*, then I would have been double screwed. And every professional, agreeded or not with my treatment, would have told me the same. Talking to my psychiatrist (the second one, because the first one was the coldest person that me or my parents ever met, so we asked for another one) to try to reduce the medication to help myself being a functional human being was pretty frustrating because... yea, the treatment is what it is, and even though he was a really nice person he wasn't really receptive towards the idea of clozapine reduction. For years I expressed my wish to do so, but I was always met with \"we'll talk about it next session\".\n\nI ended up cheating, I progressively reduced my medication in secret to the point where I ended the treatment one year earlier, and even though it was wrong I don't recommend doing that to ANYONE because it could be extremely dangerous, the thing worked out for me and even my psychiatrist cooperated with my decision and made sure I was ok. It's been over a year since I last took any kind of clozapine, I go to the psychiatrist every 3 months or so to check that everything is going ok and my quality of life has extremely improved. I'm a normal person again and even though wasting 4 years of my life being drugged was life defining for worse and beyond, things are looking better.\n\nSo here are some of the demons I have to face:\n\n\\-**I probably was victim of medical negligence**, and one part of me wants to scream till the end of time due to the frustration and even sue the hospital, but I know that that won't help anyone and I would eventually get tired and even more frustrated. I study Law and I know these kinds of case are pretty frustating and all around fruitless. But still, one part of me will have to endure the frustration I feel for god knows how many time and I can't even fight against it. I was powerless when being treated, and now that I'm a normal person again it's not even worth it.\n\n\\-**I was guilty of recklessness** by taking control of my medication. And the worst part is that it worked out for me. I can't really talk about my case without bringing that up, since it was probably the best thing I did during all the treatment, but at the same time it could have been a disaster.\n\n\\-**I can't talk about my case at all**. It's a tale of pure frustration and pain, no one wins when I bring it up. I get sad, angry and frustrated, and the few times I talked about it with my closest friends... they either feel awful or what's worse, they remind me that everything could have gone extremely wrong because I cheated, and they are right, but at the same time I feel ten times more frustrated because they will never know how I felt. In fact... are there people out there that know how I felt? I don't know and I'm not sure if I'll ever know because...\n\n\\-**Talking about it publicly? HELL. NO.** I became very aware that with the new rise of new age medical scepticism in today's day and age with all the anti vaxxers, my story could be weaponized to feed toxic and dangerious ideologies. So, even if I wanted to write about it and publish a story to... idk, vent my frustrations, I would probably do more harm than good. That's why I'm talking about it in a throwaway anonymous Reddit account.\n\n\\-**I'm late to life**. All my friends have ended college, the world has changed a lot these years and I still feel like I stopped at 20 years old and I haven't grown up. My young adulthood has been thrown in the garbage, and without a job and still figuring things out on how do I continue with life, I can't help but feel like I was left behind in a lot of ways and now I'm paying the price just when I'm most aware that life is so fragile and short. 4 years in the garbage like it was nothing.\n\n\\-**How do I get rid of this pain?** How do I heal these scars? How do I get rid of this frustration that invades my head everytime I think about this? My friends are great support, and I love them, but everything is over now. There's no sense to bringing their mood down just so I can vent till the end of time. There's no sense to that. I don't know what to do. I've mostly moved on, but thinking about it is still so much pain.\n\nIf you've read through all this, thank you.",

I concluded that this psychosis was likely a tulpa manifesting in my head.\n\nMy therapist and every single mental health professional said that I was mistaken, and I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2020. They understood that I enjoyed having them around, but they wanted to limit my interaction with them so I wouldn't be consumed in my own head. Four years, multiple psychiatrists, and about nine medications later, nothing made a dent.\n\nIn July, after going off of clozapine, my next psychiatrist (who I had worked with before going on clozapine) told me that if clozapine didn't work on my symptoms, the remaining medications we hadn't tried likely wouldn't either. We briefly discussed an alternative treatment that my last psychiatrist recommended: electroconvulsive therapy.\n\nI was hit with the very real risk of losing these friends in my head if took this course of action. I've been going back and forth between either option - speaking with family, mental health professionals, my head friends themselves, and myself for answers. If I keep them, I maintain a level of connection that might be unmatched by any physical person. I will continue to enjoy moments of companionship everywhere I go. If I lose them, I feel I might be able to truly live my life. I might be alone in my head, but maybe that's exactly what I need.\n\nThere is no right answer, only the lesser of two evils.

He works at our local government office here in the Philippines, and ever since then he's been nothing but happier than I saw him \u2014 I think.\n\nThat is when before he tried to get the board exam here in the Phillipines for Architecture.\n\nThe Architecture Licensure Exam is one of the most difficult exams there ever was, at least as far as I'm concerned. My dad is my number 1 role model in my life, and ever since he took the boards he has been nothing but acting silly.\n\nThe exam has two parts: the first part was all about multiple choice and about the architectural fundamentals, theories, and principles. At least that's what he told me that it was about that. The second part is much more tedious since it deals with calculations.\n\nOn the first day of his exam, he was, at one point what we call \"normal\". This isn't the first time that he acted this way. This is his fourth time in taking the boards, and every time he took it, it's like he becomes a different person entirely. My sisters and I are always scared that our dad cannot change to who he was, but since he's been on maintenance, we figured it was easier for him to sleep.\n\nHe takes Clozapine, and according to his doctor, it should help him sleep. And it did.\n\nIs there any way my dad can accept that, the changes in the exam should be applied, and his reviews can be rendered as useless since time has passed and the content of the exam has changed?

But once my psychosis was under control and I was put on clozapine, I started to notice I have no mood swings anymore. In fact, I barely cry, feel sad, feel angry anymore. I know to some people this might sound like a blessing but it\u2019s fucking me up. I want to feel like a human being again. I\u2019ve even considered stopping the medication myself so I can feel again. I feel like a fraud when I speak to other friends about BPD because I haven\u2019t had any feelings for so long now. Especially with my new friends as theyve only ever seen me this docile. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t want to have extremely BPD mood swings, I just want to be me again. So if anyone knows how I can get over this side effect or lessen it please let me know!\ud83d\ude4f I also doubled in weight since taking clozapine. I was around 8 stone when I first started taking it, now I\u2019m 19 stone! I don\u2019t feel like myself at all I\u2019ve never ever been this big in my life. I have no motivation to excersize or eat healthily (although I don\u2019t have binges anymore thank fuck!) and I\u2019m slowly getting bigger and bigger. I\u2019ve considered maybe taking weight loss injections but they are extremely expensive! I used to be addicted to cannabis and cocaine, and now I\u2019m sober (around the same time I started the clozapine) I feel like my addiction may have just replaced that with food. I really can\u2019t get any bigger it\u2019s making me so depressed and I don\u2019t want to meet anyone anymore even if they did find me attractive because I\u2019m that disgusted by how I look now.

        "text": "Hi, much to be honest i was on several antipsychotics and then i stopped taking them because of the rare side effects. I didn't have any psychosis symptoms, only mild depression, but my PDoc insisted to prescribe me those meds anyway. I said that this was rare side effects is because it's still prolonging and in my case this is not very common because i've talked to people who took the meds at several states & my PDoc have never found something like this, yea yea  i know that you guys probably will say that this was common, but still i feel so alone because almost no one have these symptoms (well almost no one has prolonging symptoms) it's like only 1%  chances of having this rarity while taking the meds. \n\nFor my near-detailed history. \n\nSo in July 2021 i took 3 different kind of meds (anti-psychotics) that included 1 anti-convulsant. I took Clozapine, Abilify, and for the Anti-convulsant i took Depakote/Valporic Acid. I was on them for 3-4 weeks  and in that period of times i had several motor issues including akathisia/restlessness but no tremors, GI issue (severe constipation) & drowsiness & losing appetite, also vomiting. I didn't know what the main precise dose is. \n\nAfter 3-4 weeks i stopped them because i can't take it anymore, nobody's listening to me nor even my PDoc, she thinks that it was the common side effects and that i had to try to take them all until next month and then she planned to tapper them off, but i can't stand the all bad side effects so i gave up and stop taking them. \n\nAfter entering the 9th months of stopping them i visited my psychiatrist and she gave me Artane to teat my tremors, but then again it only exacerbated the symptoms it was only just 1 tablet and the dose was 5mg, my PDoc also put me on Olanzapine/Zyprexa, honestly it helped me to sleep & actually it doesn't develop tremors, because the tremors happen even before i stopped taking 3 of my prior meds. But the artand did the culprit, serious. Just 1 pill snd my tremors went from legs to my hands, i was confused because Artane is a commonly prescribed medication to treat EPS symptoms. \n\n\nIt's now more than a year since off of them and i still have tremors, well.... I developed tremors in the process of stopping the first 3 meds, i have severe tremors on my both legs & hand fingers mostly it's really bad on my left side of my limbs, so they're asymmetrical tremors and postural (only happens in certain position and in this case it happens when i bend my fingers) i also noticed that my metabolism gets faster than before, every time i eat i'll dash into the loo, so i have problem with my bowel movement they're too fast, severe body temperature on every day or early in the morning, can't stand cold, severe drowsiness every time i wakes up in the morning. Keep in mind, the tremors occurred in the 4-5th month after stopped taking the first 3 medications. \n\nDoes anybody here know at least 1 or 2 of my current conditions? Are these reversible?  How do you find something helpful & i ask for your opinion about what should i do next since i'm lack of any information, yes yes i'll filters any stranger on the internet opinion of course. I just wanted to know the answer.",

        "text": " 7 Popular Medication Classes For Anxiety, Explained By an RN\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Selective_Serotonin_Reuptake_Inhibitors_SSRIs)\n* [Azapirones](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Azapirones)\n* [Antihistamines](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Antihistamines)\n* [Benzodiazepines](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Benzodiazepines)\n* [Beta Blockers](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Beta_Blockers)\n* [Tricyclic Antidepressant\u00a0 | TCAs](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Tricyclic_Antidepressant_TCAs)\n* [Antipsychotics](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Antipsychotics)\n* [Medication Log PDF](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Free_Medication_Log_PDF)\n\n## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs\n\n**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**\n\nDrug class\n\nThis is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain.\n\n**Over 10% of the US** takes an SSRI\n\nWhat Do SSRIs Do?\n\nWhat does **every** medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, you\u2019re blocking the neurons from *reabsorbing* Serotonin, meaning there is **more Serotonin** available.\n\nSince this medication increases serotonin levels, you\u2019ll have more of it to regulate your mood and symptoms of anxiety. Your brain also has to adapt to more Serotonin. It\u2019s thought that by your brain having to restructure from an increase in serotonin, it becomes more able to \u201cremodel\u201d and better able to adapt to stressors like anxiety.\n\nSo what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, and our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nSerotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. We can measure the levels in our blood, but we can\u2019t measure the levels within our brain. Meaning we\u2019re all in the dark as to how much we have in our brain.\n\n## Azapirones\n\n**Buspar Buspirone**\u00a0\n\nDrug Class\n\nBuspirone is in the drug class of Azapirones. There is no addiction risk, overall there are less side effects than many other anxiolytic medicines. It can take up to a month for the medication to work fully. Typically prescribed for *generalized* anxiety.\n\nWhat Does It Do?\n\nThis drug class impacts serotonin and dopamine receptors. The full mechanism of the drug aren\u2019t known actually. But, because it seems to take 2-4 weeks to make a difference, that would mean it likely has to do with the receptors for serotonin and dopamine.\n\nIt is thought that by the receptors adjusting, it can make them more adaptive and therefore *better able* to handle stress. Another possibility is that by blocking serotonin receptors, an increase of serotonin is available, which improves symptoms for some types of anxiety disorders.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe drug Buspar was originally developed for schizophrenia, but wasn\u2019t useful. It did however seem to help people with anxiety. Dizziness seems to be one of the most common complaints as far as side effects.\n\n## Antihistamines\n\n**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom,\u00a0 hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan,\u00a0 triprolidine, triafed**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different \u2018generations\u2019 & target different histamine receptors in our body.\n\n* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body\n* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion\n* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System\n* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched\n\nWhat Do Antihistamines Do?\n\nWe\u2019re actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that\u00a0**anti-**histamines are usually anticholinergic;\u00a0**blocking** receptors for choline.\n\n**Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax** are commonly prescribed for anxiety.\n\nWhile your risks with this drug class are much less severe than when taking benzodiazepines, these are first generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this also means they can impair our ability to remember, think and learn. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain.\n\nAn example of **second** generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won\u2019t do you much good.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways **in addition** to the reason why it\u2019s administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much **less** specific in their effects, they have more side effects.\n\nThough, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings (for anxiety included).\n\n## Benzodiazepines\n\n**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThese are commonly used as anxiety medicines (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.\n\nThis drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which **slows down** our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).\n\nAnesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?\n\nThe Drawbacks of Benzos\n\nWhen Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is we\u2019re now in a benzo addiction crisis. We\u2019re learning over time as a society, and those changes don\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nThis drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is **advantageously quick acting**, the effects linger.\u00a0 Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory.\n\nThe effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.\n\nThis is why a rehab center isn\u2019t going to allow the use of this drug class while recovering. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking benzodiazepines while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning at full capacity & you\u2019re not able to retain information, progress becomes much more difficult.\n\nThe most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.\n\nObviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They\u2019re a life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with consistent\u00a0*repeated*\u00a0use we will need\u00a0**increasingly** higher doses.\n\nAnother point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.\n\nThis is often what is referred to as\u00a0*\u201c****rebound anxiety****\u201d*\u00a0 because your anxiety is likely to get worse, **before** it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken frequently and long term.\n\nThe mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time. I\u2019ve even worked with prescribers who won\u2019t prescribe them, period.\n\nNow, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please don\u2019t go flush yours down the toilet after reading this!\n\n## Beta Blockers\n\n**acebutolol, atenolol, tenormin, bisoprolol, zebeta, metoprolol, lopressor, toprol XL, nadolol, corgard, nebivolol, bystolic, propranolol, inderal, innopran XL**\n\nDrug Class\n\nA beta blocker is most often used for heart conditions since this drug class lowers blood pressure and heart rate. But, they do this by blocking epinephrine which we commonly refer to as adrenaline. By blocking adrenaline, you prevent the progression of the physical symptoms of anxiety, like increased heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nThese can be prescribed \u201cas needed\u201d and is also prescribed long term to be taken regularly.\u00a0 Sometimes doctors will prescribe them for public speaking, or other stressful events someone has to face.\n\nWhat do Beta Blockers Do?\n\nWell, they Block Beta-adrenergic receptors, preventing norepinephrine and epinephrine from activating those receptors. This relaxes heart muscles, slows the heart beat, and lowers blood pressure.\n\nThat might seem completely unrelated to anxiety to some people, but when anxiety starts it will create **physical symptoms** that tend to make us feel even more panicked. This is why it can be pretty helpful to stop the physical symptoms from escalating an already *not-so-good* state of mind.\n\nDid you know?\n\nBeta blockers can be used for tremors, migraines, abnormal heart rhythms, and chest pain too.\n\nSummary\n\nBeta blockers can be a useful anxiety medication. As a nurse some of the things I pay attention to when a patient is prescribed them are obviously heart rate and blood pressure. **Energy level** is always something that can be impacted too.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for someone to become tired, groggy, lightheaded, or get headaches from beta blockers. Even for people who take it for high blood pressure and heart rate, it can have a tendency to drop them too low.\n\nEveryone is different, our diets change, our weight changes, our stress levels change, how hydrated we are fluctuates, our salt intake varies; and **all of these** impact our blood pressure. So, it\u2019s always a good idea to be keeping an eye on your heart performance with a beta blocker and your doctor who is prescribing should be too.\n\n## Tricyclic Antidepressant\u00a0 | TCAs\n\n**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThe word \u201ctricyclic\u201d refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed **before** SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays.\n\nTCAs are still often prescribed for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.\n\nWhat do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?\n\nWhat do **all** TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors.\n\nThese key differences from SSRIs create a cascade of effects in the body that make them a bit more likely to cause side effects; like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nIn 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 (a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new \u2018invention\u2019 was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.\n\nSummary\n\nThese drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life, while for another it can leave a bad impression.\n\n\\*Note each drug **within** the class impacts the *degree* of these effects a little differently.\n\n## Antipsychotics\n\n**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics**\n\n**risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette\u2019s syndrome, Huntington\u2019s disease, and anxiety.\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nMost drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.\n\nSchizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it\u2019s to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.\n\nThis class is broken up into two categories;\n\n**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which can impact our cognition and the complex way in which we store memories.\n\n\\*More movement disorders come with the first generation antipsychotics.\n\n**Second Generation: (new, atypical):**\u00a0Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors**.**\u00a0Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.\n\nHopefully this helps clarify some information on these common 7 classes of medications.

        "title": "Memory Loss and Mental Health Medications",
        "text": "Memory loss is a common topic within the mental health world. I'm an RN that works in Mental Health & going to do my best to summarize some research on *which* mental health medications impact our memory and *why* they do.\n\n**Memory** refers to the mechanisms that are used to collect, accumulate, preserve, and later retrieve information. There are three actions involved in **'memory'**: processing, storing, and recalling.\n\n## I will Include the link to the original post that is probably easier to follow but also going to include all the info below.\n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs\n\n**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**\n\n### Drug class\n\nThis is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain.

While we can measure the levels in our blood we cannot measure the levels within our brain. Meaning we\u2019re all in the dark as to how much is within our brain and whether or not it\u2019s even correlated to the amount in our blood.\n\nHow SSRIs Impact Memory\n\nAge and gender do not seem to influence the data that SSRIs are correlated with memory effects. Something that is important to mention, is that while research has shown that SSRIs are *correlated* with memory loss, that doesn\u2019t exactly mean that they CAUSE it. Correlation and cause are two different things. Many people that take SSRIs also take benzodiazepines, drink, smoke, have genetic predisposition to memory loss, etc. Depression and anxiety themselves can even cause memory problems.\n\nSummary\n\nSo, after reading through many articles, there overall wasn\u2019t enough credible information to emphatically say that an SSRI causes memory loss. In fact, I came across more research that suggested SSRIs improve cognitive performance and memory. Some data also specifically supported that SSRI\u2019s can improve memory for patients experiencing psychosis and depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Tricyclic Antidepressant\u00a0 | TCAs\n\n**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThe word \u201ctricyclic\u201d refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed before SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays. TCAs are still often administered for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.\n\nWhat do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?\n\nWhat do all TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors. These key differences create a cascade of effects in the body that do impact memory. These key differences are also the culprit for the common side effects in this drug class like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nIn 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 ( a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new 'invention' was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.\n\nHow TCAs Impact Memory\n\nThere are multiple reasons why a TCA impacts our memory. **The first reason** is that we retain memory best when norepinephrine is released at an optimal rate. These drugs block the reabsorption of norepinephrine; which is known to be a moderator of memory. With too much of it, we are anxious and stressed, too little of it and we are drowsy and not as coherent. Either way, the drug has an impact on norepinephrine which directly influences how we store memory.\n\n**The second reason** why this drug class impacts memory is because it competes with our natural antagonists on muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is well documented that these drugs block muscarinic receptors (which is an acetylcholine receptor), and acetylcholine directly impacts learning and memory.\n\n>*\u201cMuscarinic*\u00a0acetylcholine\u00a0*receptors* in the hippocampus and cortex underlie\u00a0*memory*\u00a0formation\u201d\n\nSummary\n\nSo, TCAs are a drug that research has linked with memory impairments and dementia. These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life (even could improve memory if their extreme anxiety was impairing it), while for another it can make them drowsy and leave a bad impression.\n\n\\*Note each drug within the class impacts the degree of these effects a little differently.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling like doing a deep dive into some of the articles I read to gain clarity, by all means, click the links below!\n\n[Differential Cognitive Actions of Norepinephrine \u03b12 and \u03b11 Receptor Signaling in the Prefrontal Cortex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4876052/)\n\n[The effect of tricyclic antidepressants on cholinergic responses of single cortical neurones.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1666268/?page=7)\n\n[A brief history of antidepressant drug development: from tricyclics to beyond ketamine](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-neuropsychiatrica/article/brief-history-of-antidepressant-drug-development-from-tricyclics-to-beyond-ketamine/B5C9D55C6299BC41B237187DB609DB68)\n\n## \n\n## Benzodiazepines\n\n**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThese are commonly considered anti-anxiety medication (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s taco \u2018bout it.\n\nThis drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which slows down our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).\n\nDid You Know?\n\nAnesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?\n\nHow Benzodiazepines Impact Memory\n\nThis drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is advantageously quick acting, the effects linger.\u00a0 Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.\n\nThis is why a rehab center isn\u2019t going to allow the use of 'said drug' while \u2018recovering\u2019. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking 'said drug' while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning & you're not able to remember anything, how can you work on it? The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.\n\nNow, don't shoot the messenger. Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They're an actual life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with *repeated* use we will need *increasingly* higher doses, making the dent in your memory more and more indisputable.\n\nFull Disclosure\n\nMy mother was an addict, benzodiazepines being her drug of choice.\n\nDo you know an addict whose drug of choice is a benzodiazepine? No SHAME, but if so, you can probably attest that **they don\u2019t remember shit.**\u00a0\n\nHow about an addict whose drug of choice is alcohol? All love here, but you can say for certain, *they don\u2019t remember shit*.\n\nThere has even been a fair amount of data to support that the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s is elevated in those taking the drug for over 6 months. One Harvard study even speculated that it would raise the risk by 84%! Seems unrealistic, but who am I to question Harvard; I'll add the link below if you're also feeling speculative.\n\nAnother point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.\n\nThis is often what is referred to as *\u201crebound anxiety\u201d*\u00a0 because your anxiety is likely to get worse, before it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken long term.\n\nTake it from a nurse who works in mental health; it's not enjoyable being the bystander of a patient trying to escape their benzo addiction.\n\nBut this is why the mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time.\n\nNow, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please don\u2019t go flush yours down the toilet after reading this.\n\nWhen Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is that we\u2019re now in a benzo addiction crisis. We\u2019re learning over time, as a society and those changes don\u2019t happen overnight. And trust me, as a mental health professional I myself occasionally grow infuriated at the amount of family doctors who prescribe copious amounts of benzodiazepines only to later turn the patient away after addiction has crippled them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Harvard Article Claims Benzodiazepine use may raise risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/benzodiazepine-use-may-raise-risk-alzheimers-disease-201409107397#:~:text=People%20who%20had%20taken%20a%20benzodiazepine%20for%20three,84%25.%20The%20type%20of%20drug%20taken%20also%20mattered.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cRight now I\u2019m having amnesia and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at the same time. I think I\u2019ve forgotten this before.\u201d  \n\u2015\u00a0Steven Wright\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Anti-Epileptics\n\ntopiramate, topamax, zonisamide, zonegran, levetiracetam, keppra, pregabalin, lyrica, clonazepam, klonopin, rufinamide, banzel, vigabatrin,\u00a0 sabril, phenytoin, dilantin, oxcarbazepine, trileptal, carbamazepine, tegretol, lamotrigine, lamictal, lacosamide, vimpat, valproic acid, depakote, phenobarbital, gabapentin, neurontin\n\nDrug Class\n\nAnti-seizure medications are commonly used for mood disorders and even anxiety in addition to epilepsy.\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nEpilepsy is caused by **excessive** hyperexcitability of the nervous system therefore, medications in this class are geared toward minimizing excitability. This drug class actually encompasses three different major classes\n\n1. Blocking Sodium Channels\n2. Enhancement of GABA Inhibition\n3. Regulation of Synaptic Releases\n\nWhy it Impacts Memory\n\nOverall, anticonvulsants work in different ways; trust me I rode the magic school for HOURS trying to gain an understanding of them to write this. Truthfully, we still have a lot to learn about them. Their impact is complicated and the effects range based on the dose and drug.\n\nFor instance, Topamax has pretty diverse pharmacologic actions, because of that, it **has** been linked with impaired concentration, cognitive dulling, psychomotor retardation, language and comprehension difficulties, rather extreme effects on short-term memory and working memory, poor verbal fluency and word-finding, reduced IQ scores, abnormal thinking and delayed cognitive speed. Because of this dark cloud of side effects, Topamax is sometimes referred to as 'Dope-A-Max'.\n\nHowever, a more selective medication within the drug class such as Phenytoin or Tegretol are more specific to blocking sodium channels. Overall, they seem to have less impact on memory and cognitive function.\n\nMany of these drugs listed above have an impact on GABA, and long term exposure to GABA agents can alter the functionality of GABA permanently, which means there are potentially permanent consequences to cognition, behaviors, and memory.\n\nPhenobarbital has been linked to lower IQ, and worse effects than Depakote and Tegretol, however it is actually a barbituate. It\u2019s effects are similar to benzodiazepines which you can read more about above.\n\nGabapentin, used for seizures and often mood disorders, belongs to it's own drug class. Still, it **has** been linked to memory impairment. Hence, the name, it also impacts GABA, which as mentioned several times now, certainly plays a hand in our ability to remember. At this point there isn\u2019t enough research to say it\u2019s linked to dementia though.\n\nAs far as drugs for epilepsy, Gabapentin is tolerated much better than many others. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that this drug seems to have more *short term* effects on memory. Some will experience a disorienting feeling or short term memory loss while taking Gabapentin, but the reports of long term memory being impacted are reported less often.\n\n[Long Term Effects of Gabapentin](https://deserthopetreatment.com/sedatives/gabapentin-addiction/long-term-side-effects/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Antipsychotics\n\n**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics; risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome & Huntington's disease\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nMost drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nOddly enough, memory seems to actually be improved when using an antipsychotic for a person with psychotic symptoms, though there are many that take medications within this class that are not psychotic. So let's talk about that more.\n\nWhy It Impacts Memory\n\nFirst, let's skip back to the purpose of these drugs. Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it's to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.\n\nThis class is broken up into two categories;\n\n**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which do impact the complex way in which we store memories. \\*More movement disorders come with the old ones.\n\n**Second Generation: (new, atypical):** Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors**.** Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.\n\nWhat do they all have in common? **They impact Dopamine.** Long story short; A delicate balance of Dopamine is needed for memory to function. Since this class targets Dopamine, it's fair to say it has the potential to alter our memory. Whether that's a good or bad thing is specific to the patient, but it's typically an unwelcome effect.\n\n# \n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Antihistamines\n\n**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom,\u00a0 hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan,\u00a0 triprolidine, triafed**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different 'generations' & target different histamine receptors in our body.\n\n* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body\n* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion\n* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System\n* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nWe're actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that **anti-**histamines are usually anticholinergic; **blocking** receptors for choline. The problem is that we need choline to be readily available to have the ability to learn, understand and remember.\n\n### Why it Impacts Memory?\n\nBeing that antihistamines are often anticholinergic, they do impair our ability to think, learn and remember. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain. We already naturally produce less acetylcholine overtime. This is partly why as we age our ability to remember, think, and learn diminishes. It's widely known that anticholinergics impact memory, thinking, learning, and muscle function. It is also suggested that these drugs increase the risk of developing dementia.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways in addition to the reason why it's administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much less specific in their effects, they are affiliated with greater memory impairment. Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings.\n\n### Summary\n\nOverall, the effects range. Regarding mental health specifically; Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax are commonly prescribed for anxiety. While your risks are much less severe than benzodiazepines, these are FIRST generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this is also means they do impair our ability to remember.\n\nAn example of second generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won't do you much good.\n\nHope this helps clarify some of the impacts of memory and mental health medications. Leave a comment if there is a drug you're still wondering about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the link again for original post below. \n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)",

A section is form of false imprisonment whether legal or not. Someone would be section just for a single report from a stranger or citizen from the community and it is not taken into consideration the value and the trustworthiness of the word of these reports. The reports are accepted where the validity of the words of the report are right or not are considered.\n\nA section 2 at the mental health act is for assessment and it is a 28 day section. I am protesting because sectioning someone at the mental health act takes them away from their place of residence for goverment and state facilities the food is poor the facilities are poor the beds are poor the staff disrespect food deliveries are difficult you are not allowed leave and all this just for a mental health psychiatric assessment.\n\nAnother reason for protest is that the psychiatric staff do not attempt to help you leave they try and keep me it is form of false imprisonment because it is imprisonment without trial and try and make you stay trying and make you stay shows that their assessment would not be open minded and generous for the psychiatric patients argument.\n\nLastly if it is an assessment it should be done in the community and it should not be done in government facilities which are poor and removing a patient and british citizen from their place of residence simply for psychiatric and mental health.\n\nI am protesting this system and I am protesting the laws in place that allow this system for be facilitated.",

        "text": "My (23F) twin brother (23M) has been diagnosed with psychosis since September 2020. He is currently in his second year at university and lives near his university when it is term time, however he has just left the psychiatric mental hospital for 4 months as they've told him to come back home for the Christmas holidays. They have prescribed him depakote and clozapine ever since his admission. He is still attending university during this time, but virtually as the UK has gone under lockdown again until mid-February. He said he has attempted suicide multiple times (overdosing on pills, drinking bleach, etc.) and then after he says he \"didn't mean to\" or \"it wasn't intentional\".\n\nWe have told him not to be involved with the wrong crowd, but he doesn't listen. The police confiscated his phone because he was money laundering for other people and he keeps going into debt when there is no reason why he should be - his loans were enough to cover his food and accommodation fees (here in the UK student loans don't have to be repaid unless they earn over \u00a327000 and will be cancelled after 30 years). He got stressed about his phone being taken away from him. And I think the final straw was the lockdown just not helping university students at all. Because his phone was taken away, he became very isolated and talking to himself a lot in a repetitive negative manner, When he finished his first year at university, my parents picked him up and his university room was in bad shape (no laundry has been done, room smelled terrible, etc.).\n\nHe always had issues with listening and taking orders from others, especially my dad. My Dad is quite frustrated having the same conversation with him again and again since he was 12. He would never tidy his room, and always squeezes instead of folding his homework and important papers. He didn't really do well in school, but he has made it to university and that's an achievement for him (I keep reminding him when his self-esteem is low).\n\nHe is really stubborn. We have told him that everytime he leaves the house, he should tell someone where he is going so that we do not worry about his whereabouts. There would be times where he'll come back at 3am in the morning, ringing the doorbell and calling me or the rest of family to open the door, not being considerate of how his actions are affecting others.\n\nI am trying to help him to go to sleep, because this is the only thing he needs to focus on right now (he hasn't slept in 7-9 days), and it's the same cycle again and again. He gets up, has a panic attack, hyperventilates, says repetitive negative things, etc. I've tried to help him go to sleep 45 times now.\n\nSymptoms he currently has:\n\n\\- Afraid he's going to jail or prison\n\n\\- anxious about debt\n\n\\- trouble sleeping (he thinks he's going to die in his sleep)\n\n\\- saying repetitive negative phrases about himself out loud\n\n\\- very depressed\n\n\\- shaking/trembling\n\n\\- suicidal (he says it's always accidental)\n\n\\- memory loss and forgetful (can't remember short term events)\n\n\\- very, very distracted and always walking around\n\n\\- very low self-esteem (about his looks, intellectual capability,...)\n\n\\- hyperventilates and panics a lot\n\n\\- stutters and can't form sentences\n\nI have to help him because if he's going through psychosis, it means that this is rock bottom and the only way from here is upwards. Can someone please help us or has anyone been through similar psychosis behaviour?",

Although I don't think quitting cigs had anything to do with my hospitalization (I had been struggling for a while and was becoming increasingly suicidal), I feel a lot better and I attribute that to cigarettes. Could it be that smoking helps mitigate my symptoms? I have depression, anxiety, OCD, and possibly ADHD. I am on Effexor, Buspar, Klonopin, Risperidone, and Clozapine. The incessant emotional pain is all but gone and I feel happier.

        "title": "Something about Alpha \u03b1-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists and its use in mental health and psychiatry",
        "text": "The **alpha (*****\u03b1*****) -1 adrenergic receptor antagonists** (also called alpha-blockers) are a family of agents that bind to and inhibit type 1 alpha-adrenergic receptors and thus inhibit smooth muscle contraction. Appart from their use in neuro-psychiatry, their major uses are for hypertension and for symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy. Their use in therapy of hypertension is based on the inhibition of vascular resistance in arterioles from alpha-adrenergic blockade, which results in an increase in venous capacitance and lowering of blood pressure.\n\nAlpha1-adrenergic receptors are engaged in a range of autonomic, neuroendocrine and behavioral functions. These comprise motor functions, attention and vigilance, fear and anxiety, reinforcement, sensory gating, learning, sexual behavior, and regulation of blood pressure and of both the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal and hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal systems (HPA and HPG Axis).Alpha1-adrenergic receptors also regulate mesocorticolimbic dopamine systems and multiple reactions to addictive drugs. They are located primarily in the pre-synaptic regions (unmyelinated axons and axon terminals) of the mesocorticolimbic system, thereby regulating neurotransmission in this area, as well as drug generated modifications in extracellular dopamine concentration and locomotor activation.\n\nHere I quote part of the article \"Alpha1-Adrenergic Receptor Antagonists Use in Treatment and Prevention of Psychiatric Disorders\", by Abhishek Wadhawan *et al*, 2015.\n\n\"**Potential Role of Alpha1-Adrenergic Antagonists in Treating Mood Disorders**\n\nPrazosin has been shown to improve anhedonia, which is a part of the depressive symptoms in hypertensive patients, but prazosin or other A1As have not been formally studied in other mood disorders. It is well known that depressive states are related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system activation. HPA activation is associated with psychomotor agitation and anxiety in both major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Increased arousal is an exceedingly prominent feature of activated depressions, whether they are characterized as mixed states *\\[with features of both melancolia and atypcal-anergic depression\\]* or as agitated depression. Similarly, sympatho-adreno-medullary function is also augmented in a manner that correlates with the severity of anxiety and agitation in MDD or BD depressed patients without manic symptoms, as well as in mixed mania \\[negative mania\\]. It is suggested that increased epinephrine and metanephrine secretion, which is an indication of adrenomedullary activation, are both coherent with increased \u201cdepressive\u201d agitation across MDD, BD depressive states, and in the mixed states\".\n\nBased on their biological mechanism of action, A1As may possibly help in agitated depression and mixed depressive states of BD, as well as BPD.\n\nThe potebntial for Alpha1-Adrenergic Antagonists is vast, from treating Borderline Personality Disorder, to Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and also in treating Psychotic Symptoms.\n\nIt has been shown that elevated level of NE impairs prefrontal cortical functioning via alpha1-adrenergic receptor stimulation.\n\nAnd has been clearly recognized that during stress exposure, higher levels of NE are secreted in the Prefronta\u00f1 Cortex, and it has been further demonstrated that higher NE concentration stimulates alpha1 receptors and weakens prefrontal cortical function. Hence, NE has an upturned U-shaped influence on PFC functioning, implying that both very small and very large amounts of the NE impair PFC functioning.\n\nGiven their unique properties, A1As seem to be promising in the treatment as well as in secondary prevention in psychiatry. Secondary prevention involves interrupting the disease mechanism and preventing future episodes for those who are at risk.\n\nA1As may be particularly useful in secondary prevention in chronic stress mediated conditions, such as children and adults with records of maltreatment in early-life. Alpha1-adrenergic antagonists, due to their strengthening effects on PFC functioning, down regulation of CRF mediated stress pathways and favorable metabolic profile can be potentially effective agents in a number of these chronic stress mediated psychopathological conditions.\n\n**Some Alpha1 adrenergic antagonists** are: **Prazosin** (which is the one with more documented use in psychiatry), Terazosin, Doxazosin, Silodosin, Alfuzosin and Tamsulosin. And **among the commonly used antidepressant-psychotomimetic therapeutic agents**, some with a **strong alpha 1 adrenergic antagonzing properties** are **Mianserin**, **Mirtazapine**, **Amitriptyline** and **Nortriptyline**; also **Clozapine** is one with such qualities. All these agents have much therapeutic value and have shown effectivenes in a variety of psycho-physiological disorders, when the proper profile of the patient is met.\n\nHowever caution is advised with these agents, as depending on their selectivity they can also bring forth some (sometimes) serious side-effects (it seems to be related with the genetic variability in population of CYP2D and CYP2C19 allheles, which can be tested out). For example, until some days ago I was taking amitriptyline 75 mg at night, to augment and boost my Parnate, of which I ran out of stock, and in the meantime of importing the medicine I had to reduce drastically my dose, which very rapidly made me relapse into depression and feel awful again... Amitriptyline worked to some extent, in fact depression after a week was much better, as well as anxiety, and gave me some more euthymia, but soon I began experimenting pain in my organs, even liver (appart from the awfully high heart rate and unstability in BP), but I said, ooh f\\*ck it, and kept taking it as to not feel depressed (I also like how it makes me sleep no matter what), until something really nasty started to happen, which I immediately associated with the inhibition part of smooth muscle contraction of Alpha-1 Adrenoreceptor antagonism; weird incapacity of achieving full orgasm (kind like it was cut in parts and weird, even a little painful), then strange contractions when peeing, which soon became like spasms in my bladder which felt really painful and horrible, appart from not being able to pee appropiately... that scared the shit out of me and finally stopped amitriptyline cold turkey (I may take no more than 25 mg meanwhile my Parnate arrives).\n\nI know Amitriptyline is a great antidepressant, and its own \"dirtyness\" makes its own very effectiveness, as with the antagonism of Alpha-1 adrenoreceptors (among many neurotransmitter inter-actions), and that many people don't experiment this, but for me was very clear, and being that my father have prostatic problems and so (all related to these receptors), I said no more for me, rather feel more depressed and rely on stimulants and kratom a little more in the meanwhile, but not to fuck with my urinary and prostatic muscular system, I don't need more problems.\n\nI include this experience of mine within all the written text, not to scare anyone or negativize things, but just as a reminder to be careful with every psychopharm or whatever substance we use, and be smart and wise.\n\nHope this contribution, as small as it may be, may be useful in any degree.

Well, I\u2019m now considered voluntary under the mental health act of Canada B.C and see a psychiatrist. She has, much to my appreciation reduced my nightly dose of Clozapine to a significant degree. Though I had asked before for dose to be lowered, and had to see a pharmacist for daily witness for some time, at one point my friends and family said this is enough and spoke to Dr. Grisham advocating for me to be off witness and back on self admin as well as dose lowered. Which worked out in my favour, I gotta say. Some nights gosh, I am so grateful I have this treatment scheme and rely on the meds heavily for sleep but, other times the clozapine just gets in the way and I want total autonomy. Can I ask to be taken off meds, as a voluntary and self aware/ willing participant in my treatment. Or else, how will I ever face a lifetime of continual treatment for something I do believe is non biological in nature ie. the schizophrenia and if I am in fact, dealing with a lifelong diagnosis of schizophrenia, and that in the long term will again, and though it seems arbitrary in the long view of things, can I and I\u2019m what way will I request alternative treatment measures that will not include a forced drugging regime and other factors that interfere some of the time, with my wishes and long term goals. All I want is to be healthy, listened to and to receive the correct treatment that I will benefit from most in my recovery. Like what, do I just ask for that, a revision of my care plan and how can I incite more care from my doc in terms u can agree with such as NLP/CBT/Psychoanalysis.",

        "title": "What is Adhd? Thank any of you that take the time to read this mess.",
        "text": "Let me started by saying I grew up with a mother who always told me adhd is not a real thing. I believe she'd give an excuse that kids are just hyper. \n\nGrowing up I had difficulty reading which lead to my poor grammar, spelling, and math problems with words. I had 3 brothers that often made fun of me for this. They are good people but just teased a lot. My parents would jump in with the teasing and I'd cry and my mom would say I'm too sensitive. I'm not sure if this is true or not but it hurt my confidence. Plus I already had poor confidence with how I look. As school went on I did okay unless there was a math problem on the board or I had to read aloud. Oh my gosh the anexity made me sick. I stare at the problem and just can't solve it. I hear anyone laugh and I want to cry, even if it wasn't at me. In school I got some A's but mostly B's and C's.\n\nI do love learning especially with science and history. I specifically loved a teacher what would test us in essay form. She didn't check grammar or spelling but you just wrote everything you could remember and get points from that. It was amazing and I did very well with this. I'm sure it was a mess just like this post though.\n\nI went to college and unfortunately only did 2.5 years. It is a blur. The first year I failed everything. I was put into a class that help keep you organized and focus which actually placed me on the Dean's list the following year. Then the next year I fell through again. I started dating at this time and from there on out I had fail relationship after relationship. I had a nasty temper and just never thought people were telling the truth. I was so insecure. I had went through at least 6 longer relationships and none worked. Once 23 hit I also started drinking. It helped with the anexity I got from social interaction. I to be social but I dredded it. Before and after I hung out with people. I would just think over random thoughts and be like, \"oh my god why did I say those things!?\" Or \"why do people even like me?\" My mind would always be racing on what people thought of me to random other things. It was like my mind never got rest. This lead to more failed relationships, drinking, and not being able to hold a stable job. I thought this was because of anexity or depression. \n\nMy dad died when I was 21 after being sick on and off for years plus all my grandparents. Which started random thoughts about death and the after part. This would create panic attacks later in life (currently) and this extreme fear of death. I was never suicidal but one time during a huge fight with an ex I had downed a bottle of ibuprofen. We were drinking a lot too. We drank almost every night. I was definitely an alcoholic. I really believe this made me calm or focused. It wasn't until recently that I met someone else who is a saint. He is the most calming person and it help me a little. I was still drinking and sadly I was hiding it in places so my boyfriend wouldn't know. I'd black out more than I'd like to say. I would have a stressful day at work and or my brother's brain tumor diagnosis that made me feel it was okay to have a little to calm down all my thoughts. My thoughts wouldn't just be on this things. I mean it could be any random thing in the world, like what was the Egyptian lifestyle like. Again, I love learning just at my own pace and on what I want. I get bored VERY fast though. So I would jump topics all the time. I'm pretty good a random trivia though! \n\nAnyways, I realized I was an alcoholic and I hated that I was doing this to my boyfriend. He would hide it from me and I'd feel sick about it. I could and cant lose him. I finally went to doctor A. She put me on effexor and we tried propranolol (did nothing), clozapine(hated it), and gabapentin (which help a ton but I can't really tell if it's still working.) The effexor alone did me absolute wonders. I stopped drinking. I stopped the day I started the meds. I haven't looked back and it's never on my mind except being proud of myself and this felt like an accomplishment that I couldn't really blurt out to anyone. I lost 15lbs. I 5'2 and I was pushing 130ish and above. I'm not really active though. The effexor side effects make me kind of eh and tired, but it isn't the worst. My emotions seem way better except I instead of constantly worrying I'm thinking about so many random things. I spend way to much time on my phone just researching random stuff. So my work life is still being interfered with these thoughts and unfortunately I haven't been able to get much more than an administrative assistant job. Ironically I had to take a personality test that my boss swears by and said that my score was great for this position because I enjoy doing all kinds of subjects and not more focused like our accounting departments. Though for my performance review I did get docked for looking or things and careless mistakes. I don't want to be in this position but I just never felt I could finish anything else.\n\nMy hobbies are all gone. I just can't focus on them. Video games that I loved just never happen. I just feel stuck. I feel happy though! I keep positive! Again, effexor helped a great deal I'm just scared it will stop. I'm also terrified about weening off. It sounds like torture.\n\nSo here I am, with a new doctor because doctor A was extremely disorganized (I am too.) and had no staff. She lost my records on top of other things. Plus I was really upset about being put on benzos which I told her I really did not want to start. \n\nThis new doctor seems very genuine and got me talking so much. However when I left I was like, \"holy cow my conversation was all over the place.\" I don't even know if he could understand everything. The things that scared me is that he suggest taking me off my 150mg of effexor. Which felt like a life saver. He knew before i said anything that my sex life was non existent and I do really feel bad about this. Not that it was great before it but it's nowhere now. I feel so bad for my boyfriend. He never complains though. I guess there are other side effects too but they seemed okay to put up with. I told him as of this time I cant think about stopping it. \n\nAs we kept talking he did mention I seemed to show some signs of adhd. I laughed because I have never heard this and again all my life I believed it was made up. I have looked up symptoms before and thought, \"nah that's not me and I'm not hyper.\" But as I searched more things seemed to fit with it. I'm not sure if anyone saw an article about rejection sensitive dysphoria\u00a0(RSD) and link to adhd, but rsd describes exactly what I feel a lot. So here I am. I'm very confused and not sure what i have. I'm worried about losing the effexor and what my new mental health plan would be. \n\nI know I need to bring this up to the doctor, but did anyone else have symptoms like this and is it at all related to adhd or is it just general anxiety? Am I just lazy and not motivated? Is it even worth considering? Do people get over diagnosed with adhd? My doctor mention a test I needed to take but our appt was around 2 hours and we both forgot. I'm not even sure if that was what the test was for. \n\nIn my mind I thought adhd was a super hyper person that just talks all the time. Sorry, I was ignorant to all of it. Thank you all for taking this time to read this. Sorry for the mess and word vomit. I really appreciate it.\n\nEdit: Oh not to sound gross but I have this real bad urge to pick scabs. I hate it. I have to put band aids on. Nothing at all has helped me with this. I have lots of scars. It's really sad. Anyone have this?",

        "title": "Hello",
        "text": "This will probably be a long post. \n\nJust to get you into the right context: I'm twenty-two at the moment and I live in Russia. Actually turning twenty-two in two weeks. I don't know what I'm suffering from, but I feel like I'm going to lose control sooner or later. \n\nI want to first tell you about my childhood because that's where it all started. I guess I was a happy boy until I turned eleven or twelve. My parents divorced when I was five, but it's a pretty normal thing for Russia. Half of my friends' parents were already divorced by the time, the other half divorced later. My parents continued living together for a while after they broke up. Sometimes dad had to leave the house because of another quarrel my mom gave him, but he would always come back in a week or two. I only remember seeing them fight once, though they were screaming at each other really often. After my dad lost his job and our family started to run out of money, my mom finally decided that he had to leave for good. So he did. She started searching for a man and working at two jobs in the meantime. After a while, she found some rich guy and they got married. After I turned ten or eleven I started hanging out with some spoiled kids, around the same time I discovered cigarettes and alcohol. I was drinking insanely huge amounts of alcohol and somehow I was able to hide it for quite a long time. I guess that's where my *problem* started to develop. I remember being a very emotional kid, like, *really emotional.* I would cry for no reason, laugh, too. I laughed a lot, some people even thought that I was fucked in the head and started avoiding me. So my circle of friends started to shrink and I was left with a few of the most freaky ones. \n\nAround the same time, my studying in school went downhill. You see, I've been a really smart kid back then in terms of studying, grades and stuff. I was only getting A+(s) and was always ahead of the class in every subject. I started reading when I was like three and my mother started showing me to her friends as if I was some fucking exhibit. She always told me that she and my dad always wanted to rise a genius and were preparing for my birth for two years, she always prised my mental abilities and told me that I have to become someone significant, that I'm *the chosen one* and other stuff like that. So, when I was twelve there was no genius left in me, I was drinking frequently, some cheap booze they sold in those small shops. One time I've bought myself a bottle of gin (not an actual gin, it was a slang word for the cheapest kind of alcohol available, it's like juice mixed with pure ethanol, it was around 8%) and drank it all alone in the forest behind the school. That was the first time I felt dissociation. Everything just zoomed out and the world started to look like a photograph, I felt like I'm not there at all, like I don't even exist. I rushed home, I was so freaked out that I sat in the corner and kept silence for three or four hours. Even when my mom tried to talk to me I didn't answer. After I recovered a little, I told my parents about what happened (my dad didn't live with us, obviously, but he lived in the same town). They didn't take me seriously, but after some time they brought me into some kind of a private clinic and I've got inspected by a shrink. This woman gave me a prescription for Phenibut and put down a nonexistent (literally, there's no such thing even in Russian classification) diagnosis. After like two months on the medication I got better and every symptom was gone. A year later my mother left the house to live with her new husband leaving me and my younger brother (I forgot to mention him, he's 16 now and lives a happy life) alone. She visited us daily, but I had to watch my brother all the time as he was just a little kid with absolutely no brains. I can't say I didn't enjoy living on my own by the time, because I could do everything I wanted with no restrictions.\n\nAround the time when I turned fourteen, I fell in love with a girl, this time for real. Shit was strong, I was obsessed with her. She seemed like a loner, just as I was, and this thing about her was the most appealing I guess. We started dating, but after a while I dropped her. That was funny because two weeks later I came back begging her to be with me again. Well, we got together again, though our relationship has started to decay from this point. After a year and a half, when I was sixteen, she would \"break up\" with me every two months, ignore my calls and messages, and all this stuff was just driving me crazy. I became really anxious and sometimes even paranoid. I was the opposite of \"confident\" around her. I was just shaking. \n\nWhen I turned seventeen, I had to prepare for my final exams in school which were taking place in the next year. I and that girl I mentioned were still \"dating\" and my anxiety was on the highest level possible. So one day I was in a car with my dad who volunteered to drive me to school this morning and everything just went blank. No feelings, no emotions, no people, no engine humming, no white snow on the trees, no forest. Well, everything was still there but it has transferred in a totally different state of existence. I just could not *feel* it. It was blank. Like chewing paper. No taste, no color, nothing. And this time it didn't go away in two months. It stayed. \n\nWhen I was a child, I was always shamed by my parents if I showed any signs of weakness, so I was silent about what happened for the first two or three weeks. But then this thing became unbearable and I told them everything. I knew exactly what was happening to me, because when I was fifteen or sixteen I started reading books dedicated to psychiatry, psychoanalysis and general psychology. I knew I was depersonalized and I even had my guesses where it was rooting from. First, I went to the doctor my uncle suggested to me. He was a therapist, and that was an analytical kind of therapy. It didn't help. I started getting severe panic attacks and developed persistent anxiety. It got to the point where I just went to the clinic and asked if they could take me for a treatment, but they said that all the places were taken. In Russia, nuthouses are like prisons and that's not an overstatement. They are literally like prisons and sometimes even worse, but this one was fine. But they couldn't take me. I've had another option but in this clinic they only had one decent(well, bearable) department out of sixteen and I was not ready to risk. I was told at the first clinic that I have to wait for one month and then they can take me in. One month was too long. Each day my anxiety grew and I could not stand it anymore. I just called the second clinic and they told me that I could come tomorrow. I got lucky and was assigned to the decent department. At this point my anxiety was so bad I couldn't really talk and just agreed on everything the shrink said. \n\nI amnesized first two weeks in a nuthouse and I still can't remember a single thing out of what was happening to me in this period. My mom, who visited me frequently, later told me that I was walking like a zombie wearing a diaper moaning instead of talking and sleeping for 24 hours straight. After they let me go I discovered that the first day I got there they injected me I/V with a massive dose of antipsychotics and benzos because they have though I was in a state of psychosis. After the two weeks, I regained my consciousness and was able to talk again (just a little bit tho). I asked what medication they put me on but they refused to answer telling me that was for my own safety. I knew that if I would start complaining they would just strap me to the bed with the belts and inject me with chlorpromazine just as they did to other patients so I've decided to stay quiet. Later I discovered that I was put on Risperidone which was later changed for Zyprexa. I stayed in this place for three months, and not because I wanted to, but because they didn't let me go. My mom could not do anything about it, neither. My anxiety actually lowered a little but I was feeling like a complete zombie. When I was still in the clinic I found a shrink who was also a professor, like the best shrink in a region. He was a really good man, the first time we met we were talking about jazz for an hour before starting talking on the topic of my illness. He was kind of *the* *main guy* in the clinic and he told the shrink at my department to switch my medication to Clozapine and add SSRIs. Also he suggested him using some other meds like lithium. When I was finally free from the nuthouse I was on a ton of medication but my state at least became bearable. I've lost around 44 pounds in three months even though I was fed with tremendous amounts of antipsychotics all the time. That was just because they didn't feed us well. They actually didn't have any money to feed us well. \n\nSo... When I got home my mom told me that there's almost no time left until the exams and that I have to study in order to pass them. I guess I don't need to tell you I didn't want to. I just wanted some rest. But I was forced to, because she and my step-dad told me that if I don't enter the university they stop giving me money for food and stuff and I will have to find a job. Don't get me wrong tho, my mother is a good person, she was just lost and thought that if I don't do anything at all my mental state will only worsen, and my step-dad was putting pressure on her also, he didn't understand shit, he thought that mental illness is like a bad mood or something and that it's just *in my head.*  So I had no choice. I just picked the subjects I was best at, took some private lessons to improve my chances on the exams and passed them successfully. Actually I even got high enough score to apply to several universities in the closest big city on a free basis, but I chose the most prestigious one and my step-dad paid for my first year.  It got worse after that. I was still on antipsychotics, so I didn't have much anxiety, but every day I was getting more and more depressed and apathetic. I started skipping classes, but my initial knowledge allowed me to go through the first year without getting kicked out. By the end of that year I started drinking frequently again, got dragged into the bad company where all the people were using (mostly uppers), and my good friend who was renting a flat with me got dragged in there too. I managed to stay off the hard drugs which he didn't and I still feel sorry for that. My feelings started to fade more and more, even though I thought that I've had none of them left. It was like, everything in this world had some feeling to it. The chair, the room, the sound of wind or laughter. A very specific feeling. And all those emotional shades started to decay more and more, every day I felt less alive and it was frightening me. I still had all the basic feelings aside from pleasure, like fear and fury or even sadness (which was the best feeling I could experience but even sadness was a rare thing, mostly it was fear), but the absence of those emotional semitones made me feel less real and less human. I was constantly telling my mom I want to drop out of university and just have some rest, maybe get off meds which were causing too much side effects (in two years time I became morbidly obese), but she could not let me do that, mainly because of my step-dad who has paid for my studying. On the third year of studying (by that time I transferred to another faculty which was easier in terms of subjects and all) I've managed to get off meds. I went through terrible withdrawals. Clozapine withdrawal just made me see things and didn't let me sleep for three to four days in a row and SSRIs... Well I can't even imagine anything worse than Venlafaxine withdrawals. That was just one and a half months of pure hell. But I went through it. I went to the gym and lost some weight and as my mother said back then became a lot more alive, but after I stopped taking clozapine I've developed persistent insomnia. I didn't want to go back on meds so I turned to smoking weed every night to help me fall asleep. At first, it was working, but then I've started abusing it. For seven months I smoked a gram per three days and was stoned all the time aside from the time when I was studying. My emotions kept fading. Sometimes I experienced a rush of motivation but mostly I was really apathetic. I've managed to quit weed but my state didn't get better. Well, maybe my studying did, but that's all. Around the time I've started smoking pot I've also started researching all the stuff about Buddhism and all, my worldview has changed drastically and now I think of reality just the way any regular acid user does. But it didn't help either. I'm thankful for one thing - I found a person who I think was meant for me. She is supportive and kind, although she has her problems, too. If it wasn't for her I think I would be dead by now. But even though I love her, I don't feel that I love her, neither do I feel anything else. Just anxiety and fear, dread, sometimes. I've got nervous tics (is that how I call them?) and because of them it always looks like I'm making faces, also one of my teeth is going to fall out soon because I'm clenching my jaw too much. It always feels like there are thousands of thoughts going through my head at once and I can't really focus on one of them. I don't know what to do because my three-year experience with meds was terrible (I think I've tried almost every popular antipsychotic and antidepressant out there) and the last time I was trying to do therapy the guy just told me he could not help after like fifteen sessions and eight hundred bucks later. The only thins which gave me the feeling I am craving for, that feeling of comfort and reality were light opioids like codeine and kratom, but I don't want to engage in that kind of stuff either because I know it won't end well. I'm still hopeful, tho. I really do think that life is about balance and when this agony ends I will be happier than ever, but now I guess I just want to talk it all out and maybe get some advice. \n\nTo the one who reads this until the end: firstly, - thank you. And secondly, - sorry for the dramatic writing and all those parcellations, lol. I didn't even notice *how* I was writing this text. I used to write short stories so I guess it's just a habit. And sorry for all the mistakes in the text, too. I know there are tons of them as I'm usually unable to even formulate my thoughts in Russian properly when I'm writing for so long. If you hurt just as I do - don't lose your hope, ever. I can't explain why, but, well... Just don't. Gonna go to bed now. So good night to anyone who reads this. I wish you all well.",

        "text": "Last night my head felt really weird so I posted a few posts on different subreddits complaining about my anti-psychotics pills being upped to Clozapine for schizophrenia but they still make me really paranoid,\n\nThe comments on r/magick subreddit made me get really paranoid about them so I flushed 2 and a half weeks worth down the toilet and was planning on going cold turkey but this morning I could feel my brain tricking me after missing 3 dosages and got really scared,\n\nThe clozapine is court ordered and one of the rules is if I throw them away or destroy them the doctor has a right to institutionalise me for 3 years (the court said I either had to go on clozapine or be institutionalised) so I rang my mum because I was scared I was going to hurt someone or myself. \n\nMy mum has rang the doctor behind my back saying she doesn't know what I've done with the meds, so I got 2 weeks prescription and now have to take them at a facility every day rather than at home so now I have to take them. \n\nIf my blood test shows that I don't have the 300mgs a day in my system they are going to throw me in an institute. \n\nI can't trust anyone now everyone has betrayed me, I feel so scared I don't know what to do.\nMy friend is going to let me stay at his house so nobody knows where I am, I feel so betrayed now I know even my mum is on their side and only wants me in this world as a zombie wtf.\n\nWhen I miss my blood test on Saturday I think there will be a warrant for my arrest. Does anyone know the best way to make sure they won't be able to find me. Will they be able to read what I say on reddit? If so I'll have to delete this account. \n\nDoes anyone know how to trick blood tests to show anti psychotics levels in blood?\n\nWhat should I do the last 2 days my mind is slipping and I don't wanna go through psychosis.  I think it's coming because my mum says I'm really delusional again but I can't trust her my friend says I'm fine. But last night I had 2 minor hallucinations which where not bad but its usually a sign of bad things happening.\n\nCan I be tracked if I move city or does warrants work through counties (I'm in England)\n\nI'm gunna snap. Iv been forced to take the 100mg that I missed last night and the 200 that I missed at dinner time all at once so I'm drugged up atm but have not felt this paranoid since I first started taking chlorpromazine 5 years ago.  My friend keeps laughing at something then looking at me, what would the benefit for him be if he grassed me in?\n\nI can't even go home to pack because my mums there and she will ring the police.",

        "text": "Essentially what the title says. I went through some pretty intense, suicidal depression as a teenager, which gradually got better during my first and only  \"relationship\" (of sorts), culminating in a four month period of mania, since which for about half a decade (no thanks, perhaps, to a year and a half of consistent drug use, like MDMA, cocaine, ketamine, and weed) of emotional flatness, occasional months of what I guess you would call \"depression\" (extreme low mood everyday). Right now, I live in the UK mental health system, and have just undergone another four month period of mania after months in the system, in which I spent over a grand on music and wrote literally hundreds of poems and other written things. This past week, I've been waking up feeling Godawful, ridiculously heavy to the point that it hurts to move my arms and eyes, very low mood, and I've been sleeping during the day more often than not despite getting full night's sleeps every night. To me, it seems this period of \"mania\" was just about as long as the last one, so I'm wondering if there's a pattern here.\nHaving my symptoms described to you like this, do you reckon you could infer some sort of illness from what I've said? I'm still in the \"system\", and my doctor wants to start me on Clozapine, but there is no firm diagnoses yet, except that I had a first episode of psychosis three years ago (hallucinations, visual and audible daily for a period of weeks). \nI'm scared lads lol I don't want another five years of being a useless, uninspired, uncreative, impossible to talk too waste of oxygen. Could anyone help? \nThanks lads.",

        "text": "I have schizophrenia and bipolar. It has a special name that I can\u2019t spell. The first time in a long time I ended up having to hide in my dark bedroom all day because I couldn\u2019t take the hallucinations. I\u2019m used to seeing stuff here or there but everywhere I looked there was something off. Really scary stuff like the walls bubbling or what I call the smoke monster.\n\nLast couple weeks my bipolar symptoms got out of control. For almost 9 days I went from a elevated mood to manic. I went on a cleaning and purging stuff we didn\u2019t need binge. At first it was great and I kept telling my husband I might as well use my manic symptoms for good. I filled 17 trash bags from every part of my house and shed in two days. My husband kept telling me to stop but I was convinced I wasn\u2019t spiraling. It got to a point that I cleaned a part of the floor on my hands and knees for hours. Just picking up little dots on the floor the vacuum missed. This habit comes from being raised by a narcissistic physically abusive cleaning freak dad. He would have us brush the carpet with a little wire hair brush first on hands and knees then vacuum and then brush it again and the whole time we had to pick up the little dots. So I get stuck sometimes looking for them. My husband stopped me when he got home from work. \n\nThank goodness I only spent a few days low. With only about half a day of wanting to die. Which I absolutely reached out to my support system about.\n\nThen when I evened out I started psychotic symptoms hard core. \n\nI am so tired of being this way. I\u2019m on meds and see someone every month/sometimes two weeks. I spent a lot of time and med changes. With my anti psychotic I have tried everything new and old. Except for clozapine. Which I refuse. The side effects and what it does to your body is just to scary. I know my quality of life is far better medicated. Unmediated I go off the deep end and forget who I am until I get my meds built back up in my system.\n\nMy husband keeps telling me that I\u2019m just gona have bad days or weeks. He has realized a pattern with my monthly cycles on the bipolar symptoms. And psychotic hits randomly. He wants me to stop hating myself. Or telling myself to be better.\n\nI still very much believe that this is all my fault. That I\u2019m not pushing through stuff hard enough. And I can\u2019t seem to let go of the fact that I will never have a life or brain like I did before onset of sickness. \n\nI think I\u2019m in the stages of grief. Has any of you made it past this point? Forgiven yourself and learned to accept things for how they are. If so how did you do it? What do you tell yourself when you have a bad day? Do you get over the guilt you feel seeing your loved ones take care of you or worry about you?\n\nAny insight is helpful. I saw 3 therapist in the run of five years and that didn\u2019t help with any of these feelings.",

        "title": "Hello, my psychiatric experience, over time, years . . .",
        "text": "LIES, THAT INFEST PSYCHIATRY\n\nPOOR DOCUMENTATION, REGARDING THE DRUGS\n\nPsychiatric drugs are often said to give heightened prolactin in 1 %, or maybe 10 % of patients. This is false, for several reasons . . The biggest one is, that psychiatric drugs block the D2 - dopamine receptor ( there are five dopamine receptors, called D1 - D5, D2 is the one that is considered ' anti - psychotic ', ie. blocking that inhibits psychotic behavior, and more ) . . We know from science, that skizophreniacs don't have more dopamine in the brain, than healthy people, R. Whitaker mentions this, and as such blocking it should have no effect, on psychosis, at least directly. I have been on several anti-psychotics, and I have never felt any lessening of psychotic symptoms, or reductions in degree, of delusions . . The patients I meet in the hospital also don't seem to get ' better ', they keep saying the same, crazy things, no matter how much ' medicine ', they get, I have never met a person, who got ' sane ', on the pills . . The second thing is, that it only increases prolactin in maybe 1 %, or 10 %, of patients . . This is scientifically false, as dopamine is an active ' brake ' on prolactin, meaning the second you inhibit D2 - receptors, prolactin always rises, except in a very small group of people, that have an abnormal dopamine transmission, have a flawed dopamine system, in the brain . . That means, that all the anti-psychotics, including clozapine, and Abilify causes prolactin to rise, as a physiological fact, in all  humans, almost . . This is documented in a youtube talk, by a young doctor, who explains how the dopamine system works. A second problem is, that hypeprolactinemia is defined as ' above normal range ', which is Danish units is 450 mIU/L, for males, I think it is 20 units, in American standards, or numbers . . So, if a drug causes prolactin to increase, but inside this range, as the drugs Abilify, and clozapine should do, because they have weak ' inhibition ' numbers for this receptor, that might be the cause, for the low number, despite it happening . .\n\nThe second problem is, drug companies are only required to measure prolactin after 12 hours, or 24 hours, by the FDA . . So, any early spike, that is gone quickly, is ' described ' as being 1 %, or even 0 %, because of this flaw . . Clozapine has a spike, that is actually hyperprolactinemia, in a 2003 research article, above 450 mIU/L, in 6 out of 6 patients, on 300 mg clozapine, which is lower than the average dose, in Britain, which 450 mg, per day, in patients . . I have complained about psychiatric drugs always increasing my prolactin, and doctors have told me, that's psychotic, it doesn't do that . . According to medical science, it always does that, in 100 % of people, humans, and most mammals, as well . . So, if a drug gives a massive prolactin spike, but it has fallen to about 300 mIU/L prolactin ( below 450 mIU/L, upper normal range ), after 12 hours, the ' incidence ' is 0 %, or 1 % . . This is false, fraudulent . .\n\nThere is also the case, of the CAFE study, where they compared an old drug, to a new drug, and ' accidentally ' compared a low dose, of the new drug, to an equivalent ' high ' dose, of an older drug, ' equivalent ' dosages . . That made the new drug look better, than the older drugs, and it was marketed as such, as a revolutionary ' second - generation ' drug . . But, when FDA researchers checked the ' facts ', and compared a high dose of the old drugs, to a similar dosage, equivalent dosage, of the new drugs, they found very little difference . . The older drugs caused more movement disorders, problems, like ticks, spasms, but the newer drugs were worse, in terms of prolactin, hormone - problems . . That was the CATIE study, and the researches concluded the ' new anti - psychotics ', the second-generation drugs, were a clever lie, told to sell, and deceive health care funds, and governments, globally, a theft really, massive . . So, another problem in psychiatry is, that the companies have often lied, to sell more, and justify the price, of their newer ' patent - drugs ', for profit . . This means that the data, from the pre-clinical trials aren't guaranteed to be ' good ', and according to the Danish FDA, they put especial focus on those trials, because they know how many got the drugs, during those trials, precisely, and what other drugs they got, can ' restrict ' the test - subjects, so it's more valid . . In later studies, often it is difficult to find ' clean ' patients, many have other diseases, there are age differences, smoking, other such things, that complicate things, scientifically . . The Danish FDA writes that they put more emphasis on pre-clinical trials, for that reason, because they're more controlled . . That has implications for the validity, of the side-effect profile, released to the public, and it's veracity . . At least in regards to prolactin, the documentation is utterly flawed, a sham . . 100 % of patients, almost, experience an increase in prolactin, according to basic, medical science, that is taught in most medical schools . . It's physiology, ' body '-medical-science, in another word . . . Because of the flawed nature, of how drugs are documented, the definition of ' hyperprolactinemia ', and also the requirement to only test after 12 hours, or 24 hours after giving it, the drug, in pre-clinical trials, many drugs are under-reported, critically . . . The number should be 100 %, less if one uses the ' strict ' definition of hyperprolactinemia, as the ' standard ', but that misses clear spikes, that are scientifically valid, important, and strong . . Basically, this is poor documentation, fraud, and deceit . .\n\nPROLACTIN AND THE MATERNAL INSTINCT, MATERNAL BEHAVIOR\n\nI have gotten several anti-psychotics, and always complained I felt like a pregnant woman, hormonally . . I developed sensitive, sore nipples, lactated a few times, became very prone to crying, especially when seeing puppies, kittens, cute animals, and babies . . According to women, describing pregnancy, this is exactly what happens . . I also developed homosexual ' ideations ', and one might think, women become less sexually interested, during pregnancy, but it is actually the opposite . . In the first three months, there's less interest, because of nausea, bodily changes, other things, ' morning ' sickness . . But, in the second and third trimester, women generally describe an above-normal interest in sex, and intercourse, with their male partners, doctors describe this as well, and call the women that experience this, not all do, ' lucky ', ' fortunate ', and blessed . . As a man, I found that repulsive, and humiliating, embarassing . . I developed interest in anal-sex, with me receiving it, from other men, kissing men, and holding hands, with men, just like a pregnant . .\n\nI have found over 100 scientific articles, saying prolactin changes ' mood, emotions, and behavior ', towards ' pregnancy ', ' mothering ' . . Yet, this side-effect, or ' natural ' consequence, hasn't been recorded on any anti-psychotic, despite it increasing in 100 %, of patients, physiologically . . I find it odd, that 40 million skizophreniacs, 1 % of the global population, and half of that, for the males, 40 million people, and all those people outside this group, that also got anti-psychotics, that not one of them has experienced this, because this is written, as absent, on all anti-psychotics, across the spread . . Not a single anti-psychotic, not even risperidone, which gives the most prolactin, of any psychiatric drug, has this mentioned as a side-effect, even in 0.01 %, or 0.001 %, of patients . . That's a lie, a direct deceit, as 100 % of patients experience this, in differing degrees, or extents . . So, there are massive flaws in the documentation, and even things doctors know from medical school WILL happen, aren't reported, even as 0.001 % of patients getting . . I find it strange, that you can make 40 million men into homosexuals odd, without even on in 10.000 complaining . . I conclude, it is intentional, clear fraud, that psychiatry knows about this, doesn't care, and cause male homosexuality, in 100 % of the patients, because that makes them easier to handle, ' less ' trouble . . In fact, since D2 - dopamine receptors is the only dopamine receptor responsible for prolactin increase, the D1, D3, D4, and D5 receptors don't change prolactin, when inhibited, I think it's the point, of the therapy, since it doesn't cure delusions, the dopamine system isn't sick, not the problem . .\n\nHere's a link to those 100 articles, saying prolactin causes maternal ' behavior ', or male homosexuality, as science . . They're degrading mental patients, with cruel, barbaric treatments, globally, sadly . .\n\nDownload link, copy into Internet Explorer : [https://gofile.io/?c=dke6xD](https://gofile.io/?c=dke6xD)\n\nThis documents, since 40 articles are by doctors, medical professionals, 40 articles are by other scientists, biologists, biochemists, pharmacologist, and the last 20 articles, are by journalists, other non-scientists, that quote this research, and that it is public knowledge, that psychiatry changes men into homosexuals, hormonally, for convenience, ease . .\n\nWhen they did that to me, because I played too many video games, and got so excited, I made noise, disturbed the neighbors, so they couldn't sleep, I felt like this, in my soul . .\n\nHow prolactin feels, as a soul : [https://gofile.io/?c=hW28TM](https://gofile.io/?c=hW28TM)\n\nOften, on the high dosages, this lasted 22 - 23 hours, a day, and I was in hell, utterly tortured . . On 10 mg olanzapine, it lasted 8 - 9 hours, on 15 mg, it lasted 14 - 16 hours, and on 20 mg, it lasted 22 - 23 hours, each day . . I think the doctors know this, since the ' sedating ' effects were gone, pretty early, but the hormones stayed, and did the ' damage ' . . I think anti-psychotics are an excuse, to pump men full of pregnancy hormones, so they become more managable, easier, to deal with . . This fits well with how anti-psychotics don't really cure psychosis, but, it seems like a way to cripple, and humiliate men hormonally, by turning them into ' pregnant ' women, with pharmaceuticals . . This happens in 100 % of mental patients, according to science, and this ' side - effect ' isn't recorded on ANY anti-psychotic, ever . . I think it's the goal, with the drugs, at least in me, they made me tired until the morning, even on 20 mg, high dosage olanzapine . . The effect that remained, until the next pill, was the hormones, those effects . . This is something every serious medical practicioner should know, and to think psychiatry as a big organization, run by doctors, that are especially interested in how molecules, and hormones affect behavior, wouldn't know this, is basically a lie, they ' count ' on it, to debase, destroy, and torture patients, to make them more compliant, or ' easy ', to manage . . It's the oldest trick in the medical book, hormones, and how they work . . Prolactin is basically an ' estrogen ', only specific for pregnancy, and maternity . . Same effect, in the male brain, though, homosexuality, same-sex interests, and desires . . . I think anti-psychotics are designed to give ' prolactin ', and not cure psychosis, which isn't possible, with a simple pill, not, at all . . According to science, this is what always happens, in 100 % of patients, everywhere . . I wonder, it seems ' odd ', weird . . When a man is constantly ' assaulted ', by homosexual desires, he is weak, ' manageable ', and doctors rely on this, to ' sedate ' them, calm them . . At least according to all science, this is what happens, in patients . . And, it feels like hell, or torture . .\n\nPsychiatry ignores this pain, lies about it, and continues to do harm, and often patients deserve 10 mg, but it's just easier to give 20 mg, look away, and ignore the pain, by the doctors, nurses . . A quicker day, less work, all too easy, and simple . . The pain is real, and the doctors lie, deceive . . That has been my CONSISTENT experience of psychiatry, the only real constant, is the hormones, the ' sex - changes ', for convenience, a ' quicker ' day, by the nurses . . They often laugh, visibly, when they see men behave like that, ' become ' homosexuals, but dismiss it when asked, directly . . They sometimes say, if you don't shut up about the side - effects, we'll increase the dosage . . Which, means more hell, more hours, passed in torture, and dissolution, as a ' man'  . . .\n\nSo, here's LIE number one . . Anti-psychotic heal the mind . . No, they main, and scar the mind, at least in men, and ' degrade ' them, by turning them into ' hormonal ' homosexuals . . It is UTTERLY humiliating, and PAINFUL, all good doctors know this, the female doctors know it from themselves, both in theory, and from their own pregnancies, and they constantly lie about it, to get away with pumping patients full of these things, often for laziness, when a patient is crippled, riddled with pain, in spirit, they're less active, more ' sedate ', and this means less work, even if it's criminal . . We know psychiatry has always used brutal means, like lobotomies, metrazole injections, and other things . . Psychiatry is just as barbaric today, they just use chemicals, instead of surgery, that cause intense pain, instead of curing, or healing . . The 3 images above, about how it felt, is an accurate picture, based on mindfulness, of how I felt for 22 - 23 hours, each day, on drugs that were supposed to help me, ' cure ' me . . I didn't feel cured, I felt annihilated, chemically, as a soul, no less . .\n\nABILIFY - DOES IT CAUSE HALLUCINATIONS\n\nAbilify is approved for 30 mg, as the maximum dosage, since 2003, at least in America . . Despite this, I was given 45 mg, in a Danish hospital, and was not informed . . This caused me to hallucinate, for many hours, each night, like and LSD - trip . . For those who don't know LSD - trips, I read about it, and it causes ' trips ' that last many hours, often up to 12 hours, because LSD gets ' stuck ' in the serotonin receptors ( 5-HT2a, 5-HT2c, I think ), and ' can't get out, chemically . . That is why LSD trips last much longer than other drugs, that effect . . Also, LSD is known to ' show ' what is inside a person's soul, or mind, their ' sub-conscious ' . . A scuba-diver might see dolphins, a brick-layer may see mortar, or bricks, and a singing-teacher might see hallucinations, of notes, musical sheets . .\n\nOn that dosage, I saw newborns, infants . . The reason is, Abilify inhibits the D2 receptor, like all anti-psychotics, and that caused prolactin, the hormone responsible for the maternal instinct, to rise, physiologically . . What do pregnant women think about all the time, instinctually, their babies, the newborns, the child . . So, because Abilify is ' pharmacological ' LSD, at the higher dosages, I saw that, and because I watch a lot of computer, play games, I saw it as three ' monitors ', hanging a meter in front of me, in the air . . I saw ' myself ', in the images, or hallucinations, which is exactly what LSD does, according to both science, and drug users, describing what it does, in the mind, the brain . .\n\nI talked to another girl, in the hospital, a few days ago, and told her I had hallucinations, on Abilify . . She said she had that too, and they had to stop the treatment, it made her sick, the doctors removed the treatment, she ' got ' ill, hallucinated, specifically she saw people, and objects that weren't their, clear psychosis . . So, on the higher dosages, Abilify might also promote psychosis, and not cure it, and cause permanent damage to the patient's ability to ' perceive ' reality, something LSD is know to do, cause permanent psychosis, or hallucinations . . For me, these drug-induced ' visions ' lasted all night, surprising to most people who don't know drugs, that it lasts that long, but LSD is known to do that, in most people, it's established science, and recognized by users . . I have never done drugs, so I didn't know that, never wanted to . . So, ironically something marketed as an ' anti-psychotic ' is actually a ' pro-psychotic ', and hurts people's minds, at least on the higher dosages . . I have found articles, saying other people have gotten 60 mg, or even 75 mg, though they have been informed, before being given above-approved dosages, which I wasn't . .\n\nBecause the hallucinations, of babies, were accompanied by intense sexual arousal, because the drug, Abilify, also causes hypersexuality, I wanted to masturbate all the time, while I saw images, of babies, newborns . . Three weeks after being on Abilify, I tried to jump from a 7th floor window, the glass didn't break, luckily . . My parents saw I was crying, shaking, shivering, in a corner, couldn't speak, so they told the doctor to stop . . He stated, it's the psychosis that's coming out, he's resisting it, because he clings to his delusions, his ' disease ', but the DRUG is fixing it, ' pulling ' it out, like a bad tooth, or ' bad ' nails, on the toes . . He needs to get 60 mg, Abilify, and he'll be CURED, said the doctor . . My dad gave him a withering look, and said, THIS ENDS NOW, OR ELSE . . And, the doctor, being a little insecure, nervous, about himself stopped . . Now, I know the images of the babies, and the sexual arousal were disconneted, I wasn't interested in sex, with newborns, on the drug . . They were separate, not ' connected ' . . But, over those three weeks, they sort of ' grew ', and on the last night, I briefly touched my penis, because of the drugs . . For a moment, I was a ' real ' pedophile ', towards babies, newborns, and I RESENT that, HATE it . . The drug was supposed to make me clear, in the brain, instead it hurt me, as a soul . .\n\nHere are the links, to how LSD works ( by affecting serotonin - system ) :\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic\\_acid\\_diethylamide#Pharmacology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide#Pharmacology)\n\nAnd, how Abilify works in the same receptors, in the brain :\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aripiprazole#Pharmacology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aripiprazole#Pharmacology)\n\nIt is unknown how LSD causes these hallucinations, precisely, so it's not possible to say if Abilify does this, I experienced a ' classic ' LSD trip, so did another girl I talked to, a few days ago, 2020-02-13, in Denmark . . I think Abilify, on the higher dosages, is a potent pro-psychotic, and not safe for mental patients, or people in general, my experience . .\n\nWorst case scenario, Abilify can cause a person to live permanently, in a psychotic world, something LSD is known to do, in rare cases . . This goes back to how the drugs aren't properly documented, before they're sold . . This lack of quality, in the documentation, kills people, and the doctors don't care, not really . .\n\nCan any professional, who understands drugs, help me understand if Abilify can cause these hallucinations, or LSD - trips, pharmaceutically . . I'm not an expert, don't know a lot . . . If someone were to ask, how many people have experienced hallucinations on Abilify, it could shut down that drug, all sales, in an instant . . The number is probably 10 %, if not more, maybe 40 - 50 %, or higher . . I also had mild hallucinations, on 15 mg, that were very brief, but there . . That's an approved dosage, and the drug is dangerous, toxic . .\n\nOn a side note, during those hallucinations, I first ' experienced ' being able to be ' outside ' my mind . . Over time, that has slowly developed into a psychosis, that I can trasmit, and receive thoughts, over great distances . . That ' feeling ', of being ' outside ' myself, physically, started when I got 45 mg, during those hallucinations . . Today, I am permanently psychotic, delusional, because of Abilify, probably, marketed as an anti-psychotic . . The very diseases they claim to cure, they cause, with their drugs . .\n\nDANISH DOCTORS ONLY REPORT 2 % OF SERIOUS OR UNEXPECTED SIDE-EFFECTS\n\nUnder law, Danish doctors are required to report serious ( life-threatening, leading to longer hospital admissions, that serious ) side-effects, to the FDA, by law, it's a felony, to not do it, as a Danish doctor . . They are also REQUIRED to report unknown side-effects, as these can be very important, for other patients, save lives, even . . Yet, in 2017, 2018, and 2019, that number was only 2 %, according to the Danish FDA, of mandatory reporting . . Nurses, non-doctors report even less, about half that, and there are more of them, nurses, than doctors . . So, the other staff reports even less, less than 2 % . . . Denmark has one of the best health-care systems in the world, and one wonders, at the global standard, and realizes that we have no reliable numbers, for the incidence of side-effects, once it is given to millions, those numbers don't exist . . And, if a doctors considers a side-effect neither ' serious ', or ' unknown ', it gets reported less . . What this means is, one would think as doctors give this drug, to millions, we start getting good numbers, for how often serious, unknown side-effects occur, we ' get the ' number, but that never happens, doctors don't do their job, sadly . . It's described in this slide, by the Danish FDA, to Danish medical students . . Note, that in 2003 - 2004, Danish doctors reported 1 %, of SERIOUS, or UNKNOWN side-effects, it was worse then, and this reflects poorly on the number, globally, as well . .\n\nPowerpoint slide series to Danish medical student, only 2 % of side-effects are reported : [http://slideplayer.dk/slide/14043696/](http://slideplayer.dk/slide/14043696/)\n\nThis again validates, that the documentation regarding the drugs is flawed, potentially harmful . . This sloth, as I have talked about these side-effects I've had, for the last 10 years, has cost lives, made people psychotic, injured people . . I asked the Danish FDA about three months ago, has any health-worker reported any side-effects about me, and gave them my social security number, which they are required to write, when reporting for a patient, when reporting, the doctors . . In my case, the number was zero, no reports, ever . . . Even though I have complained about hallucinations, suicide, chemical homosexuality, and worse, for over then years, by now . . That's the standard, in psychiatry, but the 2 % number is for ALL Danish doctors, not just psychiatrists, and that has implications, for drug - safety, everywhere, on the planet, liver-medicine, kidney-medicine, anything . . . If a drug - company wants to cheat, sell a harmful drug, they can do it, because it never gets discovered, the doctors don't care, patients die, and it's malpractice, highly criminal, and fraud . . .\n\nABOUT CLOZAPINE, CALLED LEPONEX IN DENMARK, EUROPE\n\nClozapine is called Leponex, in other countries . . What does the word lepo mean, in latin, that Danish doctors are still being taught in medical school, I asked a medical student yesterday, 2020-02-13 as of writing . . The word lepo means ' scale ', and nex means ' death ', ' execution ', in latin, using google translate :\n\nlepo : scale\n\nlepris : leprous\n\nnex : deaths\n\nNow, leponex does not cause patients to develop large scales, or ' flaking ' . . And clozapine patients certainly don't die, from scaly skin, or becoming ' scaly ' . . However, when one looks at leprosy, it is caused by a bacteria, and most of the damage it causes, happens because of the bacteria ' damaging ' nerves, or nerve fibers . . The disaese leprosy is named from the word, in latin, for scale, ' lepo ', see this link :\n\nMeaning of the word, in this link : [https://wordinfo.info/unit/1167](https://wordinfo.info/unit/1167)\n\nSee more information, in this link, varioous resources I found online, after searching for the words : [https://gofile.io/?c=zLcREn](https://gofile.io/?c=zLcREn)\n\nThis refers to the nerve damage, where the bacteria damages the nerve myelin sheets, causing them to fall off, like flakes, scales . . So, what does this have to do with leponex, well it causes diabetes, often very aggressive diabetes . . Diabetes causes four kinds of harm, especially vascular damage, to the small blood vessels, NERVE damage, ocular damage, and kidney damage . . So, what does leponex mean in doctors language, they know the names of bodily organs, in latin, and diseases too . . Well, clozapine, lepo-nex means ' leper - death ', they cause the same damage as leprosy, just with diabetes, instead . . Or, more precisely, ' leper - execution ' . . It's a slow, progressing disease, where you lose sense of touch, slowly, but nerve activity to internal organs are also damaged, including to the heart, leading to angina, chest pains, from an injured nerve, and blood supply, and vascular dementia, to the brain . . It is slow, agonizing, and utterly terrifying, probably the worst form of execution you can invent, and psychiatry has used it since 1972, when it was marketed, to the world . . So, when a doctor gives a patient leponex, he's really thinking, ' chemical leprosy execution, or death ', as a professional . . If you go look at people, that have gotten diabetes from clozapine, for many years, they should look like lepers, almost . . Amputations, blindness, badly working internal organs, and more . . Not all get this, but according to some science, leponex causes diabetes in 55 %, of patients, and the Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines in Psychiatry says, risk of diabetes is high . . The Danish FDA says it only causes diabetes, in 0.1 % of patients, and one starts to realize, that the drugs aren't badly documented, but actively fraudulent, to enable psychiatrists to do these things, as they want . . I think psychiatry is just as bad, as it ever was, the damage they cause is simply more subtle, from the outside it might appear like the person just ' is that way ', has many diseases . . But, they've been caused by the drug, intentionally, by doctors . . If you go to a closed psychiatric ward, for the criminally insane, you'll see lepers, artificially created, with drugs . . Not all patients get it, but there are articles, where patients develop life-threatening diabetes, on dosages of 50 - 150 mg, in 7 - 10 days, of getting the drug . . Recommended dose range is 200 - 800 mg, in some countries, in others it's 150 - 950 mg . . Psychiatry performs inhumane, agonizing executions, with chemical, and cover it up, to make sure patients take the ' medicine ', without complaining, or fuss . . The whole thing runs on lies, deceit, and murder . . . The same thing with anti-psychotics, that create ' chemical ' homosexuality, they cover it up, to ' trick ' patients, into taking the drugs, that aren't helpful, or healing, in any way, at all . .\n\n\" Clozapine was first made in 1956, and sold commercially in 1972.\\[10\\]\\[11\\] \"\n\nSource, wikipedia : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clozapine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clozapine)\n\nSo yes, psychiatry is as evil as it ever was, often worse . . . The damage just occurs under the skin, so you can't see it, or think it's the patient, who has those problems, that's all . . They need to lie about, to get away with, and the FDA is helping them do, because they have approved the diabetes incidence, of 0.1 %, though it is reported as 55 %, or 39 %, in research articles . . It's not possible to get such wildly varying numbers, regarding something so simple as diabetes, they just have to measure blood sugar, before, and after, so someone's lying, almost certainly, and giving the name of leponex, it's probably the FDA, the doctors . . If it became known how dangerous clozapine really is, they wouldn't be able to sell it, anywhere . . So, they lie, to the public, hide the data, deceive, so the patients are more compliant, take the ' drugs ', thinking it is medicine, a ' curative ' . .\n\nVALPROATE - A MOOD-STABILIZER THAT ALSO STERILIZES\n\nI was put on this mood-stabilizer, when I finally convinced my doctors I wasn't delusional, merely had mania, was impulsive . . It worked really well, for 3 - 4 months, then the effect disappeared . . I mentioned this to my doctors, but they insisted I keep taking, anyway . . The same problem occurs with anti-depressants, for me they worked well the first day, really well, actually, the second day there was 5 - 10, maybe 15 % effect and, on the third day, they simply didn't work, less than clear water, which is refreshing, a bit . . No effect, and research supports this Peter Goetzsche, R. Whitaker knows him, has documented this, and there are massive gaps, in the documentation . . However, about valproate, the mood-stabilizer, it is given for epilepsy, dose range 600 - 1200 mg, according to the Danish FDA, for mental patients it is recommended for 1000 - 2000 mg . . In 2003, it was found, this it caused testicular atrophy, in this article :\n\n\" However, after correcting for changes in body mass index (BMI), the testicular size/BMI ratio was lower in the valproate-treated patients. \" Tested in 60 male patient . .\n\nSource : [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12940829](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12940829)\n\nThe research was more conclusive, in 2015, where they found that it castrates, with overwhelming certainty . .\n\nArticle title : Seminal fluid analysis and testicular volume in adults with epilepsy receiving valproate - 2015.\n\n\" Compared to controls, patients had lower levels of free testosterone (p<0.01), sperm concentration (p<0.0001) and count (p<0.0001), carnitine (p<0.01), and testicular volume (p<0.01), and higher rates of immotile sperm (p<0.001) and abnormal forms (p<0.0001). \" Tested in 60 patients, or close . .\n\n( p < 0.01 is science for, there's only 1 % chance, of this not happening, in patients and, p < 0.0001 means there's less than 0.01 % chance, of those things not happening, scientifically ) . .\n\nSource : [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636832](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636832)\n\nAs of 2020, this side-effect has been reported, in Denmark, and it has a male infertility indicence, of 0.1 %, no mention of lowered sperm quality, sperm damage, anything . . So, what does this lead to . . This very simple fact, psychiatry is lying about side-effects, to main, and cripple patients, with chemicals . . And it is not much better than it was, in the days of lobotomies, or more humane . . It's the same, sadly . .\n\nWhen I started talking to other patients, men that became homosexuals on anti-psychotics, I was told it was not permitted, and we were shuffled to other wards, in the hospital . . I think psychiatry does everything it can, to cover up these side-effects, and lie . . I think, it's intentional, designed . . A girl I met in the hospital, told me she had started hallucinating on Abilify, and had thought her doctor had reported it, for her, that it wasn't her job . . He probably didn't . . My neighbor is on valproate, long-acting injections, and he has gotten scrotal hernia, and his scrotum is inflamed, possibly because the drug is destroying his testicular tissues, and it has gotten infected, the dead, decaying tissue . . Psychiatrists are massively, intentionally overlooking these side-effects, to hurt patients, and I have never experienced anything else, but neglect, deceit . .\n\nThat is the truth, about psychiatry, I'm a survivor, a former drug developer, who found the science . . If this isn't deceit, lies, it's the worst case of medical malpractice, and sloth I have ever seen, in any branch of science, ever, in the world . . So, I conclude it's intentional, malicious . . . Psychiatry is made of very well-educated people, foremost in the world, and they know science, worship it . .\n\nI STARTED RECORDING IT, FOR DOCUMENTATION\n\nAbout five years ago, I complained to the Board of Patient Complaints, in the hospital . . I was not given my journal, or informed I had a right, to see it . . I tried to convince them I wasn't crazy, but 9 out of 10 complaints are denied, in psychiatry . . The second time I complained, I got a lawyer, and he told me he needed my hospital files, the medical ' records ', to get ready for the complaint . . I went up, told them my lawyer had asked for my hospital files, but they misunderstood it, and gave it to me, not my lawyer, by accident . . As I read it, I saw they had written things I hadn't really said, ' twisted ', the truth, and reading it, I saw it made me look crazy, though I had complained about other things, other issues . . .  also had the right to have it delivered, the week before the Patient Complaint ' Meeting ', which was on a tuesday morning, and I got it late in the afternoon, on a sunday, and had to read eighty pages of lies, exaggerations, and ' things I hadn't said, in that way ' . . The result was, when all the journal entries was put together, I sounded crazy, each little journal entry making it look worse, and worse, until I was sentenced, as crazy, by anyone reading it, I would have done that too, for sure . . That was when I started recording the ' talks ', also with the doctors, because I wanted to document what had been said, in the talks, before the Patient's Complaint Board, that's was all . . I have over 600 talks, with all staff, at a Danish mental hospital, going back five years now, complaining about these things, to everyone . . The last two years, I started video recording them, using spy cameras, hidden in cigarette packs, USB sticks, and sun - glasses, not because I ' hate ' them, mostly because I'm nervous about them lying, in my journal, which judges later read, during appeals, and so on . . A ' skewed ' hospital documentation, by the staff, can damn you, in any court, so I take precautions, that's all . .\n\nWhen they found out I was recording them, because I put it in Facebook, and they saw it, they confiscated my phone, and said it was ' illegal ', to record them . . The hospital general lawyer wrote the same, to me . . When I asked my personal lawyer, he said it was legal, so long as I did not record anything of a personal nature, and published that, such a private matters, health-problems, addresses, and so on . . So, I smuggled a phone in, concealed in a cake, and recorded them anyway, so there, Ha ha . . .\n\nLater, when I was in the hospital, they lied to the police, to confiscate my phone . . They claimed I had recorded the other patients, which was false . . I didn't need to record them, was not important to my case, and I didn't really care . . They were sad, sick, and I didn't benefit from recording that, or publishing it . . It would have been ' evil ', sick . . I never did that, it was bad, but the doctors lied to the police, so they took my phone, anyway . . So, I smuggled another phone in, and kept recording . .\n\nNow, I'm in another housing project, and I have recorded them as well, with about 500 hours of video recordings, where I show them the papers I have shown you, documenting what they do . . I have a court-order to take medicine, because I threatened them, and got in a few fights, after 5 years of torture, and also being castrated, with valproate, I thought they had killed me, and 5 years of prolactin-torture, I couldn't take it anymore . . One incident, I pushed the doctor, so he fell, and raised a fist at him, and ripped his shirt, a bit, on the shoulder . . I did that, because he put me on 15 mg olanzapine, from 10 mg, and that meant prolactin-torture, many hours daily, 14 - 16 hours, over 10 - 12 hours, on 10 mg . . This is real, because prolactin increases in 100 % of patients, almost, that receive medications that block the D2 - dopamine receptor, see above, and turns one into a chemical homosexual, which feels like burning in hell, in ones soul . . He reported that as an assault, and I am now on leponex, ' chemical leprosy ' treatments, instead . . Though he knew these things from medical, he never explained to the police, that my aggression towards him was provoked by increasing the dosage, and sending me to Hell, on hormones . . . He lied . . . .\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nI have shown all these documents to the staff, over the last five years, they keep insisting it's delusions, and maintain the court order, and medicate me . . In the end, I walked into a trap, I now have angina, chest-pains, from a faulty heart, and even though they know, they ignore it, keep ' treating ' me . . I don't think there's anything in the world that can convince a doctor you're not crazy, they simply refuse to listen, ignore it, even the best medical science in the world . . My latest doctor told me, in a recorded talk, that all that science meant nothing, his ' clinical experience ' was more important, and he refused to talk about the science, the 100 articles included above, about prolactin's psychoactive properties, as a maternal hormone, that incudes ' maternal moods, and behaviors ' . . I got put on anti-psychotics, because I fell in love with a video-game, completely, and started playing all day, all night, often made loud noises, and disturbed the neighbors . . I asked for a room, in the basement, after some time, so I could play without disturbing others, I was so in love with the game, Street Fighter, that I couldn't stop, so addicted . . For this dangerous, insane psychosis, ' loving ' video-games, I was put on anti-psychotics, and incinerated with hormones, something I will never forget, can't . .  I've been tortured, hormonally, for three, maybe four years, and that's all I remember, the torture . . In the end, they did it because it was easier, they didn't care . . By utterly crippling me, as a soul, they solved the problem with hard torture, and chemicals, that withered me . .\n\nThat's what psychiatry is, a place where they do all these things, and lie about it as much as they can, to ' lure in ' more patients, to ' trick ' them . . I've been tortured, grievously, and I will never forget it, the years feeling I was on fire, as a soul, a human being . . And, it's all science, constructed, by doctors, that want it, desire it . .",

        "text": "My main problems are anxiety, depersonalization and something I can only describe as a complete loss of emotional shades (I think people who are depersonalized will understand me) although recently I've become depressed as hell. I've tried various antidepressants, benzos and antipsychotics in the course of four or four and a half years, antipsychotics pretty much ruined my life and I've decided to quit everything altogether. I didn't quit cold turkey, but withdrawals were brutal as fuck. Especially venlafaxine, that was pure hell.\n\nNow I'm off meds for around two years, maybe one and a half. My sleep is back to normal (after I've stopped taking clozapine my sleep was gone for a long time and I've had to take sedatives), my weight is somewhat manageable and I look somewhat fit again. But my mental state is becoming worse. I've tried therapy, but it didn't work at all. My immune system is practically shutting down thanks to anxiety and low mood, recently I started getting palpations (I don't know if that's how you call it, I feel my heartbeat when I lie down), my motivation is gone completely and sometimes I feel really suicidal (never actually happened to me before, it's not just *thoughts* it's more like a *feeling*). \n\nI've visited a cardiologist recently just to check if my heart was okay, and when she saw my blood pressure she was shocked and asked how I was feeling, I told her about my anxiety and after talking a little I asked for the prescription for phenibut (in Russia it's a prescription drug). It's been seven days after I've started taking it in the 250mg/two times a day dosage, but today I've had to take 500mg in the evening because I was feeling just *too* shitty. I've also noticed that sometimes I crave alcohol just because it makes me numb and my anxiety becomes less prominent, I'm really afraid to get addicted and dependant on it although I don't drink too much (maybe two-three strong IPAs twice or once a week). So basically I've decided to get back on the medication so I don't get addicted to something really dangerous and in hopes that my life becomes somewhat bearable. Tomorrow I will be visiting a shrink, I know him for a very long time and he always listens when I suggest something and I'm here to ask you guys for some advice. I only need some substance to keep my anxiety on a leash for half of a year while I'm finishing university and then I will be able to fix my inner problems by myself. I was thinking about acid, as microdosing, when done properly, helped me a ton, but I'm afraid of it making my situation worse. Also considering Wellbutrin and Buspar, although there might be some problems getting the first one here in Russia. \n\nSorry for such a long post, I didn't intend to make it so huge. Also pardon me if the narration is messy, I just don't feel too well. If you have any advice on what I should do, if you can suggest some medication I could consider taking or you just want to share your story, you are very-very welcome. Thank you for reading.",

        "text": " Hi guys,  \n\n\nI am really worried as I feel I have been misdiagnosed with schizophrenia.  \n\n\nTo cut a very long story short around six years ago I was living at supported living organisation who had suspicions that I was stealing from them. This supported living organisation provided housing for people with severe learning disabilities; as my parents had barely been involved in my referral to the organisation and staff had no information on my background ( I barely talked), I think staff were particularly interested in me once they had suspicions I was stealing ( maybe thinking I had come from a background of neglect). The more I protested my innocence with regards to stealing, I think the greater curiosity ( as well as sense that I definitely *was* stealing, resulting in staff asking questions to those around them as to whether anybody knew about me; I think this had a huge ripple effect. Think this went on for a year until I was well known in the town I was residing.  \n\n\nEventually people realised I wasn't stealing but by that time I was well known so people kept watching me (rumours had spread that I was very disabled and delusional about looking after myself). Unfortunately, unbeknownst to me I spoke a load of rubbish in my sleep also which made things 100\\* worse, and I can understand why I provoked a lot of contempt from people( was sleeping in a basement bedroom in 12 person house; people who went outside to smoke could therefore hear me).  \n\n\nAnyway, mental health services do not believe this happened to me and do not believe anybody gives a \\*\\*\\*\\* about who I am. This has resulted in the past in me being prescribed awful anti-psychotics which have made me feel suicidal. although it sounds like exaggeration, they felt like torture ;I would have a constant restless sensation which could not be relieved no matter what I did and could not find enjoyment in anything because of this (only quetiapine has been okay which I have continually been on for the last two years and has no effect at all).  \n\n\nI believe rumours had recently sparked up again and therefore staff now want to give me clozapine. Unfortunately, I feel like I have to take this as I am currently off sick from work; work want consent with regards to my medical information so I feel like they definitely will not keep me on sick leave if I refuse.  \n\n\nIs this ringing any bells with anybody? \ud83d\udcf7",

        "text": "Alright, first time I'm truly putting this sensation into words so please bare with my spotty writing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo give a little background, I am a 21 year old relatively healthy female. My non-biological mother (we are not blood-related but she has raised me until the age of 18) has a slew of mental health illnesses that have directly impacted my childhood growing up in her household predominantly (divorced parents, so every other weekend at my normal father's house). We will refer to her with the alias \\**Zena.* From as early as I can remember living with Zena, I have seen some fucked up shit. From stabbing her then boyfriend (my step-father) in the head with a pair of scissors when I was 7 and when there was blood dripping from his head, Zena and he started laughing and said \"don't worry it's a prop!\"... to running down the stairs when I was 13 at 3 AM on a night of my birthday sleepover party, twitching viciously, with a chef's knife and the words \"whore\" written all over her nude body in red sharpie. I could write a whole forum on just these moments alone but we will refer to these moments as \"bad moons\" (what I would refer to them as since I was little). For as long as I can remember, when Zena would have explicitly violent bad moons (usually ones that require sedation of some sort, whether emergency psychiatric intervention or slipping crushed clozapine and valium into juices that I would have to coerce her into drinking), I would get overwhelmed with this weird pins and needles sensation throughout my whole body. After Zena is fast asleep and taken care of, I would just remember the most odd feeling of *floating* back up the stairs and going to sleep. It was as if I wasn't even the one walking. Sometimes I wouldn't even realize how I got back into my own bed, as if I was in some type of limbo outer-body sleep walking trance?? It was just so passive, I almost felt like a robot with no self awareness. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today. Sometimes (and over the past 3 years or so) I get in this weird, similar trance- like state of mind as when I was a kid floating back up those stairs. These trances come on during random times. During intercourse, at work in the middle of doing something, during very engaging conversations with friends. My eyes don't go cross-eyed and I just blank out in the middle of a task. It's not like that. Rather I continue on with the task but I lose the self-awareness that I'm even *doing* it. This has happened so much more often lately in conversations, which must be equally frustrating for whoever I'm talking to. For example, I will continue with the conversation, crack jokes, be normal .. and then 5 minutes later get looked at like i have three heads when I say \"Oh we've talked about that before\", as it'll be the topic of conversation we just had. This is especially stressful as I have been in a fresh relationship for the past 9 months, and I truly love my partner. However, because of these \"zone outs\" in conversation, he thinks I have zero serious interest or care about what he has to say because I \"forget everything.\" I just use a cop- out and blame it on my \"pothead memory\" but I smoke about 3 times a month, and I am very aware it is not that. Sometimes I even get confused looking in the mirror because I just look so.. foreign. It sometimes takes me a while to even realize that it's me?? If that makes any type of sense.  I have been told by numerous people over the last year or so I seem very \"out of it.\" It's gotten to the point that my father has had a sit-down intervention with me because he thought I was on heroin (??) because I am so quote by quote \"out of it all the time\" (does heroin even do that to you???)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am also starting  through these random moods where I don't want to speak in the middle of the day (and I am a VERY talkative extrovert, known by all my friends as the funny one). I feel in a weird sense that I'm shutting down... may I add these \"shutting down\" phases in the past were comforted by an excess of eating food, which led to 85 pounds of weight gain making me morbidly obese 5 years ago that I have since kept off (thank you ketosis). However, I secretly always knew it was a bit deeper than me just eating my trauma away from dealing with Zena's bad moods. \n\nThe excessive eating of the food and the motion of actually ingesting food made me feel alive. Right down to the extra feces I produced from eating all these extra foods and the stretch marks that starting forming on my skin from eating all these foods made me feel more \"real\"... more human? More alive. I'm literally trembling as I write this, and I have tried to lightly introduce these feelings of not feeling \"real\" to my close friends before - and I just get stared at like i have six heads. \n\nOn a separate note, suicidal ideation has always been pleasant type of thought I often find myself smiling to in the shower. The act of dying does not particularly appease to me (as they are not and nor have ever been **active**, suicidal thoughts) but rather the thought of people remembering me... as a *human* life that has since passed. There's a lot going on right now, such as legality issues which are taking a very heavy toll on me, to questioning my being from an existential standpoint, to the stress of college graduation in a week, to stepping on eggshells with every little thing I do regarding my father (completely sane, normal parental figure) whom I will being living with full time as I move back home from college. While I have a lot on my plate, I feel, rather... I **know** this is a lot more than just my anxiety building this time around. I have handled high-stress situations all my life but this feels different, and I think I should acknowledge it while I still have a grip on reality and recognize this is not normal before I completely become unaware of it. \n\nSo...am I just being a baby, or am I just full blown psychotic? I am eternally grateful for anything type of input xx",

        "text": "In the U.S. Unfortunately some of this I know first hand, much of this I'm hearing about. So my older brother is diagnosed with autism and schizophrenia. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia twenty years ago. He has been on clozapine, which has overwhelmingly worked, despite occasional relapses. Our mother said he was unbearable before being on the clozapine and would constantly be kicked out of placements. The last placement he was in, he walked away from and several miles to our house to tell our mother one of the workers pulled a knife on him. So my mom had started caring for him. This was about ten years ago.\n\nSo about once every couple years or longer, my brother would have a relapse where he would start obsessing over something odd, like the weather or Obama and it was difficult to understand exactly what his concern was. I would sit down with him and talk to him, but he was very hard to understand specifically when he was obsessing about something that upset him. After a few days or a week of this, eventually it would culminate in a large incident where the police would be called. I witnessed this happen when he banged his head on a vacuum and told the police someone else in the home had attacked him. This was NOT typical for his personality. He would go to the psychiatric hospital for a few days and come back perfectly normal and fine.\n\nAnother one of these incidents happened about a month ago where he started obsessing over something, making word soup, and he claimed to have thrown out his meds, which I guess weren't really his meds. However, the hospital sent him home without his clozapine and gave him depakote and abilify instead. For ages, my brother has insisted he doesn't have schizophrenia and said he'd been occasionally finding ways to not take his meds for a week at a time. He also claimed the hospital doesn't think he has schizophrenia and that is why they won't give him clozapine.\n\nSo for the past month, it has been a living hell. Relapses and the police arriving have gone from being a once in two years or longer event to happening at least four times in the past month. He attempted suicide twice and then has been downplaying that and everything else. He's been sleeping two hours at the most every single night. He hasn't been eating. He's been pounding on the walls and claiming he's not. He's been pacing the house. He's been making everyone anxious and on edge. Yelling and making accusations constantly. Constantly picking fights and telling me that another relative is out to get him, when I know that relative isn't. He's been telling me his contacts online who work for Google or the government are telling him this and that.\n\nThis has been out of control, and things are getting really scary. The hospital seemingly isn't taking this seriously and I have no idea what to do. I live a few states away, but my family is dealing with this every single day. What can they do?",

I\u2019ve always been a creative person, and my art has gotten me through some tough times. In the years since I turned 18, I\u2019ve been in and out of the psych ward every three months or so. I\u2019ve tried to kill myself multiple times. I get ECT but even that doesn\u2019t help much. Last December, however, I was in the hospital again and they started me on clozapine. I was released mid January and have been doing well since. Staying out of the hospital and such. But I\u2019ve completely lost my creativity. Art is something I love, and where I used to do a sketch or more a day, I can\u2019t even pick up my sketchbook now. And when I do finally want to draw, I just pick up my sketchbook and stare at it blankly. I\u2019m getting more and more frustrated with it, and I\u2019m started to feel hopeless. Are my only choices to be miserable but creative or happy and boring? What\u2019s the point of living if that\u2019s the case? I\u2019ve found myself getting lost in thought over it and it\u2019s led me to feel empty, hopeless, and lost. I\u2019m not who I am without my art, it\u2019s a big piece of my soul to have lost and everything feels pointless. Nothing in my life ever seems to work out the way it should.

        "title": "Conflict of interest and clinical research in psychiatry",
        "text": "Conflict of interest in psychiatry is the situation when a psychiatrist is unduly influenced by any circumstances that are secondary to his professional activity (to the well-being of his patients, to the development of science, and if he is a researcher, to the education of hist students if he is a teacher) [1]. This definition is present in the article of Mario May, a well-known psychiatrist, later - president of the World Psychiatric Association [2].\n\n**Contents**\n\n1. Varieties of conflict of interest in psychiatry\n2. Bias in conducting studies, publishing their results and analyzing\n3. Reasons and methods of forming a financial alliance\n4. Examples\n\n**Varieties of conflict of interest in psychiatry**\n\nA financial conflict of interest, according to M. May, is a conflict between interests related to the well-being of the patient or the development of science, and secondary interests associated with the desire to obtain financial benefits for themselves or their institution. The subject of financial conflict in authoritative sources was often considered, and mainly those types of this conflict that arise as a result of the interaction of psychiatrists with firms producing drugs. [1] \n \nM. May also mentions cases of the existence of a financial conflict of another kind: the sources of financial conflicts in these cases are not the relationship of psychiatrists with pharmaco-firms, but (again paid) their relationships with various public or private agencies: for example, a lawyer's office. M. May also points out the existence of non-financial conflicts of interest : the devotion of the researcher to the kind of treatment that he is engaged in, or, for example, the presence of an interest reflecting the political predilections of the psychiatrist. [1]\n\n**Bias in research, publication of their results and analysis**\n\nHighly authoritative sources on evidence-based standards in the treatment of depression and other mental disorders have identified problems such as:\n\n* an explicit and implicit influence of the legitimate interests of research sponsors on its results, leading to the fact that the results of Phase III studies are often questionable [3] \n* the constant tendency to publicize only positive results of research, hiding and concealing negative ones [4] [5][3] - works with positive results are twice as likely to be published (as a rule, in more prestigious and correspondingly more cited publications ); there is a tendency to repeatedly publish the same results, differently decorated [4];\n* use in meta-analyzes only the most favorable research results [4];\n* distortion of the essence of the data obtained using scientific papers [4];\n* original articles are often just a retelling of other sources, and only those publications that support certain conclusions are mentioned, so the list of sources in scientific reports often creates the wrong idea of \u200b\u200ba much larger number of studies than was actually done [4] .\n\n\nMario May notes: \n> In the past few years, I have seen clearly biased clinical guidelines and biased reviews and editorial articles; I know of several cases of publishing falsifications (that is, the publication of research reports, chapters of books or editorial articles signed by researchers but actually carried out by pharmaco-firms), and I have heard of several cases of selective attitude towards the publication of research results [1].\n\n\nAccording to statements made by government investigators and lawyers of plaintiffs (in lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies), many research articles about antipsychotics (neuroleptics) were considered in marketing departments of pharmaco companies, ghostwritten and then signed by well-known doctors - and this created the illusion that doctors carried out their research independently of each other (The New York Times, 2010). [6]\n\n**Reasons and methods of forming a financial alliance**\n\nAmerican doctor M. Angell notes that when some states enacted glasnost laws requiring that pharmaceutical companies report all payments to doctors, it turned out that psychiatrists receive more money from pharmaceutical companies than doctors of any other specialty. Approximately one fifth of the funding of the American Psychiatric Association comes from pharmaceutical companies. [7]\n\n\nAmong the reasons for this state of affairs, which M. Angell (and also D. Carlat, whose book \"The Mistaken\" is referred to by Angell), calls the following: [7]\nPsychiatry is a specialty that intensively uses medicines;\nthe subjectivity of diagnoses in psychiatry and the possibility of expanding diagnostic boundaries;\nAbsence of objective signs for mental diseases, laboratory data or findings on MRI , which allow correctly diagnose;\nThere are no rational reasons for preferring one medication to another.\n\n\nAs M. Angell writes, psychiatrists often receive attention and generous rewards from pharmaceutical companies, individually and collectively, directly and indirectly: gifts, free samples, fees for employment of psychiatrists as consultants and speakers, food for psychiatrists, payment for participation in conferences, and also supply with \"educational\" materials. The pharmaceutical industry sponsors meetings of the American Psychiatric Association and other psychiatric conferences. [7]\n\n\nIn 1998, in a letter to Rodrigo Munoza, president of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), Lauren Mosher, an American psychiatrist, expert on schizophrenia treatment, and founder of the Soteria project, said: At this point in history, in my view, psychiatry has been almost completely bought out by the drug companies. The APA could not continue without the pharmaceutical company support of meetings, symposia, workshops, journal advertising, grand rounds luncheons, unrestricted educational grants etc. etc. Psychiatrists have become the minions of drug company promotions. APA, of course, maintains that its independence and autonomy are not compromised in this enmeshed situation. Anyone with the least bit of common sense attending the annual meeting would observe how the drug company exhibits and \u201cindustry sponsored symposia\u201d draw crowds with their various enticements, while the serious scientific sessions are barely attended. Psychiatric training reflects their influence as well: the most important part of a resident\u2019s curriculum is the art and quasi-science of dealing drugs, i.e., prescription writing.\n\n\nLauren Mosher, Richard Gosden and Sharon Beder (English) note that at the meetings of the APA there are numerous exhibitions, events with food, drinks and various entertainments, such as musical performances, all financed by pharmaceutical companies. These authors also point out that the pharmaceutical companies provide support to almost all organizations involved in the field of psychiatric care [9].\n\n\nAccording to L. Mosher, R. Gosden and S. Beder, the most successful means of marketing pharmaceutical companies is probably direct personal contact of doctors and implementers of drugs (sales representatives). In addition, doctors are provided with carefully filtered information, advertising materials and samples of products produced by companies. Pharmaceutical companies also support research conducted at universities, and without this support, many departments of psychiatry, apparently, could not exist. With data from clinical trials funded by the same companies, the pharmaceutical companies decide which of these information should be published, selects authors, writes for them, and reviews these articles in order to present the information in the most beneficial form [9].\n\n\nFor the implementation of counter-criticism, as noted by L. Mosher, R. Gosden and S. Beder, prominent representatives of academic circles and scientists are hired, who are more difficult to suspect of bias than workers of pharmaceutical companies. Authors who criticize the activities of pharmaceutical companies are discredited and persecuted by their colleagues, who receive some compensation from companies for this or that measure. The financing of publications that publish materials that are unprofitable for pharmaceutical companies is being stopped. There have been cases of suing the investigators who published negative reviews of the results of clinical trials paid by these companies [9].\n\n\nDirector of the Law, Ethics and Psychiatry Section at Columbia University Paul Appelbaum (English), former head of the American Psychiatric Association, said at an annual meeting of APA that by the third year of medical schooling, 94% of future psychiatrists became holders of \"small, unrelated gifts or received invitations to dinner\" from pharmaceutical companies [10].\n\n\n**Examples**\n \nIn many meta-analytical surveys, mention is made of the possibility of distortion of information in studies in favor of atypical antipsychotics. S. Ahmer, P. Arya analyzed the dependence of the outcome of RCTs on the study of the effectiveness of antipsychotics from funding sources and found that in studies funded by pharmaceutical companies, the results were more reliably obtained in favor of the new drug. It is also characteristic to silence the negative results of the action of atypical antipsychotics.\n \nIn 2006, an article was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, whose authors (S. Heres, J. Davis, K. Maino, E. Jetzinger, etc.) analyzed 42 publications on randomized controlled trials comparing atypical antipsychotics aripiprazole, amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole and ziprasidone. 32 of these 43 trials were fully or partially funded by pharmaceutical companies. The study revealed a correlation between sponsorship support and the findings outlined in the abstracts of publications; in 90% of cases in publications the conclusion was made about the superiority of the drug, produced by the testing company, over other drugs. As a result, different comparisons of the same antipsychotic drugs led to contradictory conclusions, depending on the sponsorship of the studies. As the authors noted, the results of the tests could be influenced by differences in dosages of drugs and increasing doses, the criteria for including patients in trials and other features of clinical trials leading to biased results [13].\n \nIn the same year, an article was published in Psychological Medicine, whose authors (RE Kelly, LJ Cohen, RJ Semple, P. Bialer, and others) reviewed the clinical trials of all drugs used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders published in four peer-reviewed psychiatric journals from 1992 to 2002 (542 of which totaled 542), found that the percentage of research sponsored by pharmaceutical companies increased from 25% in 1992 to 57% in 2002. It also turned out that positive results were much more frequent in studies sponsored by the manufacturers of the drugs being tested than in studies that were not financed by pharmaceutical companies or financed by competitors of pharmaceutical companies that produce the drugs under study. In studies sponsored by manufacturers of test drugs, positive results were obtained in 78% of cases, in studies that were not funded by pharmaceutical companies - in 48%, and in financed by competitors - in 28% of cases [14].\n \nAnother example is B. Vastag, a reporter for The Washington Post, in his blog on the newspaper's website. In order to receive approval for the use of eight atypical antipsychotics , 24 studies were conducted - but four of these studies were not published in professional journals, and all four were not in favor of the drugs. Three of the unpublished studies showed that new drugs do not work better than placebo ; two of these three concerned abiliphia (aripiprazole), and one - geodona (ziprasidona) [15].\n \nIn 2008, the British newspaper The Independent reported that Harvard University (USA) was at the center of a scientific and political scandal after three well-known employees of the Department of Psychiatry were convicted of violating the law on the conflict of interest without having declared millions of dollars, received from pharmaceutical companies as fees for consultations. So, the world-famous children's psychiatrist Joseph Biderman, whose merit is a sharp increase in the use of potent neuroleptics, did not deem it necessary to inform the university management of at least 1.6 million US dollars received from the manufacturers of these drugs; two of his colleagues also did not disclose their fees of $1.6 million and $1 million. \n \nThe relationship between Harvard scientists and pharmaco companies is a long-standing topic of debate, as their studies gave impetus to the previously banned use of antipsychotics in pediatrics [16].\n \nIn particular, as reported by The New York Times, J. Biderman's research on the prevalence of bipolar affective disorder in children led to an increase in the diagnosis of this disease in childhood. Johnson & Johnson paid more than $ 700,000 to the research center headed by Dr. Biderman from 2002 to 2005 , and some of his work advertises the neuroleptic risperidone (risperdal), which is manufactured by this company [6].\n \nIn 1999, as noted by The Washington Post, AstraZeneca, the manufacturer of neuroleptic seroquel (quetiapine), presented data at a conference of the American Psychiatric Association and at a psychiatric conference in Europe; in the conclusion of these reports it was stated that quetiapine helps patients suffering from psychosis to lose weight.\n \nThis conclusion is made on the basis of a sponsored AstraZeneca study conducted by a Chicago psychiatrist who has studied reports on 65 patients transferred to seroquel. Nevertheless, the documents show that AstraZeneca did not fully trust the methods of this psychiatrist and treated him without deep respect. In 1997, according to the results of the study, which was called \"Study 15\", it became known that quetiapine causes a clinically dangerous weight gain, but the data of this study were hidden by the company. Details of the Study 15 were found in trials that suggest that seroquel was the cause of weight gain, development of hyperglycemia and diabetes in thousands of patients who took it [17].\n \nAgainst Eli Lilly and Company, a pharmaceutical company manufacturing neuroleptic ziprexa (olanzapine), lawsuits were filed in connection with the advertising of the drug for its misuse and in connection with the concealment of certain side effects (hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus) [18]. Knowing the risk of weight gain in patients, the company nevertheless minimized the link between ziprex and obesity in the widely circulated video \"Myth of Diabetes\", which used the results of studies of questionable quality and honesty and false reporting of side effects [19].\n \nThe company paid more than a billion dollars to settle lawsuits on ziprexa [18]. British psychiatrist, professor of psychological medicine at the University of Cardiff David Healy mentioned the carefully hidden research data on the use of ziprex, according to which this drug has the highest suicide rate in the history of clinical trials [10].\n \nReporting on his unsuccessful attempts to publish silenced data on clinical trials in journals that refused to publish it, David Healy noted that, according to these data, the risk of suicide in taking antidepressants is much higher than previously indicated in open sources [10].\n \nIn a commentary to the report of the CINP Working Group (Collegium Internationale NeuroPsychopharmacologicum), \"Therapy with antidepressants and other methods of treating depressive disorders,\" D. Healy wrote: \n>The report endorses the position that a relatively modest advantage over placebo in the selected number of clinical studies means that antidepressants work. <...> Studies always select; a large number of studies demonstrating only a minor or even lack of antidepressant benefits over placebo have been published and, accordingly, declared for certain indications. <...> ... The approach seems to be false, when out of 10 patients take 5 responding to these antidepressants and compare with 4 responding to placebo, assessing the advantage according to the rating scale, and conclude that the drug works. When a 50% response to antidepressants is compared against a 40% response to a placebo, do not take into account that the response to an antidepressant in 80% of cases depends on nonspecific factors. We are not able to quantify the contribution of various nonspecific factors, while we readily quantify the specific effects of drugs. Meanwhile, it reflects only 20% of the specific answer. And for someone, the money and culture that has developed in psychiatry can serve as the basis for a demonstrative judgment in favor of 80%, not 20% success [3].\n \nDavid Healy also points out that antidepressants can be approved for use by drug regulators, even if only 2 trials out of 100 showed the effectiveness of a particular drug. In large trials, even a small difference between the main group and the placebo group can be statistically significant [20].\n \nPeter G\u00f6tsche, co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration, professor of design and analysis of clinical research at the University of Copenhagen, author of more than 70 articles in leading medical journals such as the British Medical Journal and The Lancet, questions the quality of clinical trials of the effectiveness of antidepressants.\n \nHe notes that in a number of studies, placebo was different from the active drug in terms of physical characteristics, such as texture, color and thickness; that placebo in the vast majority of studies on the action of antidepressants had no side effects (eg, dry mouth), with the exception of the rare cases when atropine was used as a placebo, and because of the absence of side effects, patients in the studies could suspect that they were not taking the medicine but placebo.\n \nAccording to G\u00f6tsche's conclusions, the true difference in improvement with antidepressants and placebo seems to be significantly less than the 10 percent reported in official research results, as there is evidence that a double-blind study in which blinding is inadequate can lead to a very significant exaggeration of the effectiveness of drugs [19].\n \nG\u00f6tzsche also mentions that bias in the prozac-sponsored trials of prozac (fluoxetine) is very high: in direct comparative trials, where this drug was the main subject of the study, a significantly larger number of patients became better off from it than in trials in which Prozac was a comparator that is, it was used for comparison) [19].\n \nIrving Kirsch (English), a well-known American psychologist, having analyzed a number of clinical studies of antidepressants (including those of them whose data were not printed, because they received undesirable results), found that the results of most studies are negative.\n \nThe median difference between the drugs and the placebo was only 1.8 on the Hamilton scale (widely used for assessing the symptoms of depression), although the difference was significant statistically, but clinically meaningless. However, since studies with positive results have been widely published, and studies with negative results have been hiding, the public and medical professionals have come to believe that these drugs are highly effective antidepressants [21].\n \nIn 2008, an analysis (Turner and co-authors) of both published and unpublished studies on the effects of 12 antidepressants was conducted; data from these studies were provided to the authors of the analysis by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was found that 94% of previously published trials showed an antidepressant benefit compared with placebo; However, after reviewing the results of both published and unpublished trials, Turner and co-authors found that only about 51% of them show an advantage compared to placebo. Of the 74 studies reviewed, only 38 had positive results, and almost all of them were published. Studies with negative or questionable results were mostly unpublished (22 studies), or published with distortion of results, as a result of which they appeared as positive (11 studies) [22].\n \nStatistics specialist Hans Melander and his colleagues from the Swedish Medicines Agency in 2003 showed that published articles on trials of SSRI antidepressants contain significant distortions compared to data on studies provided in registration applications sent to the agency. In all 42 studies that were submitted to the agency, except for one, the company performed both an intentional analysis and an analysis according to the protocol (which does not include patients who dropped out of the study). \n \nHowever, in only two publications of the results of the studies, both analyzes were present, but in the remaining cases only a more favorable analysis was provided - analysis according to the protocol. This created a false impression on the readers about the effectiveness of the drugs. In addition, individual tests were sometimes published as if they were the same test, there were no cross-references to numerous publications of the same trial; sometimes there were no surnames of authors, common to all publications [19].\n \nA systematic review of 29 published and 11 unpublished clinical trials (authors of the review - C. Barbui, T. Furukawa, A. Cipriani, 2008) showed that one of the most popular and often prescribed antidepressants - paroxetine does not exceed placebo in terms of overall efficacy and tolerability of treatment. These results were not distorted by selective selection of published studies [23].\n \nIn connection with the increased risk of suicide against the background of taking paroxetine, several dozens of lawsuits were filed against the manufacturer of this drug GlaxoSmithKline.\n \nThe lawyers of the affected parties managed to gain access to the internal documentation of the company and to draw as a result of its study the conclusion that GlaxoSmithKline as early as 1989 had information about an eightfold increase in the risk of suicide when taking its drugs [24].\n \nIn general, the risk of suicide and suicidal tendencies in the use of SSRIs is much higher than reported by pharmaceutical companies. So, at least three companies: GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly and Company and Pfizer - added suicide and suicide attempts to the placebo group in clinical trials if they occurred before patients were randomized into groups. \n \nIn addition, cases of suicidal thoughts and actions in the results of clinical trials are often referred to as \"emotional lability\". Often, events related to suicidal intentions caused by the drug were not recorded if they occurred shortly after the withdrawal of SSRIs; Finally, data on many studies that showed undesirable results were completely hidden [19].\n \nAccording to M. May, the unpleasant tendencies that he notes in the study of bipolar disorders are biased in favor of new drugs compared with traditional ones (mainly lithium): in some studies, the level of lithium in the blood was too low, and therefore it is not surprising that these patients had worse treatment outcomes than those who received new psychotropic drugs; several clinical trial reports focused on the secondary properties of the drugs (eg, no side effects), resulting in studies that were evaluated as positive, although the primary effect of the drug was not different from placebo [1].\n \nM. May also mentions that The Lancet publicized one of the cases of a financial conflict of the opposite kind: it turned out that the author of the articl\u0443 which found a link between vaccination against measles and rubella and several cases of autism, had financial ties with a law firm that A lawsuit in favor of children allegedly affected by vaccination [1].\n \n**References**\n\n1.

My Father, the recluse, ventured out, and sat with us a few hours so that we could take advantage of his pool. \n\nHaving been years since we took a photo together, I coerced him into a photo shoot with me.\n\nI went to view them, and my heart sank. I thought to myself \"I can't post these, my Dad looks horrible.\" I immediately felt terrible for thinking that, but still decided I wasn't going to post them.\n\nI woke up this morning, and thought \"Fuck that, I'm gonna post them.\"\n\nHere's why....\n\nThis is my Dad, and this is real life.\n\nThis is what 35yrs of mental illness looks like. This is 35yrs of life with Paranoid Schizophrenia. This is 35yrs of thorazine, haldal and clozapine...35yrs of antipsychotics. This is 35yrs of body contortions, and sleep terrors...35yrs of trial&error. This is 35yrs of self medicating with meth and heroin..35yrs of running from demons. This is 35yrs of broken promises, and crushed dreams...35yrs of tears. This is 35yrs of anger and embarrassment. This is 35yrs of social workers, and case managers. This is 35yrs of fearing the unknown...and 35yrs of \"fuck not again.\" This is 35yrs of wishing for \"normal.\"\n\nThis is 35yrs of fucking hard.\n\nThis is also 35yrs of fight.\n\nThis is 35yrs of of embracing the hand dealt, and learning to live with the dealer. This is 35yrs of family struggle and advocating. This is 35yrs of pushing, and praying. This is 35yrs of encouragement, and hand-holding. This is 35yrs of grasping for hope..35yrs of never giving up.\n\nThis is also 35yrs of love, and loyalty, and finding forgiveness, and patience, and sometimes no patience, and hanging on, and crossing fingers, and throwing shit, and thanking God, and being brave, and breaking down, and wanting so fucking bad, to do more than exist. This is 35yrs of learning acceptance.\n\nBecause as much as I'd like to walk away some days...this is life.\n\nHis life. My life. Our life.\n\nAnd one thing I will never be, is ashamed.\n\nBecause we have fought.\n\n#mentalhealthawareness\n#mylifewithaparanoidschizophrenic\n#thisisreallife\n#neverbeashamedofyourstory",

        "text": "My psychiatrist keeps talking about putting me on clozapine because other antipsychotics don\u2019t fully control my symptoms. I had a psychotic episode and had to go to the hospital even though I was taking my meds and clozapine was discussed while I was there too. If I did go on clozapine I would probably only need a low dose but I\u2019m scared of the side effects. The thought of bowel obstruction in particular is horrifying.\n\nI still deal with hallucinations and paranoia even though I\u2019m on the max dose of geodon and I also struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts. Other antipsychotics either didn\u2019t work or had intolerable side effects. So I understand that I\u2019m an ideal candidate for clozapine. I know some people consider it to be life changing but I\u2019m scared it\u2019ll just be a bad experience. I\u2019m also a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer which makes me nervous about it.",

I am under treatment and doing well and I don't write the following out of paranoia, more out of skepsis and because I have questions regarding my mothers diagnosis.   \n  \nFor more than a decade I am used to the mental illness of my mother, as far as the whole family knows, she suffers a lot from depression. I recently even asked her if she is sure that she was diagnosed with depression and nothing else, first, because my own illness could possibly stem from it, but moreover, I was asking her because I am concerned that the psychiatrist she is visiting for years now, is an absolute jerk, no, even a criminal.\n\nTBH, there is no real question whether he is a jerk or not, I experienced him live, I had to meet him 2 times by myself and immediately switched the doc. And also the outstanding bad google recensions are evidence enough. He seems to be at least an arrogant, choleric, egocentric person, maybe quite narcisstic. There are many examples I could list, one was my own experience. While in psychosis I had to meet him, I was pretty paranoid and didn't want to be put away into the hospital. So I kindly refused, but he became totally angry and said something like: \"You are ruining my date with my wife! We planned to go for dinner and now I have to sit here for longer\". He was so pissed of by me, although I didn't even had the chance to start to explain what I was experiencing. just one example. He also treats other patients like shit, calling depressive people lazy, laughing about people of a different culture and so on... my mother is only there because she has a good heart and is not the smartest, she doesn't know how to protect herself from authoritarian asshole personalities, which this psychatrist is. You can't argue with this guy because he will immediately rage and force you out of his office.\n\nSo now, my question:   \n**Is it normal for a woman with depression to get treatment with clozapine?**   \nAs far as I know, clozapine is mostly used for schizophrenia and only if other medications didn't help, but my mom got this treatment pretty early by him.   \nAlso she had to undergo ECT when I was young. \n\nI don't get how a person with depression gets a clozapine treatment.  \nI trust my mother that she isn't aware of any other diagnosis than depression,  \nso all my doubts go towards this shady psychatrist who will soon retire.\n\nAgain, I hope you won't be biased, if you don't trust me that this man is an asshole, I can give you more examples.

And I realised this in my 4 days off. Saying that, I haven't been sleeping and I have racing thoughts and now the walls sparkle so I definitely dont recommend 4 days off meds. Got meds today",

I cant relax, chill or feel at ease at all, i grt terrified of everything when i shohldnt be (im at a hospital ward).  The doctor says that my symptoms are coming back as part of the proceudure, and that the second injection should help with that. \n\nI spoke to my Doctor and i asked to be put on the alternative which is Clozapine, at first i wasnt sure about having my blood drawn each week, but i would take that over the hell ive had from the first paliperidone injection.. i cannot bear that for four weeks. \n\nBut at the same time im not sure if i should give paliperidone more time (i have heard that its not the most favoured antipsychotic around which made me think, i dont want to be feeling like this so i might as well try out clozapine next as ive heard good things). \n\nAny advice on clozapine?

The psyche floor doc, is our psychiatrist. has been for over 10 years. So we all know each other. \n\nPoly drug therapy was working for loved one. Well enough, pdoc thought to ween off one of the aps (risperidone). That's when things went downhill quick. After a few weeks on only the single ap (caplyta) she went catatonic. Resulting in a ambulance ride and a multi week stint on psyche floor.\n\npdoc prescribed clozapine/clozaril. 400s + low dose risperidone. She 's still shaky, but is out of hospital andrecovering.\n\nat follow up appt, I asked pdoc if the cloza was long or short term. he says long term. I mention i am concerned about long term side effects, he accuses me of arguing with him and says maybe we should find a new doc.  out of character for him. i think hes mad loved on refused to do the inoffice IOP. either way, he settled a bit after i told him there was no argument.\n\nsaid cloza is only option since no others have worked. when told that loved one did fine (high functiong, drive, do bills, shop, handle appts) on the poly drug combo, he insisted that wasn't the case. even though we go see pdoc every 3 mos. at *minimum*. His records would only take a minute to look at to see there was a period of time where loved one was doing well. \n\nit's especially frustrating since we've been seeing pdoc for a long time. plus, she just got discharged. How could he not know that the  caplyta+risperidone combo was effective for so long?\n\nend rant.\n\n1) What is the general consensus on clozaril? It's got some scary side effects. Loved one will try for a few weeks until next appointment. \n\n2) Has anyone had success switching form clozaril to a different ap? thinking about trying the caplyta+risperidone combo again after the weeks of clozaril.\n\n3) how does one find a new pdoc? get 3months of meds from current doc and \"interview\" a few? I'd hate to do the whole new patient intake and then not like the new doc. only to have to switch again. \n\nany an d all info is much appreciated!!!!!!!!!",

What have your experiences been like with both pre-clozapine disorganization and post-clozapine disorganization?\n\nOn a similar note, if there *are* people who fit this category of pure hebephrenic benefiters from clozapine (which I assume there are, possibly just more rarely occurring), I'm curious as to why we don't see more off-label usage of clozapine for severe forms of ADHD involving disorganization.  This ties back to what dictates a severe enough level of disorganization in thought and/or speech as to dictate usage of an antipsychotic, or if the usage of the antipsychotic is indicated when there is dopamine supersensitivity in the striatum making stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamines, etc) problematic to use as they can then *bring out* previously latent \"positive symptoms\" like proper hallucinatory voices and so on. Which then further reinforces the \"subtypes of schizophrenia\" model where there could be some people who are virtually indistinguishable from people with ADHD in terms of their speech and even thought patterns, but have some \"dopamine supersensitivity\" proneness giving them the diagnosis of schizophrenia, and for whom treatments may uniquely need to be devised.\n\n^(1). I'm using scare quotes because disorganization is itself a multi-faceted in cause and level of pathological implication, sort of concept. See this articulately worded description by another user on this subreddit here in a comment on this post: [(1) Would this count as \"disorganized speech\"? (and looking for other examples) : schizophrenia (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/wnqgjm/would_this_count_as_disorganized_speech_and/)\n\n\"It could be due to a kind of ADHD-like distractibility coupled with a high energy, it could be due to poor verbal working memory, such that you can't maintain a train of though, or it could be due to loose associations, such that others can't follow what seems to you to be a reasonable concatenation.\"",

However, it's been difficult seeing him grow sadder and sadder from the combination of depression and schizophrenia, and I've been trying to find ways to keep him going and helping him however I can.\n\nOne of the things that recently have affected him is his meds no longer working as well, so I thought I'd at least research and ask around for any suggestions on what to do, to give him an idea on what to ask or request from his psychologist.\n\nHe's been using Clozapine for his whole life- since his youth -and only recently has it started not working. I know it's a really good medicine from what I hear, but I want to know if there may be any reason for it no longer working as well as it did for almost two decades.",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nAs the subject suggests, I have a 46-year-old sister with schizophrenia, paranoid presentation. Clozapine is the only drug that alleviates psychosis and she is on 600 mg I believe - the highest dose. her thoughts have gotten worse in the past year, likely due to estrogen drops. Right now, she is a UCLA-directed psych unit in Los Angeles County.\n\nShe now has intrusive, OCD-like thoughts (though they could be voices! we are not sure), about doing violent things to my mother. My sister is the sweetest, calmest person. She has no violent history or mood troubles or anger. It's more that these random thoughts pop up in her head, and it deeply agitates her, so it's obsessive concerns for causing harm, and the doctor's are adjusting meds. Docs aren't sure just yet if it's OCD or a form of psychosis. She is taking steps to protect herself and others though - it was her decision and her idea to go to the psych unit. \n\nI'm frustrated. I don't understand *why none of her psychiatrists have taken any preemptive action before this massive hormonal adjustment.* I'm angry. When she came down with SZ, the doc told my mother it would \"get better with age.\" That only applies to men. For women, schizophrenia can appear for the first time at mid-life!\n\nI'm angry that reproductive psychiatry pretty much focuses its research on pregnant women, not menopausal women, as though older women literally do not matter at all to society. Or that women's utility is bound up in child-bearing.\n\nAnyhow, thanks for letting me rant.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience navigating this? Any women who relate?\n\nI myself have bipolar and ADHD and am taking estrogen and it greatly helps but I'm not on a hardcore drug like Clozapine!\n\nAll the other antipsychotics failed to take her psychosis away.\n\nThanks for any help!",

I remember the terror I used feel and I can compare it to how I feel now. The conclusion is in the title : I am not terrified anymore. My delusions are gone, the voices in my head as well. I feel so much better.\n\nI used to feel terrified everyday from waking up to falling asleep and it drove me to major depression. Everyday was worse than the previous one. I was drowning in hallucinations and was thinking obsessively about delusions. I knew that things were only getting worse but I kept fighting. I'm impressed that I had the courage to go outside, to keep going to Uni, to try to talk to people. I did my best to heal but nothing worked. I tried to meet people, to focus on work, to take time to rest, to exercise, to go outside, to start a new hobby... I tried everything that was accessible to me. I was extremely strict with my self. I became obsessed with change : I was feeling badly so I HAD to change something. Nothing worked...\n\nThen I started asking for help.\n\nI first tried to cure my depression but it was not as effective as I thought it would be, there was something else that went undiagnosed when I went to a mental health institution for my depression. A few months after going out, I ended up in the ER for hallucinations, delusions, and suicidal thoughts. 2 months later, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. It helped me thinking critically of my delusions and medication greatly reduce hallucinations.\n\nI still suffer from anxiety but things are getting better and will continue getting better.\n\nI'm not terrified anymore and I smile again.",

I felt like I was about to collapse, I lost the ability to walk properly and had extreme difficulty breathing, I was helped into the car by my parents for them to drive me home. At this point I was unresponsive, zonked out and was experiencing a state of coma and unconsciousness. I remember believing that this is the moment my life ends, I was even so immobilized that I didn't even have the capability to somehow manage to open the door and roll out in an attempt to speed up the process, as I was feeling that I may as well speed up the process to end the pain I was enduring. I felt as if I was paralyzed and there was nothing I could do, I also lost the ability to speak so I wasn't able to let my parents know how I was feeling. They must have assumed that everything was some what normal and that I was just having a very deep sleep after being off my meds for the 6 days during which I was acting very strange and not sleeping much at all. As well as the fact that we had a certain level of trust with the prescribing doctor up till this incident.\n\nI lodged a complaint to the relevant place here in Australia about what happened and their outcome of the assessment was, that the clinical care that I received from the prescribing doctor not raise any issues of a clinical nature that would require further action, As well as referencing to the large dose as a loading dose.\n\nBefore I lodged my complaint I contacted every Lawyer in my town about suing for medical negligence, as there was no long term damage they weren't interested. Very annoying as I was so close to having extreme long term damage or even death. Plus it is the principal of what he prescribed me to take.\n\nIf the result of my review is non satisfactory again, I will contact the Lawyers again to talk about suing the Government and the organization that is meant to handle complaints.\n\nI am actively preparing for a review against there findings.\n\nCheers",

        "text": "Hello, it\u2019s nice to join this subreddit and find a community. I go by Titan online and I\u2019ve had schizophrenia for as long as I can remember with bipolar developing when I was a teenager. I started seeking treatment when I turned 18, and have been trying different medications for the past four years. \n\nNothing has been very helpful with my hallucinations. Olanzapine was the most helpful for a couple months before it felt like things got worse. Recently my psychiatrist has told me that he would like to put me on Clozapine. The FIRST THING he told me about the medication is that it could potentially kill me in two weeks. He said I needed weekly bloodwork and appointments for 6 months before they are spaced out every two weeks for 6 months and then once a month for 6 months. He also told me the pharmacy would not give me my medication without these bloodwork and appointments. \n\nThe thing is, even though I have heard countless people tell me it\u2019s life changing and could work when nothing else does, I have SO MUCH trouble going to my current monthly appointments with my psychiatrist. I leave the house once a month to see him and pick up my medication. I couldn\u2019t possibly imagine leaving the house /three times a week/ for this. \n\nI know no one could give me medical advice or tell me whether this would be worth it for me personally. But for people who have taken clozapine, was it worth it for you? How well did it work for positive symptoms? Did it help with anxiety at all?\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you so much. Any words of encouragement would be help! \ud83d\udc95",

        "text": "I have been on various subreddits the past week complaining about my anti-psychotics, basically i was court ordered to take Clozapine 5 months ago because of a severe schizophrenic episode. Before this i was happily prescribed to Chlorpromazine and managed with it, but this Clozapine is fucking with me badly and my doctor refuses to switch pills or reduce the dosage.\n\nMy friend suggested to stop taking them and assured me DMT or Ayahuasca was a miracle drug for schizophrenia so iv been asking drug subreddits all i can about psychedelics and schizophrenia and people say to never take it because i could be in a permanent psycosis episode which if its bullshit or not is too scary to try.\n\nSo i'm stuck. I'm going to go cold turkey off the pills and therapy and psychiatrists, I have only had 2 non paranoid schizophrenic episodes and a handful of delusions in that last 5 months iv been forced to take Clozapine so i don't think i will have a bad paranoid episode now that i have stopped taking it.\n\nI have been thinking about what if i do and have decided to kill myself if i fuck up again. If i fuck up 5 months drugged on Clozapine then ill never be better so what would the point be. I have only attempted once before but botched. sliced my self from left to right later learning it should of been up to down on the vain and it left me in a bloody mess for 5 hours tingling and throbbing. Cant even kill myself right. So i will try and hang myself if it does come to it.\n\nI couldn't talk to anyone the past few days because everyone around me in the real world knows to put me under watch or in a facility if i ever talk about suicide or coming off my pills. And starting from today I'm not going to be physically around anybody for the first 2 weeks to see how my mind copes.\n\nI'm fucking the therapy and the psychiatrists off but have to still see my doctor as it is court ordered. I am going to pretend everything is normal unless my body or mind is hurting then i might have to rethink all of this.\n\nI know what i am doing is morally wrong but Id rather die then spending any more time on that drug. Sorry for the rant, I'm pretty scared at the minute and cannot talk to anyone about this",

        "text": "Hi guys hope you are all doing well..so this is a bit of a rant and a bit of me asking for some advice!\n\nTLDR - Psych wants me on clozapine even though I'm not currently experiencing symptoms.\n\nI have a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder and have been on around  5 or 6 different antipsychotics over the last 3 years. The last medication I was on was zuclopenthixol (clopixol) injected into my buttock every two weeks. At first it brought me out of psychosis and really helped to stablise me and give me the rest my body needed but after 3 4 months on it I began to experience really really bad side effects. Due to the nature of my illness I only really get severly psycotic around March/April time and my thought process was that why am I taking antipsychotics all year round if I only get really sick for a few months of the year?! Made a long and hard decision to come off antipsychotics and try and live my life as fulfillingly as I can without them. \n\nFast forward 2 months and I am not really experiencing any psycotic symptoms except from the odd voices here and there when i get really stressed.\n\nHad an appointment with my consultant Psyciatrist yesterday and he insisted that my symptoms won't come back for 3-6 months as the injection binds to your fat and stays in your system for that long. OK this I understand but he then went on to say that he really thinks I should be on an antipsychotic and that i will relapse hard when symptoms come back. He then said that my schizophrenia side of the SZA is treatment resistant because I've been on a few antipsychotics and still ended up hospitalised on them despite being on the highest dose.I don't agree with this as I have found antipsychotics bring me out of psychosis pretty fast in the past.\n\nWe discussed medication for a while and seroquel is the only medication that I found bearable to be on despite the huge weight gain but I ended up severley ill and hospitalised on 950mg so he said it wasn't working for me. \n\nHe said he thinks I should be on an injection because it seemed to stabilise me the most and is easy as I only have to come in every few weeks to have it done. He told me that they have a medication that is very effective and has little side effects. I actually felt a glimmer of hope until he said the medication was called clozapine (clozaril). \n\nI have seen patients that are on clozapine and they are for the most part extremely unhealthy and overweight and they talk very slowly and incoherently from what I've seen. I also know that you have to have regular blood tests done. This medication is a last resort for most people as it is SERIOUS stuff. \n\nI feel very hurt to be honest that my Psyciatrist that I used to trust wants to put me on such heavy medication despite not really having any current psycotic symptoms. I feel like he wants me to just take this horrible medication and shut up and not be a problem anymore for him. This has really broken my trust I had for him as I don't see why he says I'm treatment resistant or why he's offering me such a strong life debilitating medication in such a nonchalant casual way. He knows I havent worked in 3 4 years and as a 26 y old man all I want to do is go back to work and it feels like he's trying to chemically lobotomise me.\n\nRant over its 5am and im writing essays \ud83d\ude01\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb.",

Risperidone toned down my symptoms but they are not completely gone so my psychiatrist advised me to try something else. I had to choose between amizulpride and clozapine. I chose clozapine because it is the strongest AP available.\n\nI'm now on 2mg risperidone and 12.5mg clozapine and my symptoms are getting stronger. I'm not delusional at all but I'm experiencing severe anxiety and hallucinations. Clozapine is supposed to help me sleep but it doesn't. I can't focus on anything because of my hallucinations. I hear voices in my head, much louder than my own thoughts.\n\nI can't read, I can't study, I can barely watch movies and write because my attention span is terrible. I just want it to end but I have to be patient.\n\nDo you guys have any advice for me ? My symptoms are very strong but my insight is good, I just need to pass the time. Don't hesitate to tell me about your experience with clozapine ! Sedation, hunger, symptoms, sleep...etc.",

I\u2019ve been doing really well on clozapine at 150, no insomnia in 21+ months, work part time and read and go to the gym daily. Im hoping not to go psychotic after reducing it.",

        "text": "I started taking clozapine in January 2019. I had to go to my psychiatrists office and they checked my blood pressure and some other things, gave me a pill, took some more tests and blood work and then another pill and continued monitoring me for about four hours. Shortly after takking the pills I told my psychiatrist \"I haven't felt like this in a long time.\" There was a feeling of Serenity and being Ok with how I was. I was getting blood work weekly and was tapered up to 500mg. I began getting constipated and drooling about a gallon on my pillow every night. I was given docusate(stool softener) and miralax for the constipation and atropine eye drops to put under my tongue before sleep to help with the drooling. I used the eye drops for a couple months, but then discontinued due to the eye drops completely drying out my mouth. I was taking the 500mg every night either at 8pm 9pm or 10pm. Around thirty minutes afterwards i got the munchies and after forty five minutes in if I tried to walk I had to use the walls to keep me up. This is also the time where heavy heavy sedation kicked in. Every night I slept a minimum of twelve hours or more. I spent my days in bed or on the couch and the only thing I got up for was cigarettes and dinner. The sedation was a lot everyday.\n\n\n\n\u00a0About four or five months in I began throwing up almost everyday and multiple times. Got a couple endoscopies done and a colonoscopy, neither of which showed anything, but we found that Protonix helped that. Throwing up almost everyday for almost a year was terrible.\u00a0\n\n\nAround nine months in we began to taper down the clozapine 50mg every month until we got to 300mg. Was still sleeping twelve or more hours and being in bed for eighteen or more hours.\u00a0\n\n\nRecently in the past three or four months I've been taking 100mg in the morning, 100mg in the afternoon, and 100mg at night with my psychiatrists approval. This has helped Immensely. No more Heavy sedation, no more sleeping twelve plus hours,\u00a0I'm much more active, and feeling better. My body is really weak from being in bed those eighteen or more hours for over a year. So this gives me something else to work on.",

Just a 40% improvement in symptoms, and nothing more than that. \n\nThe doctor has mentioned that we only have Clozapine and another tablet (can't remember the name). He mentioned that we need to get some blood work done which has gotten me worried. \n\nAt the same time, despite taking 11 tablets a day, there's really no major change in symptoms (which is bad), and next to no side effects either (which is nice). So we really are at a crossroads here on what to do next. \n\nCan you pls suggest next steps based on your experience? Is Clozapine the right move? We are looking at increasing Risperidone from 10mg to 12mg and seeing for another 3 weeks, and then making a decision on Clozapine. \n\nHoping to learn from your experience and then making a decision.",

I live in Australia and am hoping to travel overseas to the UK and Europe for about two months next year, if I can save up enough money.

Side effects should be discussed at each visit. Generally to prevent bowel obstruction it\u2019s common to start a laxative like Miralax daily. Of course, discuss that with your psychiatrist. You should be watching out for constipation on this med and report it to your psychiatrist if it occurs. \n\nYou also get weekly bloodwork when starting this med and may get one or more EKGs (a test of your heart\u2019s rhythm and a screen for some heart issues).",

I was wondering about my options for when traditional Clozapine augmentations fail.\n\nIf my tx refractory psychotic patient fails an adequate trial of clozapine, I generally try to augment with a potent D2 blocker (for example, Haloperidol 5mg qHS or Risperidone 2mg BID), or a partial agonist (for example Aripiprazole 20mg qAM or Cariprazine 3mg qHS). If both of these fail then generally I try one of the traditional mood stabilizers (for Lithium Carbonate and Divalproex Sodium I get to acceptable plasma concentrations, for Lamotrigine I generally titrate to 200mg.)\n\nI don't have too many patients end up failing all of these augmentations, but I am curious what I could do for those select few. ECT is an option I suppose, although my experience with ECT has been frustrating to say the least because of pushback from insurance. Another option would be to titrate off the Clozapine and try high dose Olanzapine, I've tried 30mg to 40mg and have not seen much success.\n\nIs there anything else I could do for these patients? Any and all advice is very much appreciated.",

        "text": "So, I am working presently as a supervising provider at a major regional adult inpatient psychiatric hospital. I\u2019ve recently been frustrated with my decision making regarding our patients with Schizoaffective or Schizophrenia and their response to treatment.\n\nOften, these patients come in after coming off their medications, or when their medications have stopped working. I\u2019ll put them back on their old regimen, or trial a new one. I do my best to optimize their regimen, identifying a therapeutic dose with serum level monitoring. Some patients improve drastically, others just somewhat. Some are good candidates for Clozapine, others not so much (will refuse the blood draws or unlikely to tolerate the side effects). I start that whenever I can.\n\nWhat I have wanted to ask here is how do others in this role decide when a response is \u201cenough\u201d? So many patients have residual symptoms that are quite burdensome, and yet I know with each medication change, our odds of an improved response are increasingly diminished, and I have to weigh whether it is worth the time and utilization of resources to trial a new medication (or combination) despite knowing the odds are against us. Of course, this is to some degree the nature of the illness. But I never want to be leaving anything on the table. Some patients are clearly so unwell, involuntary Clozapine or even ECT is needed, and I have no qualms pursuing those things. But it\u2019s when patients are not quite that ill, but their functioning remains significantly compromised, that I question myself on when to say enough is enough.\n\nFrustrating things further is I find these patients family members, their outpatient clinicians, are all so disengaged. I find it very difficult to get reliable collateral regarding their \u201cbaseline\u201d, and whether we are back to that. So many have essentially just become wards of the state, and it feels isolating to feel like I am solely responsible for saying \u201cYou\u2019re stable\u201d or \u201cyou have reached maximum benefit.\u201c when their cognitive impairment remains so substanti they are condemned to living in essentially an assisted living level of care.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019ve had many excellent outcomes. So many patients respond to treatment. But it\u2019s how I handle these more treatment resistant cases that I am trying to reflect on. Perhaps this is just me taking too much ownership of what is a very challenging, treatment resistant illness, that has limited treatment options available to us as prescribers. I think part of it is that. Nonetheless, wanted to see how others feel about this topic, or what strategies they have to determining when patients are truly at \u201cmaximum benefit\u201d.",

        "text": "From my very first rotation, I would happily persuade patients that they needed to take an 'antipsychotic', because their dopamine was too high and thus this drug will help reduce it. 'Like insulin and diabetes' etc.\n\nThis is the usual spiel. However, recently I have been wondering how true this statement is...\n\nI like to think that there is something inherent about antipsychotics that is treating the psychosis, but ofc the receptor activity of antipsychotics is extremely variable and clozapine has low D2 affinity.\n\nWe know that meth increases dopamine. And we know that meth can cause psychosis, so for a while this was reassuring that we had got it right. But I then thought that meth also upregulates NA and serotonin etc, and many other drugs cause psychosis that are not so dopaminergic (psychedelics, steroids, cannabis).\n\nI went deep into the dopamine synthesis capacity research and id say it is inconclusive, but broadly in favour of psychotic patients having higher dopamine uptake than healthy controls. But this could well be due to increased movement, arousal, anxiety etc during the scan. Also, many of the studies have healthy controls with higher capacity than psychotic patients.\n\nI saw a Dutch study that is ongoing that was looking at dopamine synthesis capacity on borderline patients - if other conditions also exhibit raised dopamine synthesis capacity then I feel that would also make the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia less robust.\n\nI'm a trainee psychiatrist so I'm still learning, but it does worry me that I may be saying things to patients that are based on faulty logic (or more likely big pharma marketing). Did we just find drugs that work and then assume the cause must be the reverse of the drugs action...\n\nSo I had a few questions - do you have any slam dunk research that makes you fully believe the dopamine hypothesis?\n\nAnd slightly related, I've struggled to find many decent RCTs comparing benzos monotherapy with antipsychotic monotherapy for schizophrenia. Any links? Has anyone here ever tried to treat psychosis with benzos as monotherapy? \n\nI can see in acute agitation of psychosis benzos often are superior or equivalent to antipsychotics (https://europepmc.org/article/med/33681744), which makes me wonder whether they would have been given the moniker of 'antipsychotic', if they'd been invented first... \n",

Over 50% of the patients present for either a suicide attempt, or else they have a history of suicide attempts. I'm surprised by how infrequently lithium is trialed for these patients. When I cover, I generally try to initiate lithium for these patients, whether they have unipolar depression or bipolar disorder. (Regarding schizophrenia, clozapine has been shown to reduce the risk of suicide in schizophrenic patients, although I wouldn't be surprised if lithium also helped.)\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27000268/\n\n\"The anti-suicidal effect of Li has been very well demonstrated. By its specific action on the serotoninergic system, treatment with Li significantly reduces \"impulsive-aggressive\" behaviour which is a vulnerability factor common to suicide and BD. Long-term appropriately modulated treatment with Li seems to have considerable impact on the reduction of suicidal behaviours, suicidal ideation and death by suicide in the BD population.\"\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10826662/\n\n\". . . the massive evidence showing a reduction in morbidity on lithium treatment suggests that systematic long-term lithium treatment of unipolar depression could considerably lower the suicide rate.\"",

        "text": "Hi folks - I'm currently a psychiatry resident in an inpatient psych facility and having difficulty managing a 20F with historical diagnosis of bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features, remote history of opiate/benzo/cocaine/alcohol/marijuana/tobacco use, significant childhood sexual, physical, and emotional abuse who was initially admitted for SI and questionable psychotic symptoms.\n\nShe presented with bright affect, linear/concrete, w/o evidence of mania, and is incredibly insightful for a person of her age. I do not think she has a primary psychotic disorder, and I don't think there's enough evidence to confirm a bipolar spectrum disorder. The picture is muddied by significant substance use history, but she/collateral have confirmed that she has been sober for at least 6 months. Previously on latuda, lamotrigine, and gabapentin.\n\nShe develops episodes of anxiety + VH that frequently lead to dissociation and aggression. While she has the insight to use distracting techniques (music, ice pack) and PRN zyprexa 5-10 mg, these have only been helpful 30-40% of the time. The remainder of the time, she continues to dissociate and escalate to the point of requiring IM medications and multiple staff members to assist \\~1-2x/daily. There is no clear trigger that we can identify. These episodes resolve around 20 minutes after receiving the meds, where she is then able to articulate that she was dissociating and reliving past traumatic experiences with +AVH.\n\nThe rest of her med regimen includes her home meds (lamotrigine + gabapentin) and we've also tried a few scheduled atypical antipsychotics without success, including zyprexa/risperidone/latuda/seroquel. Perhaps considering a first gen antipsychotic such as Haldol for the interim, at least to stabilize her before getting her to a competent trauma therapist in the outpatient setting.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/experience in treating a similar case like this in the inpatient setting? Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n  \nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your assistance and thoughtful suggestions. We ended up revisiting some of the diagnostic criteria with her and family, and she resonated strongly with most of the criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder. I didn't want to label her with the disorder at such a young age, but we were able to work through positive reinforcement (regarding staff intervention and emergency medications). We went through some basic DBT skills to self sooth (urge surfing, distress tolerance, grounding skills) and also discontinued the PRN Zyprexa. Thank you to whoever suggested adrenergic blockade, as she did much better on Propranolol prn. She ended up discharging this week to a residential treatment center! ",

        "text": "Hi all - been on the wards for 1 month now as an intern and I've been getting mixed signals from many attendings and pharmacy about monitoring lithium. Wondering if I can maybe get a consensus here to solidify my learning/clinical decision making. \n\nOverall question is, (1) when do you guys check a Li level, (2) does it really matter if its IR or ER Lithium, and (3) what reference range do you guys use\n\nFrom what I gathered so far, reference range seems to be 0.6-1.2, where 0.8-1.2 is more targeted for acute mania phase. We typically want to get a 12 hour level (for practicality purposes and what most studies are basing their lithium values off of), but a 24 hour would be true trough. One of my attendings noted that if we are going for a 12 hour level, it is advised to increased goal trough of 0.8-1.2 up by 30% to account for being on the \"higher end\". I have not seen anyone else really practice by this 30% rule. Also a lot of other people told me that it shouldn't change much from 12 hours to 24 hours after the last dose... It seems like checking a 12 hour level for either ER or IR lithium is also fine and does not makes much of a difference... \n\nI guess where this comes into play is if a patient has a 12 hour level of 1.25 with normal kidney functions, what would you guys do? I am having pharmacy scream at me to lower the dose but I feel like if going off the 30% rule my attending taught me, the fact its barely above the higher end of normal, and patient is fine with normal kidney functions, it should be ok at the current dose... \n\n  \nI took a look at a prior reddit post about this here and had difficulties coming up with a conclusion [https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1ajoh49/timing\\_of\\_lithium\\_or\\_depakote\\_level/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1ajoh49/timing_of_lithium_or_depakote_level/)",

He is approximately 6\u20195\u201d and 350lb (BMI 40+)- this guy is like a mountain when I see him. He remains to be very psychotic, richly delusional (paranoid and persecutory). He\u2019s very fixated on only taking the ziprasidone and so I\u2019ve decided to do supra therapeutic dosing (after baseline EKG) and so far have gotten him to 120mg AM and 100mg PM, though without any noticeable impact on symptoms. \n\nGiven his weight, could continuously increasing ziprasidone be worthwhile?

I would love to use clozapine but it feels irresponsible since he\u2019s already pre-diabetic and there\u2019s still this issue of him not wanting to take any other medications. \n\nWhat predictable impact might his weight have on dosing and efficacy? \n\nAny thoughts are appreciated!

        "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nSome of you may know that I do not work in the US as do many other users here. I make a point of prefacing this regularly to avoid ambiguity.\nI love the various topics posted but often find some responses to be very US-centric, or at least presuming the US to be the default. This is to be expected and not a criticism, of course.\nMental health policies vary wildly between countries and even states. For this reason I'd like to suggest that posts and comments specify country/state when relevant so as to a) promote diversity b) acknowledge that practices (and opinions) can be different c) help people who have specific queries get the most relevant responses (edit: especially for studies! I have no idea what a PGY-# is, for instance!)\n\nAn extension of this rule would be to also use international nonpropriety names for all medication (except if very specific). Even if some are very obvious like Risperdal and Clozaril, having to Google every name is a bit silly for people who prescribe mostly generics. I bet a lot of you don't know what Leponex and Seroplex are - spoiler, it's clozapine and escitalopram respectively.\n\nThis could also be extended to r/AskPsychiatry - so that people seeking help know that some of us will not be able to provide an appropriate answer.",

        "text": "I have a 20 yo ASD with good verbal skills in residential care since middle school who's been on all the usuals for explosive violence, sexually inappropriate behavior, and chronic irritability.  He admitted to a group home I visit about 6 months ago on: \n\nAsenapine 10 mg sl bid\n\nDepakote ER 500 mg bid (level=99)\n\nTrazodone 100 mg qhs\n\nLevothyroxine 25 mcg, 1 tab q MWF and 1.5 tabs q Sun/Tue/Thu/Sat\n\nMetformin 500 mg bid\n\nFamotidine 20 mg daily\n\nA month ago he began complaining of AH/VH and shared delusions of a tall Native American named Fred following him around and threatening to kill him with an ax.  He spent 7 days in an ER then 7 days in a psych unit where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and paliperidone 3 mg daily was added.\n\nShortly after discharge he started stuttering and its been getting worse.  During my last Zoom he could barely speak more than a sentence.  He's still delusional and suffering AH/VH but he's been more cooperative and is participating in groups.  \n\nA recent lit review mentions \"86 episodes of stuttering in 82 cases.\"  Given the millions on antipsychotics, kinda rare.  But perhaps underreported.  Clozapine --famous for not so much the EPS-- has the most case reports. \n\n>The most episodes of DIS were related to antipsychotic drugs (57%), mostly including clozapine, followed by central nervous system agents (11.6%) and anticonvulsant drugs (9.3%). The majority of the cases were male and between the ages of 31 and 40 years. Repetitions were the most frequent core manifestations of DIS. In 55.8% of the episodes of DIS, the offending drug was withdrawn to manage stuttering, which resulted in significant improvement or complete relief of stuttering in all cases. Based on the suggested pathophysiological mechanisms for developmental stuttering and neurotransmitters dysfunctions involved in speech dysfluency, it seems that the abnormalities of several neurotransmitters, especially dopamine and glutamate, in different circuits and areas of the brain, including cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop and white matter fiber tracts, may be engaged in the pathogenesis of DIS.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8900588/pdf/WJP-12-236.pdf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8900588/pdf/WJP-12-236.pdf)\n\nNice to know that \"Asenapine, in a limited open-label trial for stuttering, indicated improved fluency on well-tolerated doses of 5\u201310 mg ([**Maguire et al., 2011**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00158/full#B37)).\" [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00158/ful](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00158/ful)l\n\nI'm probably going to d/c paliperidone but there's a fair chance this will destabilize the patient and he'll be back in the ER.  Hopefully our state will find an inpatient psych bed someplace.  I don't think that's a bad outcome because group home staff aren't trained in the management of acute psychosis.  But I'll have to make sure the guardian and all the others involved are okay with the plan before I write the order.\n\nIt's probably a long shot but if anyone has experience with drug induced stuttering, I would love to compare notes.",

        "text": "As requested from the previous post, here is the Pokemon artwork I commissioned a while back to help in teaching psych meds (artist: fieri art). The goal has always been to reduce students' and health professionals' apprehension towards this topic. Relevant context before the actual artwork:\n\n* Our curriculum is jampacked into 4 undergraduate years, as opposed to the usual PharmD programs, and includes all areas of pharmacy practice (e.g. industrial, pharmaceutical sciences, regulatory affairs, etc.) so my personal challenge has always been how to fit meaningful discussion of these drugs in the limited time we're allocated. One practical solution I came up with is to basically slash half of the drugs off my syllabus, because \\~50% of psychotropic medications listed in references were never available in our country anyway. This means the artwork is focused on the meds that are both available and most commonly used here.\n* Some of these memory aids were made with a combination of English and Tagalog wordplay, because using multiple languages opens up a lot more possibilities. I'll try to stick to the ones I think will be relatable to a solely English-speaking audience, meaning I can't post all the pieces I've commissioned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that out of the way, let's get to it!\n\n1. Fluoxetine - Fluox (flocks) of hyper children being bullied on the internet\n\nIn this one, Munchlax is playing with a bunch of supposedly bullied children.\n\n* Hyper - reminder of Fluoxetine's activating effects due to its 5-HT2C antagonism\n* Children - Fluoxetine's efficacy in depression in this population\n* Play - representing the multiple drug interactions Fluoxetine has\n* Bullied - usefulness in BULimia nervosa\n* Internet - slight NET blockade\n* Clock on the wall - Fluoxetine and its metabolite's long half-life\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vz12shj0c391.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2240a596b73ccaa6e3298c66ba8abf583a1c42e\n\n2. Sertraline\n\nRedrawing the Stahl serotonin transporter as a pickup truck to highlight the SERT in Sertraline. The heart on the truck highlights the potential (I know it's not been robustly proven yet) for Sertraline's benefits in those with depression and co-morbid CAD. At worst, it's been safely tested in RCTs in this population.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y51sii0c1c391.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7eff7c5ebd8bd373e95e65a8bb54632b0a36580\n\n3. Lithium\n\nThis is mainly to show the difficulty of hitting the therapeutic window for Lithium, some examples of its toxicity, and the interacting drugs that can potentially raise Lithium concentrations to dangerous levels (ANT = ACEIs/ARBs, NSAIDs, thiazide diuretics). On hindsight I should have asked to make the ant a Durant at least.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/atv0ewxq1c391.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f446246dc38f71b991d0db6b80fdf398eaa30d20\n\n4. Antipsychotics and metabolic syndrome risk\n\nThis one was easier to do because the only 2nd/3rd gen ones we have are Aripiprazole, Amisulpride, Clozapine, Paliperidone, Quetiapine, and Risperidone. I pretend Brexpiprazole doesn't exist because the absurd price tag doesn't justify its benefits in a country with high poverty rates and an overwhelming majority that pay out-of-pocket. The mnemonic for this is CoQ-10, except the 10 is drawn as if the 0 were superscript to make it look like a P for Paliperidone. So Clozapine, Olanzapine > Quetiapine, Paliperidone/Risperidone > the rest\n\nAmisulpride was supposed to be depicted as a faded bottle since at the time, I wasn't certain where exactly to place it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwhonz7r2c391.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=91613d5f3b15ad6c8472d96970925a8ec5ddab55\n\n5.

        "text": "Hi  \n\n\nI'm trying to think through a psychopharmacology situation I'm finding myself in more often these days, for some reason. And I'm wondering if my attitude is a minority attitude, looking to poll the members and hear your thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's say you have a patient who's on a particular antipsychotic and is doing well in terms of efficacy. They've started to experience side effects, though--olanzapine and weight gain, for eg.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's your default approach? Would it be\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(a) to protect the olanzapine continuation by doing as much as you can to mitigate side effects? Dietary advice, exercise regimens, reasonable dose reductions?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOR \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(b) to switch over to an agent that hasn't been tried previously, let's say aripiprazole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease note I'm trying to gain an impression of your *default* position - I'm not asking whether you'd never/ever switch or persist. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith me, I'm a hold-the-line guy. I sincerely believe that the medication that brought a person to remission should be continued as far as possible, and that given that the new medication is wholly an unknown, I'd rather persist with the one I know. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis means that I'd hardly ever switch routinely post remission which I'm now seeing some people do. I'd also not switch until I know a patient reasonably well--ie never on the first visit unless I can't help it, and so on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe underlying belief system is that there's something inherently different about each person's response to a particular medication. That the best fit is individual. This idea lies at the core of my strategy. However there's an obvious dissonance here, because if all these meds act on the same/similar receptors in the brain, then there's only a limited variation in response that ought to be expected. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo your internal rules match up with mine? Are you more laissez-faire? Do you believe in something entirely different?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm seeing lots of people respond to the specifics of the Olanzapine-aripiprazole situation, and it's my fault for framing it with that contentious example. I'm honestly looking for a sense of your general attitude. And that does shine through in your answers, thanks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: tl;Dr do you believe antipsychotics are equipotent (barring clozapine)? Or do you think responses are luck of the draw, and changing meds carries risk?",

        "text": "Curious to hear if people have developed approaches or have any resources for this as, for me, it has come up a lot more frequently during covid. A patient on an antidepressant, sedative, mood stabilizer, or antipsychotic develops increasingly impaired LOC for some unrelated reason (covid, hypoxia, exacerbation of some other issue). They've got some comorbid psychiatric disorder that we'll say is reasonably managed and it doesn't look like their medications are *directly* contributing to their encephalopathy . That being said they're minimally responsive (lets assume can still take PO meds) and they're on good-sized doses of often multiple psychotropics.\n\nI don't know if I have any relatively hard rules here. Assuming no obvious signals (i.e. AKI on a renally cleared med, new onset EPS, QTc is scary, etc.) my hope is just to keep someone on the lowest dose that I hope will prevent a psychotic / manic episode that would greatly complicate the hospitalization. Even then though you're giving decent doses of medication to someone who is occasionally only responding to pain. Of course I've seen the flip side too where a medication is dc'd and someone becomes manic or psychotic or delirious in withdrawal greatly complicating their hospitalization. Personally I'm tempted to run lithium or mood stabilizers low-therapeutic or sub-therapeutic ranges in some cases but again I don't feel like I'm basing that on a whole lot.\n\nDo you keep the lithium/VPA therapeutic? What about more sedating / anticholinergics APs? Are you usually continuing Clozapine (obviously dangerous to stop or lower abruptly)? Are you giving the scheduled LAI in the ICU? Are you continuing that Schizoaffective dose of Olanazapine? Benzos?",

        "text": "Hey all I hope you are doing well at r/Psychiatry! \n\nI am a relatively fresh Psychiatry resident and am doing my Adult Outpatient rotation at the moment. I love the relative autonomy granted with booking, scheduling, and (to some extent) managing patients as well as the opportunity to connect with motivated patients. I really enjoy this as witnessing peoples gradual improvement is a huge part of what initially motivated me to choose Psychiatry as a specialty. \n\nI will say, however, that the patient load is lighter than I expected and I find myself worrying about whether I am learning all the topics that I need to know (for instance have yet to manage anyone on Clozapine). We have to log our patient hours and required at minimum 3 hours of patient contact per day (not including charting). I also manage several people with a variety of disorders such as BPAD1, Illness Anxiety, ASD, however they are generally pretty stable and I'm doing  minor medication adjustments. My supervisor is wonderful and we do have a learning objective guide although it is quite vague (learn principles of managing antipsychotic medication, learn principles of managing antidepressants, etc.).\n\nOverall I am aware it is still early in my training but does anyone else have anyone else have any insight on what concretely are the most important topics to learn and master on outpatient Psychiatry? I personally have used the time to brush up on Psychodynamic and Supportive Psychotherapy (theory and practice), skim some material on CBT/DBT, read on managing psychiatric medication side effects (Goldberg and Ernst Text), read relevant chapters in Stahls, reviewed relevant sections of the DSM, and lately been looking at the Carlat Medication guides that were recently posted on here. I just can't shake the feeling that I am not experiencing a practice that is representative of all other outpatient psychiatry experiences (although I know that no single rotation could realistically provide this).\n\nSo my overall question is thus: Can anyone share high yield topics or clinical pearls that they  experienced on their outpatient experiences (or particular topics they thought were important e.g. managing anxiety in BPAD1, treatment resistant depression, etc.) ?\n\nThanks in advance for any wisdom shared!",

There are theories (eg one is that clozapine binds to dopamine receptor \u201cloosely\u201d and this gives it more advantages compared to other compounds with similar properties) but they\u2019re just that, theories. Keep in mind that the 2D chemical formula of a compound doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the 3D structure is the same - even small differences in the 2D formula can translate in very different 3D configurations. \n\nThe efficacy of clozapine is one of the main reasons that make me skeptical of the dopamine theory of psychosis - this is just my personal opinion, but I think that with research it will be shown one day that psychosis has more to do with neuro-immunological and neuro-endocrinological mechanisms, than neurochemical. One thing I have noticed is that the best drugs in psychiatry are the ones that seem more \u201cdirty\u201d in terms of receptor affinity, one of the many challenges to the simplistic notion that psychiatric disorders are just caused by abnormalities in neurotransmission.",

The reason TCAs remain on the algorithms for treatment-resistan-depressions in literally every guide in the world isn't just merely based on old manufacturer approval trials.\n\n\nMy PP is somewhat dedicated to affective disorders, and TCAs are a vital part of my treatment for TRD. And they are absolutely wonderful (if indeed sadly saddled with many side effects). I fully believe the reason ketamine clinics have exploded in the US is due to younger colleagues just not being used to or willing to prescribe TCAs and MAOIs.\n\n\nI know anecdotal data is not evidence, but this is just one of those things... As if you had someone come in and question ECT out of the blue by citing \"the primary evidence is ancient\" (which actually happens from time to time\u00a0 surprisingly from otherwise \"eminent\" and world class researchers, who obviously haven't treated a single patient since residency....

Their functionality typically returns to near-normal levels, allowing them to resume their studies or jobs with minimal disruption. However, there have been cases where patients didn't receive Clozapine early enough, leading to prolonged struggles even after starting treatment. For these individuals, despite responding to Clozapine, they didn't fully regain their pre-schizophrenia level of functionality, likely due to irreversible structural changes. \n\n\nAlso, there have been many patients who didn't respond to Clozapine treatment at all.

I just googled fluvoxamine clozapine and several articles came up, and those led to related articles in pubmed, etc.  the idea is that the addition of fluvoxamine lets you use a lower dose of clozapine while still getting to a treatment-adequate blood level.  This also gives a higher clozapine to norclozapine ratio which has been shown to reduce metabolic effects, although not the risk of agranulocytosis.

Basically, if I follow, with a CYP1A2 inhibitor, you can get a higher clozapine to norclozapine ratio than you would by just increasing the clozapine dose.\n\nI guess what I've never really understood about clozapine is how it and norclozapine differ in terms of effect and side effects.  If there is a difference that favors clozapine, then a 1A2 inhibitor like fluvoxamine could be a clever strategy.  What I'd likely worry about is if the patient happens to be taking other medications that are sensitive to CYP1A2 inhibition.",

A similar effect can be achieved by increasing the clozapine dosage. The actual mg dosage of clozapine is irrelevant due to interindividual variation in the metabolism of clozapine - the level of clozapine in the serum is what matters. I more commonly see fluvoxamine used to coercively increase the clozapine level when a patient refuses a clozapine dosage increase, which is unethical. There may be reports that norclozapine contributes more to the metabolic burden of clozapine and using fluvoxamine can reduce this, but using fluvoxamine is pretty sloppy from a pharmacologic standpoint because the effect can be unpredictable. I would argue that the routine addition of fluvoxamine to clozapine is NOT appropriate.\n\nSee https://smiadviser.org/knowledge_post/is-it-possible-to-use-fluvoxamine-to-improve-the-tolerability-or-metabolic-side-effects-of-clozapine",

Not being snarky, genuinely asking - I think there's a big transatlantic divide here as I've only ever seen one patient prescribed fluvoxamine in 5 years of psychiatry training, and the response from the consultants was broadly 'why would anyone ever prescribe fluvoxamine?'.\n\nFor the purposes discussed in this thread of raising serum levels of clozapine while mitigating against side-effects - as OP says, I can see the theoretical possibility but I prefer not to make my prescribing decisions based on theoretical psychopharmacology. My two usual first-line references for prescribing decisions are the Maudsley guidelines and BAP guidelines. Maudsley say the evidence base is 'too limited to recommend' and BAP guidelines don't even mention it, though they do say that fluvoxamine was ineffective in mitigating against antipsychotic-induced weight gain more generally. I'd probably use metformin, aripiprazole or a GLP-1 agonist if I could get it approved.\n\nAmongst SSRIs it's pretty low down on the efficacy/tolerability scale, so by the time I'd consider using it I would usually have already tried a couple and be thinking it's time to move away from SSRIs anyway. Perhaps if a patient was responsive to SSRIs but had weight gain concerns?\n\nIt's not specifically recommended in the Maudsley guidelines anywhere except social phobia, which is generally managed with therapy first-line here anyway and rarely even gets as far as a psychiatrist. It also doesn't significantly feature in the BAP depression guidelines (Maudsley and BAP are usually my first-line references if I'm not sure of something) except a comment that it's one of the less efficacious/tolerated SSRIs.\n\nThere was a little wave of excitement that it might have reduced Covid mortality so there was some talk of using it more then, but IIRC that turned out to be noise and wasn't supported by meta-analysis.\n\nAll in all I'm not seeing many compelling reasons to reach for it over any other drug, while I am seeing reasons to be cautious. If someone came to me on it I obviously wouldn't stop it without good reason.\n\nOne fairly big caveat is that I've been broadly dissatisfied with the quality of psychiatric training in the UK when it comes to affective or anxiety disorders. With the current state of the NHS, you practically can't get to a psychiatrist for these unless there are significant risk concerns or a severe+refractory illness, and if you do make it to secondary care it's usually for just long enough to be established on a treatment and discharged, so most GPs actually have far more experience than me managing depressive/anxiety disorders.",

So when it comes to specific indications of fluvoxamine (of which there actually are one or two besides OCD) don\u2019t look at the general guidelines for fluvoxamine (which is more of an issue in terms of drug-drug interactions than actual side-effects, it has to be said) versus other SSRIs for depression specifically. And are those studies between depression and Covid talking about high-dose fluvoxamine (250 mg+) or minor starting doses that couldn\u2019t be increased much more because of drug-drug interactions (otherwise the acceptable therapeutic window can extend to 450 mg/d, especially in refractory OCD)?\n\nYou\u2019re right that a lot of clinicians and pharmacists here in the U.K. (even in America; Japan seems to like fluvoxamine a lot, though) are VERY dismissive of fluvoxamine (some young doctors/GPs don\u2019t even know what it is, or they confuse it with fluoxetine) but there\u2019s a lot of benefit to Luvox. It\u2019s like the underrated underdog of SSRIs. A lot of people with certain types or degrees of obsessive-compulsive disorders (or a spectrum-allied condition, like more complex misophonia) are too ashamed to discuss the full extent of their symptoms with their doctors because they know they\u2019ll likely be misunderstood or whatnot (these particular disorders are very misunderstood often-times even at a more specialised psychiatric level) so they just present as someone who has some vague low mood/mild depressive or mild anxiety disorder and that often begins the roundabout of back-and-forth with pointless SSRIs that either don\u2019t work at all or maybe they do something and take the edge off a little bit but don\u2019t deal with the core of the problem. it\u2019s often not until they hit fluvoxamine that the core of the problem gets addressed more properly and they begin to recover more fully. Someone who sounds like they can just be fucked off with sertraline might actually do much better with fluvoxamine specifically. It\u2019s not even that I hate sertraline so much (well, I kind of do, but then I don\u2019t and at the least I acknowledge that it has its place) but it\u2019s very overrated for what it actually is by itself (i.e., not used alongside nortriptyline or taken to the extreme to treat OCD anxieties). As we both know fluvoxamine\u2019s quite a niche one that not all doctors are particularly familiar with so sometimes patients who know one or two onion barks/peels of psycho.-pharmacology will ask for it specifically rather than waiting for their GP to try 5 or 6 other medications before getting to that point. And so long as drug-drug interactions are adhered to (e.g., lorazepam/oxazepam instead of diazepam, atenolol instead of propranolol), there\u2019s literally no reason not to prescribe. It doesn\u2019t make sense to hold back on that fort. If it ends up being just another bland SSRI and no better than citalopram, so-be it but there\u2019s no harm in trialling it. I don\u2019t find sertraline an interesting drug that has much of any personality/unique profile, whereas fluvoxamine is and does. Almost a bit too much of that.\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t need to be like Costco-bargain warfare on New Year\u2019s Day (mine\u2019s avocado oil, lobster, cereal samples, pizza and a nice cake with vanilla rather than jam filling though, if the virtual offer\u2019s going) but sometimes knowledgeable patients will bargain for what they know they need more, and when fluvoxamine is the drug for them it works. All SSRIs can kind of poop out on you (not work as effectively again) after so many months and I have noticed that with fluvoxamine but medications just need to be re-adjusted and changed sometimes in life.",

The literature I\u2019ve seen uses the combination to achieve adequate clozaril blood levels at lower doses of the drug.  The literature doesn\u2019t show significantly increased benefit for levels higher than 300ng/mL, although, as with everything, we all go higher than what the literature says if the patient shows benefit.  I would only push the levels higher than 500 or 600 with a clear target symptom and I would only keep increasing if there was demonstrated benefit for that target symptom.  Even then I think I would try some of the augmentation strategies first.  (Caveat - state hospital psychiatrists do a lot for the sickest of the sick - not going to argue with extreme practice there)",

The only thing that helps my fog are especially STONG cigarettes; and/or nicotine; which nicotine has a big impact on both acetylcholine and glutamate receptors but just in a different profile. When I had COVID-19 for a few months I already had that same exact fog, but COVID made it 20x worse. It feels exactly like COVID-19 numbness and brain fog with lack of motivation. Antidepressants like SSRIs like Prozac and Zoloft and SNRIs like Effexor or Cymbata never helped me WHATSOEVER. And NEITHER Wellbutrin helped either when I was on a 5 month trial. I realize that Nicotine does infact help me a lot, including strong tobacco, but it hits different nicotinic receptors much differently.\nLegitimate sites like the National Institute of Health stated that there are studies that supposedly help my condition. Many people don't understand it whatever and it freaking frustrates me as HELL!!!!!!!!!!\nI also realized that I'm on Clozaril (Clozapine is it's generic name); does impact NMDA glutamate receptors by being an antagonist, but not very similar to Lamictal. I've had this for over 6 years and I am SOOOOOOOOOOOO fed up with this BS!!!!!!\nIf you have any recommendations about this or different trials or studies, I would highly appreciate it.\nThanks so much if you read this comment.",

        "title": "Treatment resistant: What meds should I still give a try next?",
        "text": "Im 22 and have been suffering from severe depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old. I tried 2 depth psychological therapies, one behavioral one and over 13 different meds (SSRI, SNRI, atypical, tetracyclic, moclobemide, neuroleptics) without any success. Nothing helped.\n\nThe social anxiety is one of the biggest sources of my depression and personal main issues. SAD causes me to not go out, not experience anything or new things, not meet people, not socialize, not getting real friends or romantic relationships. By that it kills my self esteem, future perspectives and mood/will to live longer. These were just some examples but all the restrictions you can think of caused by SAD are big contributors to my depression & self esteem. \n\nIm on Mirtazapine now and while its the only one that had a tiny bit effect at least (better sleep, better appetite) I still suffer a lot of daily pain from the moment I open my eyes in the morning to the moment when I close my eyes and lay in be to sleep. I got on Mirtazapine after long break of ADs as my doc told me its very low-risk and she was right, at least regarding side effects (Idk about possible withdrawal) which I dont have any, except for sleepiness after I take it and increased appetite, but I welcome that as I had bad insomnia and sleep issues and Im very skinny.\n\nSo I was wondering if I just give a new med I never tried before a try or try the Mirtazapine + another med as a combo. Im really desperate and just started a new job I really like and dont want to lose, but in my condition right now I cant keep it up any longer if I dont improve mentally. I also registred for the gym and changed my diet, but Im still depressed and anxious af. Also my cognition is very bad, almost dumb, many people ask me if I have ADHD because of my bad focus and memory. \n\nSide info: I always wanted to test for ADHD as Methylphenidate (tried of a friend) improved my symptoms significantly but my previous docs didn\u2018t want to test me for ADHD (in my case rather ADD) 1. before my depression/anxiety isn\u2018t treated as these two can be the cause of ADHD symptoms and 2. because one needs to be diagnosed for AD(H)D in his childhood for treatment. So I just thought I\u2018d never be able to get test or treatment for ADD (which I really fell like having in addition to the depression and social anxiety).\n\nIs there any antidepressant that has low risks for side effects and withdrawal that you could recommend me? Im adding the list of my tried antidepressants below so you have an overview. \n\nMeds to try next I was Thinking about:\nNefazodone\nClomipramine\nVortioxetine\nTranylcypromine (Parnate)\nSelegiline \nProzac (Fluoxetine - Idk surely as no serotonergic worked so far)\nLamotrigine (or any other antipsychotics, because maybe I\u2018m wrongly diagnosed as all these 13 meds of antidepressants I tried didn\u2018t work)\nWellbutrin (tried once but gave up after 1 week as I was having bad anxiety, so quit but maybe I just need more time?)\n\n\nMeds I already tried:\n* Cipralex (Escitalopram) + Promethazine\n* Venlafaxine (Effexor) + Quetiapine (Seroquel)\n* Sertraline (Zoloft)\n* Opipramol\n* Paroxetine (Paxil)\n* Duloxetine (Cymbalta)\n* Moclobemide (Aurorix)\n* Amitriptyline\n* Gabapentin\n* Mirtazapine\n* Diazepam (Valium)\n\nI\u2018m trying to find a new doc at the place I now moved to (new country) so I want to give him a list of meds I\u2018d like to try next that could be finally potentially helping me more than my previous ones when I visit him, so very thankful for any help, suggestions or recommendations.",

        "title": "Memory Loss & Mental Health Medications",
        "text": "Memory loss is a common topic within the mental health world. I'm an RN that works in Mental Health & going to do my best to summarize some research on *which* mental health medications impact our memory and *why* they do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will Include the link to the original post that is probably easier to follow but also going to include all the info below.\n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs**\n\n**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**\n\nDrug class\n\nThis is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain. Over 10% of the US takes an SSRI.\n\nWhat Do SSRIs Do?\n\nWhat does every medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, you\u2019re blocking the neurons from reabsorbing Serotonin, meaning there is more Serotonin available.\n\nSo what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nSerotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. While we can measure the levels in our blood we cannot measure the levels within our brain. Meaning we\u2019re all in the dark as to how much is within our brain and whether or not it\u2019s even correlated to the amount in our blood.\n\nHow SSRIs Impact Memory\n\nAge and gender do not seem to influence the data that SSRIs are correlated with memory effects. Something that is important to mention, is that while research has shown that SSRIs are *correlated* with memory loss, that doesn\u2019t exactly mean that they CAUSE it. Correlation and cause are two different things. Many people that take SSRIs also take benzodiazepines, drink, smoke, have genetic predisposition to memory loss, etc. Depression and anxiety themselves can even cause memory problems.\n\nSummary\n\nSo, after reading through many articles, there overall wasn\u2019t enough credible information to emphatically say that an SSRI causes memory loss. In fact, I came across more research that suggested SSRIs improve cognitive performance and memory. Some data also specifically supported that SSRI\u2019s can improve memory for patients experiencing psychosis and depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tricyclic Antidepressant\u00a0 | TCAs**\n\n**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThe word \u201ctricyclic\u201d refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed before SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays. TCAs are still often administered for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.\n\nWhat do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?\n\nWhat do all TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors. These key differences create a cascade of effects in the body that do impact memory. These key differences are also the culprit for the common side effects in this drug class like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nIn 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 ( a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new 'invention' was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.\n\nHow TCAs Impact Memory\n\nThere are multiple reasons why a TCA impacts our memory. **The first reason** is that we retain memory best when norepinephrine is released at an optimal rate. These drugs block the reabsorption of norepinephrine; which is known to be a moderator of memory. With too much of it, we are anxious and stressed, too little of it and we are drowsy and not as coherent. Either way, the drug has an impact on norepinephrine which directly influences how we store memory.\n\n**The second reason** why this drug class impacts memory is because it competes with our natural antagonists on muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is well documented that these drugs block muscarinic receptors (which is an acetylcholine receptor), and acetylcholine directly impacts learning and memory.\n\n>*\u201cMuscarinic*\u00a0acetylcholine\u00a0*receptors* in the hippocampus and cortex underlie\u00a0*memory*\u00a0formation\u201d\n\nSummary\n\nSo, TCAs are a drug that research has linked with memory impairments and dementia. These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life (even could improve memory if their extreme anxiety was impairing it), while for another it can make them drowsy and leave a bad impression.\n\n\\*Note each drug within the class impacts the degree of these effects a little differently.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling like doing a deep dive into some of the articles I read to gain clarity, by all means, click the links below!\n\n[Differential Cognitive Actions of Norepinephrine \u03b12 and \u03b11 Receptor Signaling in the Prefrontal Cortex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4876052/)\n\n[The effect of tricyclic antidepressants on cholinergic responses of single cortical neurones.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1666268/?page=7)\n\n[A brief history of antidepressant drug development: from tricyclics to beyond ketamine](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-neuropsychiatrica/article/brief-history-of-antidepressant-drug-development-from-tricyclics-to-beyond-ketamine/B5C9D55C6299BC41B237187DB609DB68)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Benzodiazepines**\n\n**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThese are commonly considered anti-anxiety medication (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.\n\nLet\u2019s taco \u2018bout it.\n\nThis drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which slows down our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).\n\nDid You Know?\n\nAnesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?\n\nHow Benzodiazepines Impact Memory\n\nThis drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is advantageously quick acting, the effects linger.\u00a0 Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.\n\nThis is why a rehab center isn\u2019t going to allow the use of 'said drug' while \u2018recovering\u2019. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking 'said drug' while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning & you're not able to remember anything, how can you work on it? The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.\n\nNow, don't shoot the messenger. Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They're an actual life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with *repeated* use we will need *increasingly* higher doses, making the dent in your memory more and more indisputable.\n\nFull Disclosure\n\nMy mother was an addict, benzodiazepines being her drug of choice.\n\nDo you know an addict whose drug of choice is a benzodiazepine? No SHAME, but if so, you can probably attest that **they don\u2019t remember shit.** \n\nHow about an addict whose drug of choice is alcohol? All love here, but you can say for certain, *they don\u2019t remember shit*.\n\nThere has even been a fair amount of data to support that the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s is elevated in those taking the drug for over 6 months. One Harvard study even speculated that it would raise the risk by 84%! Seems unrealistic, but who am I to question Harvard; I'll add the link below if you're also feeling speculative.\n\nAnother point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.\n\nThis is often what is referred to as *\u201crebound anxiety\u201d*\u00a0 because your anxiety is likely to get worse, before it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken long term.\n\nTake it from a nurse who works in mental health; it's not enjoyable being the bystander of a patient trying to escape their benzo addiction.\n\nBut this is why the mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time.\n\nNow, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please don\u2019t go flush yours down the toilet after reading this.\n\nWhen Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is that we\u2019re now in a benzo addiction crisis. We\u2019re learning over time, as a society and those changes don\u2019t happen overnight. And trust me, as a mental health professional I myself occasionally grow infuriated at the amount of family doctors who prescribe copious amounts of benzodiazepines only to later turn the patient away after addiction has crippled them.\n\n[Harvard Article Claims Benzodiazepine use may raise risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/benzodiazepine-use-may-raise-risk-alzheimers-disease-201409107397#:~:text=People%20who%20had%20taken%20a%20benzodiazepine%20for%20three,84%25.%20The%20type%20of%20drug%20taken%20also%20mattered.)\n\n>\u201cRight now I\u2019m having amnesia and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at the same time. I think I\u2019ve forgotten this before.\u201d  \n\u2015\u00a0Steven Wright\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Anti-Epileptics**\n\n**topiramate, topamax, zonisamide, zonegran, levetiracetam, keppra, pregabalin, lyrica, clonazepam, klonopin, rufinamide, banzel, vigabatrin,\u00a0 sabril, phenytoin, dilantin, oxcarbazepine, trileptal, carbamazepine, tegretol, lamotrigine, lamictal, lacosamide, vimpat, valproic acid, depakote, phenobarbital, gabapentin, neurontin**\n\nDrug Class\n\nAnti-seizure medications are commonly used for mood disorders and even anxiety in addition to epilepsy.\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nEpilepsy is caused by **excessive** hyperexcitability of the nervous system therefore, medications in this class are geared toward minimizing excitability. This drug class actually encompasses three different major classes\n\n1. Blocking Sodium Channels\n2. Enhancement of GABA Inhibition\n3. Regulation of Synaptic Releases\n\nWhy it Impacts Memory\n\nOverall, anticonvulsants work in different ways; trust me I rode the magic school for HOURS trying to gain an understanding of them to write this. Truthfully, we still have a lot to learn about them. Their impact is complicated and the effects range based on the dose and drug.\n\nFor instance, Topamax has pretty diverse pharmacologic actions, because of that, it **has** been linked with impaired concentration, cognitive dulling, psychomotor retardation, language and comprehension difficulties, rather extreme effects on short-term memory and working memory, poor verbal fluency and word-finding, reduced IQ scores, abnormal thinking and delayed cognitive speed. Because of this dark cloud of side effects, Topamax is sometimes referred to as 'Dope-A-Max'.\n\nHowever, a more selective medication within the drug class such as Phenytoin or Tegretol are more specific to blocking sodium channels. Overall, they seem to have less impact on memory and cognitive function.\n\nMany of these drugs listed above have an impact on GABA, and long term exposure to GABA agents can alter the functionality of GABA permanently, which means there are potentially permanent consequences to cognition, behaviors, and memory.\n\nPhenobarbital has been linked to lower IQ, and worse effects than Depakote and Tegretol, however it is actually a barbituate. It\u2019s effects are similar to benzodiazepines which you can read more about above.\n\nGabapentin, used for seizures and often mood disorders, belongs to it's own drug class. Still, it **has** been linked to memory impairment. Hence, the name, it also impacts GABA, which as mentioned several times now, certainly plays a hand in our ability to remember. At this point there isn\u2019t enough research to say it\u2019s linked to dementia though.\n\nAs far as drugs for epilepsy, Gabapentin is tolerated much better than many others. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that this drug seems to have more *short term* effects on memory. Some will experience a disorienting feeling or short term memory loss while taking Gabapentin, but the reports of long term memory being impacted are reported less often.\n\n[Long Term Effects of Gabapentin](https://deserthopetreatment.com/sedatives/gabapentin-addiction/long-term-side-effects/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Antipsychotics**\n\n**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics; risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome & Huntington's disease\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nMost drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nOddly enough, memory seems to actually be improved when using an antipsychotic for a person with psychotic symptoms, though there are many that take medications within this class that are not psychotic. So let's talk about that more.\n\nWhy It Impacts Memory\n\nFirst, let's skip back to the purpose of these drugs. Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it's to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.\n\nThis class is broken up into two categories;\n\n**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which do impact the complex way in which we store memories. \\*More movement disorders come with the old ones.\n\n**Second Generation: (new, atypical):** Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors\\*\\*.\\*\\* Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.\n\nWhat do they all have in common? **They impact Dopamine.** Long story short; A delicate balance of Dopamine is needed for memory to function. Since this class targets Dopamine, it's fair to say it has the potential to alter our memory. Whether that's a good or bad thing is specific to the patient, but it's typically an unwelcome effect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Antihistamines**\n\n**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom,\u00a0 hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan,\u00a0 triprolidine, triafed**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different 'generations' & target different histamine receptors in our body.\n\n* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body\n* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion\n* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System\n* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nWe're actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that \\*\\*anti-\\*\\*histamines are usually anticholinergic; **blocking** receptors for choline. The problem is that we need choline to be readily available to have the ability to learn, understand and remember.\n\nWhy it Impacts Memory?\n\nBeing that antihistamines are often anticholinergic, they do impair our ability to think, learn and remember. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain. We already naturally produce less acetylcholine overtime. This is partly why as we age our ability to remember, think, and learn diminishes. It's widely known that anticholinergics impact memory, thinking, learning, and muscle function. It is also suggested that these drugs increase the risk of developing dementia.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways in addition to the reason why it's administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much less specific in their effects, they are affiliated with greater memory impairment. Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, the effects range. Regarding mental health specifically; Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax are commonly prescribed for anxiety. While your risks are much less severe than benzodiazepines, these are FIRST generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this is also means they do impair our ability to remember.\n\nAn example of second generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won't do you much good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the link again for original post below.\n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)",

        "title": "Something about Alpha \u03b1-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists and its use in mental health and psychiatry",
        "text": "The **alpha (*****\u03b1*****) -1 adrenergic receptor antagonists** (also called alpha-blockers) are a family of agents that bind to and inhibit type 1 alpha-adrenergic receptors and thus inhibit smooth muscle contraction. Appart from their use in neuro-psychiatry, their major uses are for hypertension and for symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy. Their use in therapy of hypertension is based on the inhibition of vascular resistance in arterioles from alpha-adrenergic blockade, which results in an increase in venous capacitance and lowering of blood pressure.\n\nAlpha1-adrenergic receptors are engaged in a range of autonomic, neuroendocrine and behavioral functions. These comprise motor functions, attention and vigilance, fear and anxiety, reinforcement, sensory gating, learning, sexual behavior, and regulation of blood pressure and of both the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal and hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal systems (HPA and HPG Axis).Alpha1-adrenergic receptors also regulate mesocorticolimbic dopamine systems and multiple reactions to addictive drugs. They are located primarily in the pre-synaptic regions (unmyelinated axons and axon terminals) of the mesocorticolimbic system, thereby regulating neurotransmission in this area, as well as drug generated modifications in extracellular dopamine concentration and locomotor activation.\n\nHere I quote part of the article \"Alpha1-Adrenergic Receptor Antagonists Use in Treatment and Prevention of Psychiatric Disorders\", by Abhishek Wadhawan *et al*, 2015.\n\n\"**Potential Role of Alpha1-Adrenergic Antagonists in Treating Mood Disorders**\n\nPrazosin has been shown to improve anhedonia, which is a part of the depressive symptoms in hypertensive patients, but prazosin or other A1As have not been formally studied in other mood disorders. It is well known that depressive states are related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system activation. HPA activation is associated with psychomotor agitation and anxiety in both major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Increased arousal is an exceedingly prominent feature of activated depressions, whether they are characterized as mixed states *\\[with features of both melancolia and atypcal-anergic depression\\]* or as agitated depression. Similarly, sympatho-adreno-medullary function is also augmented in a manner that correlates with the severity of anxiety and agitation in MDD or BD depressed patients without manic symptoms, as well as in mixed mania \\[negative mania\\]. It is suggested that increased epinephrine and metanephrine secretion, which is an indication of adrenomedullary activation, are both coherent with increased \u201cdepressive\u201d agitation across MDD, BD depressive states, and in the mixed states\".\n\nBased on their biological mechanism of action, A1As may possibly help in agitated depression and mixed depressive states of BD, as well as BPD.\n\nThe potebntial for Alpha1-Adrenergic Antagonists is vast, from treating Borderline Personality Disorder, to Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and also in treating Psychotic Symptoms.\n\nIt has been shown that elevated level of NE impairs prefrontal cortical functioning via alpha1-adrenergic receptor stimulation.\n\nAnd has been clearly recognized that during stress exposure, higher levels of NE are secreted in the Prefronta\u00f1 Cortex, and it has been further demonstrated that higher NE concentration stimulates alpha1 receptors and weakens prefrontal cortical function. Hence, NE has an upturned U-shaped influence on PFC functioning, implying that both very small and very large amounts of the NE impair PFC functioning.\n\nGiven their unique properties, A1As seem to be promising in the treatment as well as in secondary prevention in psychiatry. Secondary prevention involves interrupting the disease mechanism and preventing future episodes for those who are at risk.\n\nA1As may be particularly useful in secondary prevention in chronic stress mediated conditions, such as children and adults with records of maltreatment in early-life. Alpha1-adrenergic antagonists, due to their strengthening effects on PFC functioning, down regulation of CRF mediated stress pathways and favorable metabolic profile can be potentially effective agents in a number of these chronic stress mediated psychopathological conditions.\n\n**Some Alpha1 adrenergic antagonists** are: **Prazosin** (which is the one with more documented use in psychiatry), Terazosin, Doxazosin, Silodosin, Alfuzosin and Tamsulosin. And **among the commonly used antidepressant-psychotomimetic therapeutic agents**, some with a **strong alpha 1 adrenergic antagonzing properties** are **Mianserin**, **Mirtazapine**, **Amitriptyline** and **Nortriptyline**; also **Clozapine** is one with such qualities. All these agents have much therapeutic value and have shown effectivenes in a variety of psycho-physiological disorders, when the proper profile of the patient is met.\n\nHowever caution is advised with these agents, as depending on their selectivity they can also bring forth some (sometimes) serious side-effects (it seems to be related with the genetic variability in population of CYP2D and CYP2C19 allheles, which can be tested out). For example, until some days ago I was taking amitriptyline 75 mg at night, to augment and boost my Parnate, of which I ran out of stock, and in the meantime of importing the medicine I had to reduce drastically my dose, which very rapidly made me relapse into depression and feel awful again... Amitriptyline worked to some extent, in fact depression after a week was much better, as well as anxiety, and gave me some more euthymia, but soon I began experimenting pain in my organs, even liver (appart from the awfully high heart rate and unstability in BP), but I said, ooh f\\*ck it, and kept taking it as to not feel depressed (I also like how it makes me sleep no matter what), until something really nasty started to happen, which I immediately associated with the inhibition part of smooth muscle contraction of Alpha-1 Adrenoreceptor antagonism; weird incapacity of achieving full orgasm (kind like it was cut in parts and weird, even a little painful), then strange contractions when peeing, which soon became like spasms in my bladder which felt really painful and horrible, appart from not being able to pee appropiately... that scared the shit out of me and finally stopped amitriptyline cold turkey (I may take no more than 25 mg meanwhile my Parnate arrives).\n\nI know Amitriptyline is a great antidepressant, and its own \"dirtyness\" makes its own very effectiveness, as with the antagonism of Alpha-1 adrenoreceptors (among many neurotransmitter inter-actions), and that many people don't experiment this, but for me was very clear, and being that my father have prostatic problems and so (all related to these receptors), I said no more for me, rather feel more depressed and rely on stimulants and kratom a little more in the meanwhile, but not to fuck with my urinary and prostatic muscular system, I don't need more problems.\n\nI include this experience of mine within all the written text, not to scare anyone or negativize things, but just as a reminder to be careful with every psychopharm or whatever substance we use, and be smart and wise.\n\nHope this contribution, as small as it may be, may be useful in any degree.

We\u2019re still waiting to see if the symptoms will subside. Now that could be an exception rather than the rule. I do not have any statistics on occurrences.\n\nETA: I took Abilify for two months with no problems except for some restlessness when we tried to increase it. I stopped it because it pooped out after I caught COVID. Not sure if it was just me or COVID that kept it from working.",

And number 2 isn't true, at least in the US. Some symptoms need to have been present in childhood but you don't have to actually have gotten the diagnosis then. I just got diagnosed with ADHD at 34 (after first being diagnosed with depression at 16 and spending the last 3 years doing therapy and different meds for depression/anxiety.) I know that's harder to access in some countries though. Where are you? It seems you've tried *a lot* of things--if you feel strongly that ADHD may be at the root of things it might be worth seeking another opinion or having another conversation with your doctor.\n\nReading a little bit about complex adhd/common comorbid disorders was informative for me:\n\n>\\[The accepted approach to addressing complex ADHD is to treat the comorbidities first only if they are severe, and, in all other cases, to treat ADHD and the comorbidities simultaneously. This is what makes treating complex ADHD a delicate balancing act \u2013 one condition can\u2019t be ignored for the other(s). Treating ADHD may resolve and improve co-existing conditions. However, comorbidities may also require separate treatment. It is also true that treating just one condition can worsen others.  \n>  \n>This updated paradigm differs from the previously accepted approach of treating comorbidities first, and then treating ADHD.\\]([https://www.additudemag.com/complex-adhd-symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/](https://www.additudemag.com/complex-adhd-symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/))",

None of them helped!! Like at all! I actually think some of them made me worse. I just went on Effexor and I\u2019m on day 5 taking 37.5 mg which is a very low dose I know but  after 7 days I will be upped to 75mg and I wanna say it\u2019s helping even though it\u2019s probably just in my head because I want it to soo badly help me get back to living my life and feeling better but I don\u2019t know I guess only time will tell that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying my best to be patient and give the Effexor time to fully work because out of the meds I have taken this is my first time on an SNRI and I know for it to fully kick  in and work it could take up to 6 week to feel the full benefits BUT\u2026 in the meantime which I want to mention to you is maybe this whole time you have ADHD which has caused some of your anxiety and depression symptoms because for me I feel as those mismanaged ADHD can present itself as anxiety which is why I recently made an appointment with a psychiatrist to get tested for adhd which isn\u2019t until October but if I lived 32 years with undiagnosed and untreated ADHD then I can def wait a few more months so I would say maybe you should find a doctor that will actually listen to you and take you seriously about your adhd symptoms because I can tell you that having to of been diagnosed with it as a child to be treated for it in adulthood is total bullshit and completely NOT TRUE !!! There\u2019s sooo many adults especially in there 20s 30s 40s even 50s that\u2019s are just now getting diagnosed with ADHD most of which probably just became go well at hiding and masking there symptoms there whole life because of feeling ashamed and embarrassed and I can say that\u2019s  also true for me bc I didn\u2019t want to face reality and the possibility that I can maybe have adhd I didn\u2019t want to accept that which is why I\u2019m 32 and just now seeking an assessment and possinle treatment for it if it turns out I do have ADHD which I\u2019m almost positively certain that I do but again I didn\u2019t want to believe that was my problem so I suffered for so many years in pain masking all my symptoms bc I thought I  was just really stupid and lazy and careless and just a complete waste\u2026 I got use it since my whole life my mother has always called me lazy and careless and disrespectful so I started to think maybe I really am a piece of shit but now I realize I\u2019m not a piece of shit and that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to get help and some validation.

I was on antidepressants when I first used Abilify but none are working for me lately and I needed to do something quick so I popped an Abilify. Doctor's will say you need to stay on them to be effective but I'm not so sure about that. In the past year or so, I started to use them more on an as needed basis since I was trying to lose the weight I'd gained from it. Of course I didn't mention that to my doctor. There's no point. \n\nI am still not giving up on finding an antidepressant since my depression and anxiety are pretty bad but at least I know that I can get fast relief with the Abilify. Yes I would give Nefazodone a try. I took it several years ago for about a year but it made me so tired, I had to quit it. I had heard so much positive about it so I was bummed. I don't have many things left to try so I may be headed to an MAOI soon too.",

Still maybe worth a try some day later in my life\u2026 another 3rd try but that time then for a longer serious period. I just wanted to be free of daily meds i guess.\n\nAlso got off kratom, used lyrica for 1 1/2 months almost daily to help get off of it (getting off kratom was very hard). Lyrica helped. I got clean off kratom. Lyrica made me feel stable, sometimes even very very good and social. Now i reduced lyrica again to zero mg but use it when i have social events iif needed (thats my plan as daily lyrica will probably only cause worse issues) got off of it but also started kratom again as i had to study for freaking 14 exams in a short time so thought f it, 2 weeks kratom wont be that hard to get off (i hope), kratom helped / helps me a lot. I got through every exam so far except for 2 (unbelievable!! Thx to my love-hate drug kratom). Hopefully i can get off of it after exams quite painlessly. \n\nThen idk what to do. I surely wanna use lyrica much more carefully and only as needed (probably 2 times a week as limit) and still looking for other meds or ways or strategies to help me on the other days\u2026 idk for real.

Let's say abilify replacing with risperidone. Or lexapro replacing with other ssri. But even then it's better to do the switch gradually unless you're in the hospital under doctors care. I switched from 50mg(!) paroxetine (which i was using 6months already) to zoloft 50mg in just 1 day. But i was in the hospital and doctor always checked on me. Had no problems at all, was very scared what might happen but my doctor was right - direct switch is a thing. But quitting a drug? No. You have to taper it down very carefully.",

        "comment": "I think this article is a bit odd. Problems with withdrawal and discontinuation are something that need to be addressed and primary care doctors typically aren\u2019t great at understanding that. To be fair psychiatrists and psych nurses have always been advocates of taking it slow and steady for me, but my pediatrician and primary care docs both did a \u201csplit the pill in have for a week and then get off\u201d. So since most antidepressants are being prescribed by primary cares (at least in US) they totally should be more read up in the field. \n\nBut I will say that my problem with the article is them not differentiating statistics from SSRIs, MAOI, antipsychotics, etc. The withdrawals from SSRIs can totally suck but overall they are just miles more safer than all of the other listened medications and thus their insane popularity. The withdrawal from an SSRI, can stink, I\u2019ve done it three times now with three different meds. But the consequences of stopping an SSRI vs stopping an antipsychotic abruptly are WILDILY different, and the difference could potentially be the difference between headaches/nausea and suicidiality and psychosis relapse. So this article just isn\u2019t exactly greatly understandable. \n\nIf you are someone who is on SSRIs and looking to get off now or in the future. Just take it slow. If your doctor says \u201coh just split the pills in half for a week and then stop\u201d just tell them, I\u2019d feel more comfortable if we were to take it slowly. There are lots of advice and tapering schedules online to look over and I\u2019m positive that your doctor will not care how slow you want to take it. I wish I spent more time going off on my Zoloft because I decided that I needed to go back on again 3 months later. Perhaps if I had gone down slowly I could\u2019ve picked up on little hints of relapse and elected to stay on, even at a lower dose.",

In the past, I have tried Seroquel, which gave me syncope and ECT changes as well. Abilify, which gave me a serious acute dystonic reaction, Zyprexa that worsened my seizures and some movement issues. I have also had severe side effects with all my epilepsy meds and I also took Lithium for a while which gave me bad side effects. Why do I always get bad side effects? I get that everyone can get a bit og nausea and stuff from most meds, but I always get the serious ones and some even very rare ones. Is there any answear to this?",

She had a head injury at 17 that caused her to lose her sense of smell, as well as experiencing aches on the bump when it got too hot. Also occasional heart palpitations. On rare occasions she suffered from Vertigo later in her life. She would self medicate with weed the last 4 years of her life, but had stopped a while before her death.\n\n\nShe was taking medication for her CPTSD, but was unusually sensitive to them and would experience strong side effects. She started a year ago by taking a half tablet of Escitalopram, she experienced what seemed to be serotonin syndrome, and after trial and error* was put on fluoxetine in the morning and gabapentin at night instead. Both medications caused side effects including dizziness, weakness, nausea, and muscle soreness. \n\n\n(*I'm willing to list all medications tried and symptoms experienced if it could help)\n\n\n3 days before her death she was put on \u00bd tablet clozapine. She took it at night and by the morning she woke up dry heaving, shaking, turning pale, experiencing weakness & dizziness, and had a mild fever. She said it felt like when she was put on aripiprazole. She was told to take only \u00bc later that night. During the day she complained that her hands were feeling numb. Next day she woke up and experienced the same symptoms. The third night she took the clozapine she didn't wake up.\n\n\nShe was recovering from a cold and her psychiatrist says it might have been due to an infection.\n\n\nI'd appreciate any thoughts and will be willing to answer follow up questions\n\n\nIf you've read this at all, thank you \ud83d\ude47\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who took the time to respond, and also those who offered condolences. I had to take a break from this post as it increased my grief. But I talked about it with family and feel better now.\n\n\nI'll do my best to read and answer the questions asked in the comments, sorry for the delay and thank you for your kindness \ud83d\ude47\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\n\nP.S.

Past relevant medications: Clozapine (\\~15 years) and Latuda (\\~12 years)\n\nAlcohol: 1-2 drinks 3 times a month, no smoking or drugs\n\nI had an MRI to evaluate a lesion found on a sinus CT which appears to be a small meningioma. I'll be seeing a neurosurgeon but not really concerned. The MRI did show volume loss which I am more concerned about as I don't know what is normal for my age. I've always been concerned about dementia due to long term use of anticholinergic medications (clozapine and nortriptyline. I have also been on metoprolol for many years and is seems there is evidence for and against it being related to vascular demential). Also, antipsychotics have been consistently linked to small volume loss.  I had an MRI about two years ago that did not identify any volume loss.\n\nThank you very much for any insight.

No adjacent brain edema. The mass is located along the anterior margin of the sylvian fissure. There is adjacent vascularity noted of the cortical veins.\u00a0Ventricles are normal. \n\nThere is biparietal sulcal prominence which could reflect volume loss versus developmental variation. There is slight prominence of a right cerebellar fissure seen on series 4 image 200. No definite evidence of infarction is noted.\u00a0There is no evidence of an acute infarction, acute hemorrhage, other intracranial mass, midline shift, or mass effect. There is no abnormal intra-axial enhancement. \u00a0Flow-voids within the dominant cerebral arteries are preserved.  The visualized orbits are unremarkable.\u00a0\n\nIMPRESSION:\u00a01 x 0.6 cm homogeneously enhancing dural based mass along the right lateral greater sphenoid wing which most likely reflects a meningioma. \u00a0\n\nThere is biparietal sulcal prominence which could reflect volume loss versus developmental variation.\n\n",

Noticed nearly no mood improvement for several months. \n\nThen, I started dating this girl in August 2022, went back to in-person school (post Covid), and started hanging out with friends more. These things helped my mood significantly, dramatically reducing my severe depression.\n\nBy April 2023 (despite changes - the girl & I broke up, etc), my severe depression was virtually eliminated, and this remained the case until late December of 2023. And I felt stable, not hypomanic.\n\nSince December, my severe depression has been creeping in more & more, & I\u2019ve actually been having a really hard time lately, despite feeling good about my external life - hobbies, dating, school, etc. I\u2019ve tried different meds etc, & am set to add Clozapine to my existing Lithium/Gabapentin cocktail soon, so we\u2019ll see if that helps.\n\nBut I\u2019ve recently begun wondering if maybe ECT did have a positive effect for me. I mostly assumed ECT was a flop & that my mood only finally improved because I improved my actual life, but in hindsight, it could\u2019ve been a combo of these factors. And since I haven\u2019t gotten any maintenance treatments done, it would make sense that my mood has worsened in recent months.\n\nI didn\u2019t like getting ECT done for several reasons, but if it makes sense to try it again, I will.

        "text": "This question is about my 18 year old daughter. She doesn\u2019t smoke, drink or do drugs. Has a long history of severe mental health issues which may be relevant because of her meds- primary diagnosis is severe OCD (which was sudden onset when she was 13 and hospitalized  with flu/strep/ pneumonia). She is on 75 mg Clozapine daily. Also takes 200mg Zoloft, 20 mg propanol and a PPI. She\u2019s been assessed by several specialists and they determined she does not have schizophrenia, but her psych thinks she may have some sort of schizoaffective disorder since Clozapine is the only med that works. \nAnyways- due to her clozapine she gets a CBC monthly. For the past several months, her MCH, MCV and hemoglobin have been slightly low and RDW high. However she\u2019s had an increase in bruising and even minor cuts bleeding forever. She had a very small finger cut that bled for so long the college clinic was going to send her to the ER. All other studies normal (von wilebrand panel, PTT, PT, INR, CMP). They put her on Slow FE 2x day and her hemoglobin is back in the normal range at 11.7. \nIn addition to this- she has chronic skin MRSA infections - about every 2 or 3 months. They always clear with antibiotics (doxy or bactrim). She\u2019s been using Hibiclens preventatively in the shower and Neosporon  in her nose daily. Currently has yet another infection on her knee. Finally- she has developed what we assume in asthma in the last 2 months. Every night she\u2019ll start coughing and then wheezing. GP prescribed albuterol and referred to allergist but there\u2019s a 6 month wait. She did have skin allergy testing done a year ago and has a slight dust mite and mold allergy.  She takes Claritin twice daily and Zyrtec and Benadryl as needed. \nIf you\u2019ve read all this - thank you!! I\u2019m just concerned because so many things seem to have popped up at once. Her GP referred her to hematology for the bruising/bleeding but her labs are really just borderline abnormal so not sure what they\u2019ll do. Should we be asking for a referral to anyone else? Could these issues be related?  Her psychiatrist has said she may have to come off the clozapine which is scary since every time she\u2019s tried weaning- she spirals. She has gotten down from 100 to 75 mg which is good. 50mg was very bad \nThanks in advance!",

Its been 1-2 years since I stopped taking it and im still having these weird effects.\n\nI took Clozapine after being misdiagnosed with schizoaffective. I can't remember the dose, but it was pretty high. I could barely lift my head up and would drool on myself, I was tired af. I coughed up mucus all the time, felt super sick at times. I would hear loud noises like banging or screaming, and id wake up with a start in a middle of the night.

I weigh about 180 lbs and I\u2019m 5\u20195. \n\nDx: Anxiety, Schizoaffective, MDD, Hypothyroidism (treating with Levothyroxine)\n\nI was on Clozapine, Prozac, Seroquel but I cold turkey stopped them last month around the 20th. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve been feeling overwhelmingly stressed out lately. I snap and scream at everyone no matter what it is. My temper has gotten worse. I have been dealing with a stalker in my neighborhood and it\u2019s causing my life to go down the drain. He\u2019s hacking into my WiFi, trying to kill me by cutting the breaks on my car, cutting the power to the house among other stuff. No one believes me and I have went to the police and they didn\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t have any solid evidence. \n\nThis has just caused me to have panic attacks on a daily basis. I think I\u2019ve given myself an ulcer from the stress and vomiting. I throw up because of the anxiety. I can\u2019t freaking eat. I have to force myself to eat something or else I\u2019ll get a horrible headache. But most times I just vomit afterwards anyway. My chest hurts on a daily basis. I sweat whenever I get near the windows in my house. \n\nSleep is almost nonexistent at this point. I can sleep, but I won\u2019t. I\u2019m too scared my neighbor will break in and shoot me. I drink 5-6 cups of coffee at night to keep myself awake. When I do try to finally sleep, I just hear laughing outside my house. And the freaking tapping. Constantly tapping and talking! It\u2019s making my blood boil. \n\nNo one in my house even cares. I recently obtained my BSN and I\u2019m supposed to be searching for a job but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t leave my house. I have no desire to do anything but obsess over my neighbor. I just don\u2019t care about anything over than this problem in my life. This is taking over everything.  \n\n It\u2019s too much to me I\u2019ve even just considered overdosing on a large bolus of my dad\u2019s fast acting insulin and ending it all. \n\nI have talked with my therapist and scheduled an appointment with my psychiatrist. On the day on the appointment he was sick. I rescheduled for the 18th. But I am suffering. My head is going to explode. \n\nI have never done ANY drugs in my entire life. Not even opioids. For anything. I\u2019m against it. However, I broke down last night and bought some delta 9 gummies at the gas station. I couldn\u2019t deal with the paranoia and if I hadn\u2019t of tried something to help I was going to end my life. I felt no guilt or fear. \n\nAnyway, it made things worse. Yes, I felt calm but I freaked out and began hearing this loud man demanding that I burn my house down. And calling me horrible names. I stayed up all night pretty much freaking out. It wasn\u2019t helpful at all and I\u2019ll admit I was an idiot. But what to do when you\u2019re slowly killing yourself? I\u2019m freaking my family out here. \n\nThe effects of the Delta 9 has went away now. But I still hear the man\u2019s voice. Loudly. And I\u2019m panicking over my neighbor even more. I\u2019m contemplating confronting him or calling the police on him. \n\nMy dad says I need to sleep. I agree. But how? I can\u2019t take THC products anymore. I tried melatonin which made me sick. I drank cough syrup with antihistamine. Nothing.  I can\u2019t take any psychiatric medicine because I threw them all out. Is there anything else I could take??? I\u2019m about to try to sedate myself with SOMETHING if I don\u2019t relax and sleep soon naturally. My therapist recommended going to the hospital but I am too scared. \n\nAt this point I think the caffeine consumption is edging on dangerous. \n\nThank you.",

I always wait til things are bad before I get any help and I'm still putting off seeing a doctor but I'm starting to worry a lil bit. I was on clozapine when it started but stopped soon after. I know it's a serious medication with serious potential problems. I remember some side effects having to do with leg pain and that's why I'm here. I can't remember the dose but it wasn't a large dose. I was on it for severe depression after I woke up in ICU after my second ECT treatment had bad reactions to the medicine so I couldn't get the full 15 treatments. Basically I just want to know if I should see someone.",

He was diagnosed of PTB last August and has been on TB meds for the past month (Fixcom 4). This monday he dropped down (yes dropped, not fell, not jump) from our 2nd floor balcony to the floor below it (becuase he said he wanted to try doing it) and broke his leg. He has never done this before and he did not seem to have any scuididal thoughts before that. He was rushed to the ER and was thankfully only diagnosed with 3 broken phalanges on his right foot. Now the problem is he cannot stop walking around WITH A BROKEN FOOT even if he wants to. He cannot control it. He also had trouble sleeping at night. Usually after he take his two doses of Clozapine he sleeps at 9-10 PM, but on the day he only fell asleep at 3AM the following morning. He could not stop walking around. We had to baricade his room and the floor just to make sure he does not do it again and our mom is with him in his room. We had a consultation with his Phyciatrist and was told to decrease the dose of Clozapine to 1 tablet at night because INH was interacting with it and was also prescribed Clonazepam and Propranalol to help him try to sleep better.  We got the prescription of Clonazapam the following day from the doctor's office (we only had an online consultation with the psychiatrist). And also went to a different Pulmonologist to discuss his PTB. The pulmonolgist said that instead of taking 2 tablets twice a day, he should take all 4 of them in the morning 30 minutes before eating.  The following day we followed the instructions, 4 tabs Fixcom 4 in the morning, 1 tab of Vitamin B complex at night, then after 30 min1 tab Clozapine at night then Clonazepam an after that. He was able to fall a sleep at 10PM but woke up just now 3:30AM. He cannot stop walking around and it is difficult to talk to him. We used to be able to hold a proper conversation with him like a normal perosn but now he is slow and repeats one statement again and again. \"just wait a minute\" ( I dunno the direct translation).  Any help or suggestion is greatly appreciated. (Please help) We also have another follow-up with the psychiatristlater this morning.

She was completely normal most of her life up until about a year before she was diagnosed. She completed medical training and residency and was a doctor for a while before she started showing symptoms. \n\nShe generally does pretty well. Schizophrenia runs in the family (her younger brother was diagnosed in his early 20\u2019s but is pretty low functioning). She doesn\u2019t require much assistance at all and medication (as long as she takes it) tends to help her seem and feel more or less normal.\n\nShe really only had auditory hallucinations and paranoia for the last 14 years. Over the last couple of weeks she has been complaining of new onset visual hallucinations.

        "text": " Hi, 19m (assigned female at birth) here. I am 5'3\",weigh 172 pounds, and am white. I will get my health record out of the way first because I do have a complicated record. (Sorry for length!)\n\n**Physical Disorders (I do not suspect these to be causing my current problem):**\n\n\\- Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (no changes, but not treated well)\n\n\\- Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis\u00a0(in remission)\n\n**Mental Health Disorders:**\n\n\\- Major Depressive Disorder (not impacting me badly rn)\n\n\\- Anxiety (well managed)\n\n\\- PTSD (slow process, but getting better in therapy)\n\n\\- Psychotic symptoms related to MDD (including auditory and visual hallucinations, episodes of paranoia and delusions, though the latter two are \"mild\" compared to what's expected during psychosis)\u00a0\n\n**Medications I am Taking:**\n\n\u2022 Actemra 162mg injection (weekly)\n\n\u2022 Testosterone 70mg/0.35ml injection (weekly)\n\n\u2022 Metformin 500mg (twice daily)\n\n\u2022 Venlafaxine 225mg (daily, morning)\n\n\u2022 Seroquel 100mg (daily, night)\n\n\u2022 Trazodone 50mg (daily, night)\n\n\u2022 Atorvastatin 20mg (daily, night)\u00a0\n\nI also take vitamin D3, methyl folate, and B12. I do not have a history of low B12, I started taking it when my mom insisted because she had problems from her B12 level.\n\nI do not take any other prescriptions or recreational drugs.\n\nI have been on all of these meds for a while except seroquel, which leads me to...\u00a0\n\n**The most important info:**\u00a0\n\nI recent came off of clozapine from 100mg. I had to do this and had to do it rather quickly because the medication started giving me seizures after being on it for over a year. The tapering process took 4 weeks. Immediately after, I began taking seroquel and I am increasing the dose steadily.\u00a0\n\nDuring the transition process, my body and mind became absolutely wrecked. I was having a small hypomanic episode for about a week. As of the past few days (4-5 days) I am feeling better and I am back to a state I would consider normal, though losing clozapine has made my psych symptoms worse in some ways. I have bouts of extreme anxiety where I feel my heart is beating so fast that I will pass out. However, I feel no mental indication of anxiety, only the physical feeling. My thoughts are not anxious and I think I am handling the increase in some psych symptoms well.\u00a0\n\nOne major change that aligns with my med change is a drastic reduction in appetite. It started while I was tapering, so introducing seroquel was not the cause. I would say my appetite changed happened at the start of February (probably the first week) Also, I have been on seroquel before, but it has been about 5 years since I tried it.\n\nAt first, I thought my appetite was reducing naturally as I came off clozapine. I had no doubt that my appetite would even out once I stabilized.\u00a0\n\nHowever, I can barely eat and it's been about a month of transition time. I have no desire to eat - no feelings of hunger, no indicators of other health problems (haven't been sick in a long time, stable in all other ways except select psych problems). I also just don't like eating and I can't stand food. I don't feel nauseated or have actual stomach issues, my brain just thinks food is gross. This is a drastic change in behavior because I love food and I love eating. I have always had a sweet tooth that made sweets hard to resist. But now I don't have any desire to eat anything, no matter my previous love for them.\u00a0\n\nI eat 1 small meal a day with the addition of a bit of coffee (only 1 mug, which has been normal for me) with the addition of milk, nothing else. Think 4oz of chicken breast, 1/2 cup vegetables, and 1/2 cup rice for my daily meal. \u00a0\n\nI have been overweight and my weight gain happened in the past 2 years due to life and med changes. While I could stand to lose weight, I have lost the weight unintentionally. In one month I lost about 15 pounds and I seem to continue to lose. Obviously, this is a result of not eating, so it's not unexplainable.\n\nDespite my lack of eating, my body feels fine. I am not tired or fatigued. I do not feel light-headed or woozy or nauseated. By all accounts, it feels like I have been eating a healthy diet and others have said I look fine.\n\n**My question:**\u00a0\n\nI know my body is adjusting to my medications. But, in most ways, I feel stable. I have not had any illness or contact with someone who did. While I am comfortable to wait this out for now, I want to know when I should be concerned enough to visit a doctor, assuming this does continue??\n\nI have told my therapist and psychiatrist about this issue, but they do not seem worried about my eating. I would contact my psychiatrist again, but she left for vacation.",

She went inpatient voluntarily and stayed for a month then was out for 1.5 weeks then went in again until Jan 6th. \n\nShe went cold turkey off her meds (lamictal and depakote) and started experiencing a tremor and couldn\u2019t sleep and had some unexplained bruising on her legs. I had to re-admit her involuntarily on the 12th as she was making plans to procure fentanyl to attempt suicide with it (she is *not* a drug user).\n\nThis time in inpatient she still had the tremor even after they gave her benztropine and I was told it was likely a side affect of one of her antipsychotics. They also put her on the medication clozapine. Not sure what her exact psych med set is at the moment.\n\nShe experienced two falls while inpatient (no injuries/nothing reported broken) likely due to the tremor (she does not have parkinsons but they called it parkinsonism) she was also experiencing the side effect of akathisia I believe (starting early January at least). They put her in a wheelchair after the second time.\n\nUntil this second fall my mom was calling me frequently on the phone (often to ask for fentanyl) but these calls then stopped but I assumed she had stopped wanting to talk to me.\n\n**What Happened:** \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOn Saturday I got a call at 12:06 am because she got a uti (assuming it was from a catheter) and was being transferred again to the medical hospital. \n\nI heard nothing back until yesterday where we got called that they had found her on the floor of her room sometime in the morning/late morning. At first I heard she might\u2019ve aspirated something (possibly vomit) but it seems she might\u2019ve also gotten blood clots from her legs and experienced a pulmonary embolism? (They found the right side of her heart that pumps blood to the lungs was enlarged likely from backflow from a blockage in the lungs)\n\nThey ended up having to do cpr on her for 30 minutes before they got a rosc and while transferring her to the icu she coded again.\n\nDoc told us to come down and visit as they said things didn\u2019t look good (this doc was pretty blunt), it sounds like her survival yesterday was more of a surprise than the expectation.\n\n**Current Situation:** \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYesterday when I finally managed to show up (around 5:30pm) her heart rate was ~125 now this morning it was at ~75. They also improved her blood pressure yesterday (started at 4 whatevertheycalledits and now since yesterday afternoon they only need 2 of those whatevertheycalledits for her blood pressure). \n\nShe\u2019s been intubated this whole time and her kidneys seem to be doing better I think (she had needed dialysis earlier). They also gave her a medication to reduce clotting (a blood thinner I\u2019m guessing, I forget the name, it has thrombo in it)\n\nThey kept her cool with a hypothermia ice blanket thing to minimize brain damage/help with recovery. I also saw them doing an eeg yesterday and there was brain activity on her scan but they called her brain \u201cslow\u201d but said this wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected considering what just happened and we can still expect recovery.\n\nToday they took her off sedation for a bit so the doctors could see her un-sedated. She was blinking to a degree but her eyes stayed half open and half rolled back (not moving). She also has the tiniest response to peripheral pain stimuli in her right leg (so slight the doctor noticed but the nurse didn\u2019t). She seemed conscious enough to not like the intubation tube as the nurses said she was using her abdominal muscles with it. She didn\u2019t respond to any of the doctors or nurses loudly calling her name. They put her back under sedation and haven\u2019t stopped the hypothermia treatment yet and it\u2019s only been a day since she almost died so I expect this is pretty early in terms of recovery (I heard this takes at least 48-72 hrs minimum, and could be longer like 5-7 days or maybe even longer).\n\nYesterday one of the docs said septic shock from the uti could have also played a role in her cardiac arrest (along with other stuff) and they were putting her on a broader swath of antibiotics, today when I asked about her uti it sounds like they have it under control at least. They seem more concerned about block clots at least than her uti.\n\nAccording to that same resident, her psychiatric problems are \u201cthe least of her concerns\u201d right now.\n\nThey took her in for a scan earlier today to check for more blood clots and I am yet to hear back on it.\n\n**Questions** \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNo sugar coating, what do you expect to happen? (idc if you\u2019re right I just want to hear your thoughts)\n\nHas the worst most likely already happened?\n\nHow often do patients relapse at this stage?\n\nWhat were the chances of her even making it this far?\n\n(Not asking for medical advice since there\u2019s already plenty of skilled professionals that have more info on the situation than I can provide here on her case)",

My last period (before this one) came around 28-29th September.

Prior to that I had a mild sense of dizziness for  two days. The dizziness became really bad with the bleeding. I went to my gynecologist, she gave me Ibuprofen 800mg to drink once a day for the cramps. She did an ultrasound of my lower abdomen and she said it's fine , just an early period. I had a lot of stress at home in the last month and I also started indoor cycling every day. Today the bleeding almost stopped but I feel so dizzy. The gyn. Told me to be still and not to move a lot. She also said that the dizziness may be a symptom of something else, like??? I don't understand what has happened to my body !!! I just know that I started getting dizzy two days before this period and am dizzy still. I can move around the house or outside on the lawn but I can't really move a lot!! \nYeah it's good to watch TV shows all day and lay around eating chips but I wanna feel normal again!\nSo I'm here asking u docs, any ideas what this might be? \n\n\nI also have a diagnosis of \"inappropriate synus tachycardia\" but I am waiting for my Holter ECG still..\n\nIf u need more info just ask I hope I haven't forgotten to mention something important\n!

        "text": "Hi r/askdocs, \n\nI'll try to keep this brief, but include relevant info. \n\nSo, when I was about 14 years old, someone tripped me up in school and I landed on my hands. I heard a crack and instant pain. I couldn't move my hand or wrist for the rest of the day, but I powered through the day because I was embarrassed and it had been bullies that tripped me up. \n\nAnyway, I told my mum and she took me to A&E where they did an x-ray and told me I had a hairline fracture in my arm bone near my wrist. They put my arm in a cast for a few weeks. \n\nIt was from this point on that I noticed a small, round lump in my hand, but never mentioned it to anyone because I didn't have pain and it wasn't causing any problems. \n\nI decided to mention it to my GP several (maybe 7) years ago. She sent me for an ultrasound on the lump where they discovered that the lump was made of bone. They then sent me for an MRI on my hand. When I saw my GP for the results she said that it was normal and that I just had a \"misformed bone\" and that it was nothing to worry about. \n\nSo, now, 14yrs after I broke my wrist, I have started getting shooting pains in my hand running along my fingers and sometimes up my arm but stopping at my elbow. The lump was never there before I broke my wrist and I can't help thinking that the bone was misplaced when I fell on it, but obviously I don't know for sure. \n\nI'm tempted to go back to my doctor and ask for a second opinion. I'm presuming the MRI images would still be on my file somewhere for a new doctor to review them? If this isn't just a misformed bone, what could it be?\n\nI would post a photo, but it's difficult to see in photos. It's a pea-sized lump that doesn't stick out a lot, but very easy to feel if you run a finger over it. Hope that makes sense! \n\n\n\nRelevent info:\n\nAge: 28\n\nGender: Female\n\nWeight: 12st\n\nHeight: 5\"10\n\nRace: White British \n\nDuration: Lump 14yrs, pain 1yr \n\nExisting medical issues: Schizoaffective Disorder, PTSD, PCOS \n\nCurrent medication: Clozapine 250mg, Lamotrigine 150mg \n\nDrink: No \n\nSmoke: for 15yrs, but quit 1yr ago. \n\nDrugs: No \n\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "Male, 29 years old, 6'1, 176lbs, don't drink, don't smoke. From Russia.  \n\n\nHello,  I kind of need a dental + psychiatric advice. Sorry for mixing it all together. \n\nI've been taking Clozapine ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clozapine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clozapine)), atypical antipsychotic as a sleeping pill for 6 years straight before going to bed,12.5 mg prescribed by my physiatrist. I've been having problems with sleep (couldn't fall asleep for hours) since I was 4-5 years old, social anxiety, and complete lack of focus and attention. Started seeking mental help when I was 23. My main problem was with my sleep. I slept 5 hours a day and felt terrible because of that. First I and my doctor tried 2 antidepressants, didn't really improve my sleep and then he prescribed Clozapine and it works just great. I fall asleep very quickly, sleep 9 hours straight like a baby and wake up full of energy. I know it is not the best option cause it can cause agranulocytosis. So this drug completely changed my life for the better but lately I started having gum issues and I wonder if it is related to my medication.   \n\n\nI developed a severe (on some teeth 9 mm)  generalized (on almost all teeth) gum recession, mostly the situation escalated over the last year.  One of the side effects of Clozapine includes dry mouth and I started to notice that I have it only recently (didn't pay attention before). I read that dry mouth can lead to gum disease, tooth plaque and gum recessions. Important to notice that there are some other things that I did that could cause it such as intense brushing horizontally which led to gum bleeding, bad hygiene (very often I didn't brush before going to bed), and no flossing. Also I have a distal bite and crooked overcrowded teeth. Also a lot of tooth plague even though I had a professional dental hygiene 6 months ago and now I brush properly. The situation is escalating and I can see my gums slowly receding month by month. I went to the orthodontist and I might install braces soon if x-rays are all right. But I have a burning sensation in my gums all the time, my mouth is dry and there is not enough saliva, dry lips. Basically I don't know what to do now, cause if I want to save my teeth and gums I need to quit my medication and I will feel like shit again. And If I don't quit I will lose my teeth and gums. Also I read that other antidepressants and antipsychotics all cause dry mouth so there is nothing to substitute it to. I tried to quit recently and for 3 weeks I slept about 4-5 hours a day, felt really tired and had skin rash (everything was itching but no signs on the skin), it was hell and I started to take it again. What should I do?",

        "text": "Hi Docs, I am looking for some advice regarding a small bowel obstruction. So on May 29th I started vomiting after dinner. I occasionally get vomiting from my psych meds so I just went to bed early and took some Gravol. I then woke up at 0400 and started vomiting green bile. I then vomited every 20 minutes. No diarrhea or constipation. Around 7pm I had enough and went to emerg for fluids and ondansetron to stop the vomiting. While there they did a CT scan and found a small bowel obstruction. I consulted with a surgeon and they decided to try an NG tube first. So for the next 2 days I was admitted and hooked up to the NG. They then gave me Gastrographin and did xrays and they said the obstruction was cleared. They advanced my diet from NPO to clear fluids to full fluids like milk and yoghurt. With the full fluids my abdo pain and nausea came back. I then started to get diarrhea. They discharged me anyway and I was ok trying to recover at home on the Tuesday. On Friday things still hadn't improved and I was vomiting and had extreme diarrhea where I barely made it to the bathroom on time. I checked in with my GP and she said go back to clear fluids and she would refer me back to a surgeon. On Saturday I went back to ER because the diarrhea was every 20-30 minutes and was dark green like bile. They gave me fluids and ondansetron again and sent me home. The past few days have been awful with non stop diarrhea and I can't keep fluids down at all. So my question for you is, how much of a squeaky wheel do I need to be? Do I keep up with home treatment and hope to improve or do I go back to ER or nag the surgeon's office? Am I at risk for a bowel perforation? Any advice would be helpful. My pain is about a 5/10 with Tylenol every 6 hours even through the night. Labs in hospital showed elevated WBC and elevated liver enzymes and low potassium.

Specially when I started abilify I started having thought insertion/thought withdrawal delusions and was hospitalized. I was then put on more medications and the delusions got worse I was also extremely agitated and was put on several different medications like risperdal and latuda until I quite them altogether and within a couple months the psychosis ended. \n\nSomething similar happened when I was 21, I had an even worse psychotic episode involving similar delusions that went on for months and medication seemed to make it worse it was horrible. I have now been off medications for over a year and have not experienced psychosis. Is it possible that I had medication induced psychosis?

        "text": "Her details:\n\nAge: 60\n5'5, 140lbs \nFemale\nClozapine (Formerly Haldol)\nSmoker\nSchizophrenia\n\nThis is more of an administrative question than a medical one. My mother has been at an inpatient facility for a little over a month now after having a schizophrenic episode. I'm concerned about the quality of care that she has been receiving as well as the severe lack of communication between myself (her proxy) and the staff.\n\nThe facility she's at is quite reputable and I generally assume that the staff are trying their best at treating her. However, I don't see eye-to-eye with her Doctor and he has totally dismissed my concerns and objections to his treatment plan for her.\n\nMy question is what can I do to elevate my concerns and how can I effectively exercise my position as her son and health care proxy to have leverage over what happens to her. The current plan is to have her transferred to a state hospital, after already being in this inpatient facility for an unprecedented amount of time. I think it's fairly demonstrable that she is now no longer a harm to herself or others. I believe her Doctor has somewhat unrealistic expectations of keeping her inpatient and increasing her dosage until her delusions go away entirely. After a few weeks of treatment, her mood has improved substantially and most of her most upsetting delusions have gone away.\n\nAt her baseline, when she's fully medicated, she is fairly asymptomatic and has no delusions. However, in my experience, some of her delusions after an episode can hang on if they are not explicitly disproven to her. Example: She states that people are always trying to break into her house and steal her things. Doc wants to throw medicine at her until she stops saying this. However, if she's properly medicated, she'll stop saying this once she returns home and sees for herself that nothing is wrong. But before then, she'll rely on her faulty memory.\n\nIn either case, the delusions that have necessitated her to go inpatient are now gone, and I do not see any reason why she cannot continue her treatment outpatient. Instead, they plan on transferring her to a state hospital. Assuming the transfer will take about a week, and that her stay will be at least a couple, that's an extra month of additional time in.\n\nI certainly don't want her to be taken out prematurely, but I find it much harder to justify her being kept for so long. Her psychiatrist is rudely dismissive of my concerns and insists that she needs further supervised treatment. I am concerned as well about her physical well being after her social worker himself informed me of a higher influx of patients into the facility who are violent and need stronger levels of intervention.\n\nTL;DR - What can I do about this?\n\nSome additional context: Her psychiatrist has changed her medication to Clozapine from Haldol. Clozapine is generally administered as a last-in-line treatment due to the low possibility of severe side effects, but is also the most effective antipsychotic and risk can be reduced by monitoring treatment. Conversely, Haldol though effective for my mother carries a long term risk for tardive dyskesia. So the doctor has prescribed her Clozapine and monitored her white blood cell count. I'm somewhat cautious about the change, but I do understand it, in spite of her Doctor reminding me that I do not have any medical training and so my concern is unjustified. Taking her medication and getting regular testing is the only intervention that's currently being done for her, and I'm confident that I can supervise this myself.",

I'll just be sitting watching TV and suddenly my heart will feel like it's fluttering and pounding. My heart rate will shoot up to about 125bpm and then fall a few seconds later to about 80bpm. The time between the palpatations will be maximum 60s. This will happen over and over for an hour and a half before the time between the palpatations gets gradually longer. \n\nI actually called 111 (non emergency health advice UK) a couple of weeks ago and after a telephone assessment, they told me to go to A&E within the hour. \n\nSo I did and not long after getting to the hospital, the palpatations were getting less frequent. The nurses checked my blood pressure (which was high) and my heart rate was 127bpm at the time. They did an ECG and a chest x-ray and the doctor came to discuss my results and told me that the tests came back normal and that he thought it was a big panic attack.\n\nSo anyway, this has happened almost every day since then. Some days I can sit with it, some days it hits hard again and I just feel like I'm going to die. \n\nI don't know if this is related, but I've been feeling more and more lethargic in the last few days.\n\nI called my GP the other day about it all and she said she wants me to have a blood test (thyroid I think) and a 24hr ECG. \n\nI think this is likely anxiety, but I honestly feel like I'm dying. What gets me is that there doesn't seem to be a psychological trigger. And also, this always happens in the evenings. I don't know, I hope it's nothing serious, but it's difficult. The GP said it could well be anxiety and she contacted my MH team who agreed to prescribe me Promethazine. Sometimes it helps, but even when it does, it takes a good 40mins to kick in. And they won't prescribe me anything stronger (like diazepam) because I'm on a lot of medications. \n\nSo, my questions are:\n\n- How likely is this to be a physical problem instead of psychological? \n- How do I manage this if it is anxiety? It seems to be getting worse and breath techniques don't help at all at the time. \n\nAnyway, thanks to those of you who've taken the time to read an especially if you reply. \n\n\nMy details: \n\nAge: 28\n\nGender: F \n\nHeight: 5\"10\n\nWeight: 13st 2lbs \n\nDiagnoses: Schizoaffective Disorder and PTSD\n\nMedications: Clozapine (225mg), Pregabalin (400mg) and Lamotrigine (150mg) \n\n\nThanks again!",

I got hot, my heart started racing and I started breathing deeper/normally. Usually my mental/cognitive state is pretty shitty due to years of neuroleptic use. Started taking guanfacine off label for possible other condition 3 months ago.  Thought process started \"budding\" or it was nice to think a few days leading up to apnea event. After waking up the next morning the thought process is mostly gone and have not attained it again. Memory returned to state before taking guanfacine but is getting better.

I have been taking ferrous polysaccharide (150 mg) since diagnosis; still, the problem persists.

Tissue Transglutaminase Ab was negative also.\n\nI have since been referred to a hematologist, whom I will be seeing in the near future.\n\nRecently, I underwent a serum protein electrophoresis test; all of the results were normal, except for the beta 2 globulins, which were elevated at 5.3 g/L (ref. range 2.0 to 5.0). I also was subjected to a C. reactive protein test (high sensitivity), which was elevated also at 4.9 mg/L (ref. range <4.8 mg/L).\n\nI would greatly appreciate any informed speculation on your part as to what is causing this phenomenon.",

        "title": "Bipolar boyfriend and his levaquin (levofloxacin) induced psychosis... what to expect?",
        "text": "- 27, male\n\n- 6', 170 lbs\n\n- Caucasian\n\n- 3 days of hell, 2 days medicated\n\n- Mental changes, some physical discomfort\n\n- Existing medical issues: Bipolar 1, had epididymitis(reason for levaquin)\n\n- Meds: Was taking armodafinil fairly regularly, took 3 levaquin,  has discontinued both, and is currently taking clozapine(100mg?)\n\nConcerned about testicular pain, he went into an urgent care and was given antibiotics and was diagnosed with epididymitis. He was told that his urine was clean(?), not sure how they would know so quickly, or what they even meant by that, but that is what he was told. Pretty soon after beginning the antibiotics, he started having uncomfortable physical symptoms, including light sensitivity, some pressure in his neck and a little pain in his chest if I recall correctly. This was causing him discomfort, but he seemed psychologically okay. \n\nAfter the 3rd pill/day, he woke up and told me about a terrible nightmare that he would keep referencing to over the next few nights, believing that it was significant/real. I also noticed he was very loopy and delirious, walking around the house moving things around, totally out of character. It was as if he were on ecstasy or a hallucinogenic drug. This lasted the whole day. I researched the possible effects of the antibiotic and made the connection, so I told him to stop taking it. Throughout the night he was loopy and looked high as a kite. I took his temp a few times, and it was normal.\n\n In the morning he woke up and was a little more normal acting. He went to the ER with his father, was given azithromycin and a ceftriaxone injection and they sent him on his way. He came back later in the night and seemed a bit better. However, we had beer in the house and when I decided on having a bit, he insisted that he drink too, even though I said that he should not drink. Anyway, he ended up drinking 3-4. He was far more agitated and irritable than I had ever seen him in our 7 years together. He was downright mean and decided that we needed to argue... Very stressful and worrying. \n\nThe next morning he was apologetic and seemed a bit off, but not as wild as he had been. However he gradually progressed into some pretty nasty psychosis. Terrifying to me, considering that I had never seen him like this before. He was bad enough that I called his parents and asked them to take him to their house, because they had dealt with this before. He was talking complete nonsense and even threatening me a bit. He was trying to be very sexual, which was disturbing, considering I was clearly not calm or comfortable with that at the time. I was exhausted and scared.\n\nThe next day we saw his psychiatrist, who told us that this was primarily caused by the levaquin, told him to keep taking the clozapine for a week and then we'll go from there. \n\nThese past two medicated days he has been medicated and self-aware, realizing that he has been delusional, but telling me that he is coming back to reality. I do notice some irritability, but am not sure if it is mania, medication or both.\n\nFor the time we had been together, he had never swung into a manic phase, maybe had been on the edge here or there, but nothing noticeable. Of course I had never seen him in psychosis, but he had experienced it before. I should say that he has not been medicated for long-cycling bipolar for some time, he was managing without meds, generally by making decent lifestyle choices, etc. Looking back in the past month or so, I do think he was a little manic leading up to this, but nothing too wild, just less sleep, a bit more talkativeness and excitability.\n\nI'm sick with worry, he is staying with his parents so I can get some rest. I am not sure how to deal with this appropriately, what questions to ask doctors, or if the doctors have gaps in their knowledge. I guess I just want any advice that anyone has so I can help him/us navigate through this process. Even if you don't have advice I would appreciate any other resources/suggestions. Thanks. \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hi. So I've had issues like adult acne and folliculitis off and on even into my 30's, been to numerous dermatologists over the years but my current insurance doesn't cover derm visits so I only have my GP to go to. Don't really have acne anymore thank god, but over the past year or so I've had persistent dry, itchy and flaky scalp. (relevant pic and my details at the bottom). \n\nMy GP prescribed ketoconazole 4 or 5 months ago(I asked him to identify specifically what condition I have but he was evasive). I used as directed, seemed to help for a while but then it would recur. I don't think it's folliculitis b/c it's only flaking, like bad dandruff. This episode began roughly when my g/f moved in with me last year. We do share a bed, and while she doesn't have this problem, she does use a lot of hairspray and various products that I've learned to avoid since my skin is very sensitive. (her hair brush is caked with white gunk and pretty gross). I suspect there's a correlation b/c she has schizoaffective disorder, and she has real trouble with common sense things like being aware of her surroundings, or what she did 3 minutes ago. I mention this b/c she regularly forgets to flush, or wipe herself, for example. She also takes Clozapine and sweats and drools heavily at night.) \n\nAnyway, I just bought T-Sal shampoo with the coal ash in it (instead of salicylic acid), bought a new detangling comb, and threw out my hair brushes. I have long curly hair which I really don't want to cut if I can avoid it. I like my hair long and want to know if a doctor would suggest I cut it to help my scalp heal? I shower daily and wash my hands frequently.\n\n37, male, 190 lbs, Italian/Mexican, live in US (MD). I take Vyvanse (started ~ 1 month ago switching from Adderall, Ativan, Propanolol, Allegra-D for seasonal allergy. History of Major depression, ulcerative colitis, GAD, ADD. \n\nthanks in advance. I don't have a smartphone but this pic I found is pretty close.\n\nhttp://www.bestremedies.net/wp-content/uploads/how-to-get-rid-of-dandruff-in-one-wash-e1449204128448.jpg",

In the US, patients need to be registered with a national monitoring service and have weekly blood draws for the first six months of treatment (spacing out after that eventually to once a month for the duration someone is taking the medicine). If they miss a blood draw, the pharmacy can\u2019t dispense the medication. \n\nDid she have bloodwork done in the days prior to starting the clozapine? Specifically an Absolute Neutrophil Count? \n\n\nClozapine comes in multiple strength tablets, so without knowing the dose of the tablet it\u2019s impossible to say if the starting dose your sister received was appropriate. Even so, I would not expect 3 total doses to result in severe enough myocarditis to cause sudden death if there wasn\u2019t some underlying cardiac issue. Given her history of an eating disorder and palpitations, there is certainly possibility that she had some cardiac damage.",

        "comment": "I am very sorry for your loss and uncertainty OP and don\u2019t wish to add to your grief. It can be difficult to know what happened if the hospital does not do an autopsy (without you paying), and I am very sorry that this is the case where you live. \n\nI feel that clozapine is an unusual choice for your sister\u2019s CPTSD, if she did not experience psychosis, though I am not sure how severe her symptoms were or how many medications she tried that did not give her enough help. It seems to me that she was on fluoxetine and gabapentin that were helping, but from your comments the clozapine was added to help her get off weed (I understand it is illegal there) or to help her sleep after her father and stepfather\u2019s death. This reasoning (if it is complete) for starting it troubles me (for this particular medication) as well as the fact that she was not told to have tests prior to starting (including the ECG and bloods), also the fact that she was not told to seek medical attention and stop the medication when she was having side effects. I recognise that I am not a psychiatrist and there can be more to the story (I don\u2019t know her full case), also that you do not wish to blame any one person but look at the system and possible causes. \n\nI do understand that her case may be complicated and that certain drugs may be used off label in such cases, and that she may have a genetic predisposition to metabolising medications differently / being more sensitive. \n\nIt may be possible that her cold was COVID which very rarely causes unusual and severe symptoms even in the young (blood clots, heart attacks, myocarditis, arrhythmia). \n\nClozapine can cause agranulocytosis and myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, as others have said, usually not this quickly though it is possible. It can also cause arrhythmias. \n\nAgranulocytosis (and myocarditis) can present with similar symptoms to hers, though It is possible that there was a combined effect of a decrease in her blood cells and an infection. \n\nClozapine rarely can cause a prolonged QT on her ECG that can predispose to arrhythmias, as can fluoxetine though it has less of an effect than some other SSRIs. Very rarely this can lead to cardiac arrest. There can be an interaction between fluoxetine and clozapine increasing the levels of clozapine. Infection also may increase the level of clozapine. An ECG is done before starting clozapine to see if she already has a long QT, this can run in families. Infection like COVID can alter this interval as well as vomiting / electrolyte disturbance (if she had this), as well as weed/THC, as well as eating disorders (though you say she has recovered from this a long time ago). She would likely have had a lot of ECGs done in the past however, and it is a rare medication side effect. Prolonged QT can cause weakness, faintness, and palpitations. \n\nThis is one clozapine guideline from my country: \nhttps://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/059961804298b3078c77be80c298878e/Clozapine+Management+Clinical+Guideline+_2.0_final.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE-059961804298b3078c77be80c298878e-p4gHBB2\n\nThere have been several news stories about deaths / inquests linked to clozapine that I\u2019ve seen, though these evens are rare. It also does appear to be the case that it can be very effective, and is under-utilised for treatment resistant schizophrenia, and can work where other medications have not. \n\nI hope that you have good support around you for your grief.",

Clozapine is associated with NMS presenting atypically and without an autopsy this would be impossible to know, even with one it would likely be difficult. \n\nKnowing clozapine dose would be most helpful. As well as name and doses of other medications she was on.  Clozapine and fluoxetine do interact in a manner that increases clozapine levels but at a starting dose of clozapine (12.5-25mg) this shouldn\u2019t be deadly in such a short time. \n\nBased on her prior intolerance of medications, she maybe was a poor metabolizer of medication secondary liver enzyme activity, likely CYP3A4 and/or 2C19.  Additionally, because of estrogen levels, women have lower activity of CYP1A2, the primary enzyme responsible for metabolizing clozapine. If she is of Asian heritage, that would also be associated to low CYP1A2 activity. Fever/illness also reduces CYP1A2 activity. So there could be multiple factors that would have predisposed her to higher clozapine levels. \n\nBased on her side effects, I am a bit worried she may have been started on a higher dose of clozapine than 12.5-25mg so this information would help. \n\nWithout prior exposure to clozapine it would be very, very unlikely to develop myocarditis so early in treatment, 80-90% of cases are in weeks 2-4. \n\nAgranulocytosis would also take much longer than several days, even with prior clozapine exposure and history of agranulocytosis. \n\nI think most likely cause would be undiagnosed cardiac condition exacerbated by autonomic side effects of clozapine or seizure, especially if given a higher than recommended starting dose.",

She has been vaccinated for COVID, and her cold was likely a common cold as our eldest and I also had it, and we all recovered around the same time. Thank you for such a\u00a0thoughtful response. We have since adopted a cat, and I feed the pigeons she liked to feed so much.\n\n\n\n\nEdit:I forgot to mention, while her ED was resolved, she was doing Intermittent Fasting. 6/18 eating window, with the occasional OMAD",

It is not a first line treatment. Most people will have tried multiple other meds before clozapine is tried. In addition to the blood draws, it also needs to be taken extremely consistently. Missing more than 2 days of doses in a row generally means the med needs to be restarted at a low dose and slowly increased back up due to the risk of orthostatic hypotension. It also has a bunch of other potential side effects like drooling, sedation, and significant weight gain. \n\n\nAll that being said, it is a life changing medication. It is the only medication that has FDA approval for decreasing suicide risk in schizophrenia. It can treat psychosis symptoms in people that have not had success with other meds, even multiple meds at a time. \n\nWe have ways to decrease the risk of side effects. The most important two are the frequent lab monitoring and starting at very low doses and increasing slowly.",

        "comment": "There are lots of different reasons a troponin can be elevated. It could be that your elevated troponin has nothing to do with Clozapine. A common cause is viral infections. If we measured the troponin of lots of people, a few who are not on Clozapine would have a troponin around yours without any symptoms and without it being problematic.\n\nHowever Clozapine does carry a risk of causing myocarditis, especially early in treatment. This is why we monitor it so closely. Having a troponin at that level so early in treatment is certainly concerning.\n\nSome people do retrial Clozapine however you would have to wait for your troponin to return to the normal range. If I was doing this, however, I would first get a second opinion from a cardiologist. In my country there are cardiologists employed by the Clozapine companies who provide excellent advice. I'm not sure whether this is possible in your country? Be cautious with a cardiologist who has no experience with Clozapine because they may be inexperienced in its prescription and simply say \"never try again\" to be safe.",

Does anyone have experience with the Invega Sustenna 50 mg injection? Was it enough? Did you relapse into psychosis? Did it help with side effects like weight gain, anhedonia(no/ numbed emotions), oculogyric crisis, no sex drive, high prolactin levels and lactation, no menstruation? These are all my side effects. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks!",

Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. **Role of Dopamine in Consciousness**: Studies with dopamine-deficient mice suggest that dopamine signaling is crucial for the expression of consciousness. Dopamine-deficient mice exhibit deficits in attention, learning, memory, and motivation, despite being awake and responsive to stimuli. Restoration of dopamine signaling restores most behaviors, indicating the importance of dopamine in maintaining consciousness.\n2. **Association Between Dopamine and Spirituality**: The paper discusses the relationship between dopamine and spiritual experiences, particularly during meditation. PET studies show a significant increase in dopamine release during meditation practices such as Yoga Nidra. This suggests that dopamine plays a role in the neurochemical processes underlying spiritual practices and experiences.\n3. **Impact of Dopamine on Religiosity**: There is a proposed link between dopamine function, specifically within the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), and religiosity. Hypoactivity of the medial PFC may result in decreased religiosity, characterized by reckless behavior, self-indulgence, and impaired theory of mind. Conversely, hyperactivity of the medial PFC may lead to heightened religiosity, marked by rigid conformity, excessive self-concern, and overinterpretation of others' thoughts.\n4. **Potential Psychotic Effects of Dopamine Modulation**: The paper suggests that dopamine modulation, along with other neurochemical changes induced by meditation, can lead to psychotic states. Increased dopamine, along with other neurotransmitters like serotonin and DMT, may contribute to schizophrenomimetic effects and psychotic-like experiences during meditation.\n\nIn summary, the evidence presented supports the idea that dopamine levels can influence self-awareness, conscious experience, and spirituality. Changes in dopamine function may impact cognitive processes, emotional regulation, and perception, ultimately affecting one's sense of self and spiritual experiences.  \n\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nReference:  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4737196/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4737196/)\n\n>  \nDopamine improved the prediction by subjective awareness of objective  performance in an online task with minimal self\u2010awareness (noetic  metacognition). Dopamine also enhanced extended self\u2010awareness with  introspection (autonoetic metacognition) concomitant with stimulation of  the anterior cingulate/prefrontal cortex, a process which seems to be  tightly linked to incentive stimulation and reward\n\n  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839810/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839810/)\n\n>  \nThe neural correlates of consciousness are largely unknown but many neural circuits are likely to be involved. Our experiments with mice  that cannot synthesize dopamine suggest that dopamine signaling is a  critical component necessary for the expression of consciousness.  Although dopamine-deficient mice are awake and respond to many stimuli,  they are unmotivated and have profound deficits in all but the simplest  learning tasks. Dopamine-deficient mice are unable to attend to salient  sensory information, integrate it with prior experience, store it in  long-term memory, or choose appropriate actions. While clearly conscious  from a general anesthetic point of view, dopamine-deficient mice have  marginal arousal and appear to be virtually unconscious from a  behavioral point of view. Restoration of dopamine signaling within the  striatum by viral gene therapy strategies restores most behaviors.  Therefore, I propose that dopaminergic modulation of glutamatergic  inputs from the cortex and thalamus onto medium spiny neurons in the  striatum contributes to cognition and the expression of consciousness.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190564/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190564/)\n\n>  \nThe role of spirituality as a resource for finding meaning and hope in suffering has also been identified as a key component in the process of psychological recovery. Most studies have shown that religious  involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes,  including greater longevity, coping skills and health-related quality  of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression and  suicide  \n\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>A study conducted on students in a large metropolitan area showed that  religious factors were strongly associated with lower drug abuse, even  after controlling for the relevant socio-demographic and educational  variables.  The role of spirituality in addiction was also reflected upon in a  study, which found that smoking and frequent binge drinking were  negatively correlated with spirituality scores  \n\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Most of the studies examining them used functional imaging as the  investigation tool, to delineate the neural mechanisms involved in these  practices. They include the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies  on Yoga, Tantric Yoga and Yoga Nidra; the Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (MRI) study on Kundalini Yoga; and the Single Photon Emission  Computerized Tomography (SPECT) study on Tibetan meditation. The studies  point to prefrontal activation, transient hypofrontality, increased  frontal lobe and decreased parietal lobe activity and also to a  deafferentation of the posterior superior parietal lobule (PSPL) in  spirituality  \n\\[...\\]  \nThere is substantial evidence from the psychology of religion to  suggest that people are prepared \u2018for religious experiences and this  readiness\u2019 is probably mediated by the dorsomedial frontal cortex,  leading to the commonly reported felt immediacy of religious experience.  The experience, however, becomes religious when people consciously  identify the experience as consistent with their own religious schema.  This cognitive process most probably involves the dorsolateral,  prefrontal and medial parietal cortex. Therefore, the prefrontal regions  mediate both the preparedness of religious experience and conscious  cognitive process involved in the appreciation of religious experience  \n\\[...\\]  \nFurther, it is proposed that a balanced function of the medial PFC is  needed to maintain balanced religious activities. The specific functions  involved in this regulation of religion are those mediating compliance  to rules and customs, self-reflection and the understanding of thoughts  and feelings of others with compassion and empathy (theory of mind).  Theory of mind (ToM) or mentalization is the ability to recognize that  someone else has a mind different from one's own. It involves the  ability to infer someone else's mind by facial expression, tone of voice  and non-verbal communication.  \n\\[...\\]  \nThe medial PFC is involved in error detection and monitoring and  compliance to social norms and therefore is involved in mediating  compliance to rules and customs. The medial PFC along with the posterior  cingulate is involved in self-reflective thought and this helps the  person to have an insight into his own experience and the perception of  self in relation to the divine being. The third regulatory function,  which includes the theory of mind, involves the medial PFC, especially  the orbitofrontal cortex, the lesion of which impairs theory of mind  tasks. Based on this it is hypothesized that the hypofunction of the  medial PFC results in decreased religiosity (hyporeligiosity). This  would result from a combination of reckless and lawless behaviour  (impaired error detection), self-indulgence (loss of self reflection)  and an inability to consider the thoughts of others (impaired theory of  mind). Hyperfunction of the medial PFC, on the other hand, will lead to  rigid conformity with rules and customs, excessive concern over oneself  and one's existence and excessive interpretation of the mind of others,  all of which results in heightened religiosity (hyperreligiosity)  \n\\[...\\]  \nThe dopaminergic system, via the basal ganglia, is involved in cortical  subcortical interactions and a PET study on the dopaminergic tone in  Yoga Nidra using 11 C-raclopride showed significant increase of dopamine  during meditation.  During meditation, 11C-raclopride binding in ventral striatum decreased  by 7.9%. This corresponds to a 65% increase in endogenous dopamine  release  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \nMeditation can induce psychotic states via mechanism such as increased 5HT2  receptor activation, increased DMT, increased NAAG and increased  dopamine. The mechanisms include the 5HT inhibition of LGB, the  hallucinogenic effects of DMT, the dissociative hallucinogenic effects  of NAAG and the action of increased dopamine in the temporal lobe. A  variety of schizophrenomimetic effects can be seen as a result of these  complex neurochemical changes.\n\n&#x200B;",

Have tried it once or twice since, but I am only a stoner at heart now because it really does worsen symptoms. Fast forward to 25 I've found the antipsychotics that work for me, paired with antidepressants - I can function!

I am now at the second lowest and I'm still able to function without many/any symptoms. \n\nI want kids in the future and when asking my healthcare provider about medication and pregnancy they suggested I stay on meds for life, even when I have a kid. This doesn't sit well with me because of some research I've done about antipsychotics and pregnancy, with the little info there is I've learned the outcomes aren't favorable. It's my understanding that when the baby is born it's side effects from the mothers meds will be 100x that of what the mother would experience. Plus withdraws after being born. So I don't want to stay on meds as reccomended because of the side effects my baby would have. It is terrifying to think of being in psychosis while pregnant. \n\nSo what are some coping skills I should work on? How do I make a game plan with my partner for proper support? What professional help should I look for - doula, midwife, supportive doctor, therapy? I'd like to hear your experience if you've gone through this and what helped you along. \n\nHow can I handle psychosis easier when I'm pregnant? -off meds",

        "text": "I  have a brother with schizophrenia. He came to live with me after our dad died. He was \"okay\" for the most part the first few years, I wasn't even sure what his exact diagnosis was, besides the fact that he was severe OCD and social anxiety to the point of it being crippling for him. He had a lot of trouble sleeping, paced and peeked out windows a lot, couldn't do anything without giving him plenty of advance notice (ie: 'wanna go to McDonalds?'  he couldn't just say ok and jump in the car; he needs at least an hour to think about it and decide if he can do it or wants to do it). Lots and lots and lots of \"quirks\" I called them. He was pissing in bottles in his room, even though he had his own bathroom literally two feet outside his bedroom door. He would also do things like check the mail, multliple times a day, even after he watched the mailman come and brought the mail in. If I would occasionally say \"hey, you already brought the mail in today?\" He would just say \"I know\", like he couldn't help it. A lot of the things he does that don't really make sense, he seems to have the attitude that he knows but can't help himself.  Which I totally don't give him a hard time about, I mean so what if he checks the mail five times, right?\n\nAnyway last year he had a major episode, hearing voices, specifically our dead dad threatening him.  Voices started in the house and then he would hear them outside, coming thru telephone poles, etc.  He then became afraid that our second story was going to collapse and wouldn't come into the house (but we ended up getting him a motel room because it was FREEZING outside, and he lasted a few hours there before he ran out of there too). So it took me almost 2 weeks to get him Baker acted through the court, he was living in the Burger King parking lot and would run into the woods any time a family member would approach him. He tends to go back to things that are 'comforting' to him (at least that's MY opinion); we had a Burger King in our town growing up that he would sit at for hours, every time he runs away from the house he goes straight to a Burger King. Lately he has been watching The Wizard of Oz EVERY SINGLE DAY without fail.  Over a month now, he starts it at whatever time it is that makes it end at 9:38, because he goes to bed at exactly 9:38 every night.  The hospital ended up taking him to court to keep him longer than the 3 days. He was finally diagnosed properly (he HATES doctors, meds, won't even take a Tylenol for a headache) and he had schizophrenia with extreme paranoia and was put on the 2 month injections of aristada.\n\nSo he seemed like his 'old' self for about 8 months.  It did not stop any of his 'quirks'.  He still will not go on the balcony.  Alexa freaks him out.  He wears 3 shirts and a winter coat in 80 degree weather.  So all that is the same, but at least he wasn't running out of my house and living in a parking lot.\n\nSo about a week before Christmas, he ran out and went to Burger King.  Ended up calling my adult son to meet him there, and when my son kept asking him what's going on?  Are you okay?  He just kept saying \"I don't know.  I don't know.\"  They went up to order some food and when the food was ready he ran out of Burger King and into the woods.  My son finally got him to come out and he just kept saying he didn't know what he wanted, didn't know what was wrong, didn't know what he wanted to do.  It *seemed* to me like the meds were at least 'fighting' somewhat his impulse to stay in the woods and not come home.\n\nHe has asked me on occasion to 'hide all the knives in the house', I don't know if he means to harm himself or me/my husband.  I do *everything* for him, from his laundry to serving his meals with fork and napkin, because if I don't give him a fork he won't get one?  Some family members say I baby him, but I have left him to his own devices and he seriously can't seem to put together a pb&j.  He will just eat like little debbies if husband and I go on vacation for a few days, even though I have stocked the fridge.  I have read up on schizophrenia and I feel like his voices are making him freeze up to the point of he can't grab a fork out of the drawer in front of us.  This latest episode has me scared the meds are wearing off/not strong enough?  His doctors won't talk to me bc of HIPPA laws and there are NO support groups or NAMI groups in my county.  Our county Legal Aid said they don't do getting me assigned as his medical guardian, and that it would be $7k for me to get a lawyer (not happening).\n\nHe will NOT talk to me or the doctors about anything.  When I was his legal medical guardian while he was hospitalized the docs all told me he sits there and won't answer questions, or says I don't know and refuses to cooperate.  It's all a big guessing game for me as I try and cobble information together from the internet.\n\nAre there any online support groups for family/caregivers?  Can Aristada lose its effectiveness after 8 months?  SORRY FOR THE BOOK.   \n\nHope everyone is having a nice Tuesday so far.",

I'm constantly looking at the time to see if the time has passed by significantly, and it feels like the time goes by rather slowly. I've noticed that I require something exciting and stimulating to keep my boredom off the board. In addition, it's gotten more difficult to start on an activity?? I don't know if it's because my mind think it's going to be boring or something but I can't seem to start on any activities. If Aripiprazole is causing this, how long will it take for this \"boredom/feeling/anhedonia\" to subside?",

I refused to let them have control and I found ways to belittle it as if it was a child because the voices really came off like someone who was 40 years old but with an 8th grade education.  Our fights got so severe that it eventually demanded that I get an exorcism to oust the voice.  So, since I was in St. Louis, I went to the church that was involved in the original exorcism that is featured in the movie The Exorcist.  But, the exorcism didn't happen, I got a healing spell instead, and we continued to bitch and fight with each other.  Read that to your friend and let them know to never give in to the voices, it's their body and mind and you just need to will yourself to have the stronger presence of force in your mind.  And meds.  I had to go through a few different meds until I leveled out and no longer had the voices.  As for a poem?  Here's one of mine - it kinda looks like a bird\n\n  \nChartula alacanthis (paper birds)\n\n  \nIn and out\n\nand all about they go\n\nwhen their time is done\n\nthey are gone\n\nlike everything else\n\n  \nStay well my friend!",

I also passed on your advice about the voices and being the stronger presence.\n\nWhen we talked yesterday, he talked at length about the benevolent voices and how intelligent they were, \"mind-blowingly, so\". I told him that I ascribe the intelligence of those voices to the fact that they are his voice and his intelligence, which is far superior to most of the intelligent people I know.\n\nWithout exaggeration, his IQ has to be off the charts, even taking into consideration \"scatter\" where there are measures of superiority and offsetting deficiencies. His uncle (now deceased) had an IQ in the 150s; I recall his mother having an IQ of 146. This LO could dance circles around either one of them. Words are not sufficient to express the complexity of the human mind and the various aberrations that can arise when the brain doesn't quite function as one would want it to.",

Hoping a lowered dose again to 50 mg helps the weight gain, emotional numbness, no sex drive, no creativity/motivation, and memory problems.",

I'm still numb which sucks and is like torture but it's not like a sinking pit of depression in my chest feeling. It's more like neutral grinding mundane okayness. And my eyes are basically fine now. Not many instances of oculogyric crisis unless I'm reading a lot at night. Stress doesn't even affect it like that anymore and it's not so random. And I'm not so socially awkward and can focus and memorize better. Everything else is still going in though so not everything is as torturous if given the right adjustment but they can definitely come up with something better for the drug. Hope you found a better medium place to be too. Best of luck on this wild journey.",

His main concerns at that time are mood swings, and he finds his attention is waining. He is 30 y/o with normal renal function and works in a trade with a lot of physical labor, which makes me think he is likely to clear the medication quicker than the typical patient. There is some substance use as well (methamphetamine) that we are trying to manage as well. He says he only uses when the injection is wearing off.We were thinking of cutting down the interval to q14 or q18 days. I can't find any literatue on this. Does anyone have experience with shorter intervals?\n\nNote - in Canada here we only have the Maintena, not the Asimtufi\n\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone who responded. We ended up starting Epival. We don't have the Aristada in Canada, or I would have suggested that. I think this patient may be a hypermetaboliser or it may be the meth use that is limiting the effectiveness of the Abilify Maintena. Another factor is we're getting a compassionate supply, so the manufactuer would likely balk at providing that many more free injections. ",

        "text": "Hi everyone. Apologies in advance, this post might be a bit long, but I feel like setting up the scene is at least a little relevant.\n\n>Content Warning: ED mention\n\nI started coping with depression when I was like, twelve or thirteen? I basically masked it for most of my life, and was very VERY antimedication (for myself, didn\u2019t care if others took meds) until I basically reached a boiling point of \u201cok I can\u2019t do this by myself\u201d\n\nIn 2020 (when I was nineteen) I started on my first antidepressant; which was escitalopram (lexapro/cipralax). The medication wasn\u2019t doing anything for my mental health, so I was given an antipsychotic mood stabilizer called ariprazole (abilify/aristada.) Once again, no change.\n\nSlowly I just kinda stopped taking the meds, but eventually I went to my doctor in 2022 and got started on zoloft (sertraline) + ariprazole. Once again, I noticed nothing from these guys.\n\nApparently I didn\u2019t write down my starting date- oopsies- somewhere within early 2023 I went back to my doctors and they started me on duloxetine (cymbalta). I\u2019m still taking it, and although I haven\u2019t noticed anything mental health wise, the duloxetine at least has SOME effect on my body because if I take the medication without eating a full meal I get incredibly nauseated. >!Because of having an eating disorder I have a hard time eating enough before taking the meds however,!< so the past couple days I\u2019ve just been beat down with nausea for multiple hours. \n\nI\u2019m kind of just fed up at this point. I keep having very antimedication thoughts; thinking about quitting antidepressants all together bc this isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s been extremely frustrating, finally cracking my shell and accepting that I need help only for the help I\u2019ve received to have absolutely zero effect.

        "text": "What are your views on this scary story from the below user. She describes Abilify as dangerous and the cause of many extreme impulsive behaviours, as well as serious weight gain. She also provides links at the bottom - the lawsuits against it and a survivors guide website that explains the dangers of the drug and how prescribers are unaware of how potentially bad this drug is as the pharmaceutical company brushes it under the carpet.\n\nI\u2019ve been prescribed this drug and it\u2019s baffling that if it\u2019s so dangerous then why is it still on the market? \n\nI need reassurance here. \n\n\nKatieKat1342\n\nI posted this on another group, but I\u2019m sharing my experience with abilify to warn others about it.\n\nI know this is an unpopular opinion, and I hate to be the downer of the thread, but abilify absolutely destroyed years of my life. I\u2019m 19 years old, diagnosed with BPD, depression, anxiety, as well as psychosis episodes over the past few years. I was originally put on abilify to help me gain weight for anorexia, as the eating disorder clinic puts all their patients on it to gain weight. It was the worse mistake of my life not pushing back against taking it.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, abilify helped me short term. It got rid of the ruminative thoughts I had and helped me to eat. But then I started eating a lot, multiple times a day, totally out of control eating. And then I started spending a lot of money that I didn\u2019t have. Multiple amazon packages per day, $1,500 in debt in one month. What might be the worse part is that I turned into a total nymphomaniac. I was 17 and having sexual with random guys that I barely knew. This nymphomaniacal behaviour was the reason I was sex trafficked. And also, poriomania. The impulsive tendency to journey, wander, or run away from home. At 18, I had run away from home over 5 times for a period of a month at a time just because I \u201cfeel I needed to\u201d. There was no cause for this. I attributed all these weird impulsive behaviours to my BPD.\n\nAnd then last week, I found out something terrible. For 3 years, I\u2019ve been on this drug, and never knew that there was a HUGE lawsuit against the makers of abilify; Bristol Myers Squibb. This company hid for years, since the 1990\u2019s and only recently were found about about. Abilify causes the very behaviours I was taking it for. Impulse control disorders were reported by thousands who had suddenly had the urge to gamble away $600,000 of their money on a whim. Some of them did just that. Others ate themselves almost to death from impulsive eating. Some became extremely hyper sexual and caught very serious STD\u2019s. I will post links below.\n\nThis drug is not good AT ALL! Nor is the company that makes it. They\u2019ve had their offices stormed by the FBI, had to pay 535 million dollars in settlements (so far), and worse of all, it\u2019s a dangerous drug to get off of. I\u2019ve been 4 days off of it and am having terrible, horrific side effects. These side effects are hidden by the FDA, but there is something called abilify (aripirasol) poisoning. You get severe stomach pain, sensitivity to light, diarrhea, vomiting, and even suicidal thoughts.\n\nAt one point, BMS put on their website that the best way to get off the drug is to do it cold turkey. A little while later, after thousands had done just that, they developed the drug AbilifyMyCite, which is marketed to ALL USERS (not just people who are non-compliant with taking medications). It has a sensor in it that tracks when and if you took the abilify pill. This leads me and many others to believe that the company realized just how dangerous it is to get off this drug, and developed another equally dangerous drug to make sure people are taking their meds and not coming off it cold turkey. It can cause extreme bodily harm and organ failure from withdrawing from it.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to scare you in any way, but you must weigh the risk vs benefits of being on a drug like this. I am on my fourth try getting off this medication, after I developed dystonia in my left leg (uncontrollable muscle contractions). It is most likely irreversible and I need to take medications to make it stop contracting.\n\nI am so sorry for being a downer, but this drug is really not good in any way. It helps for a bit, but is so bad for the body. Definitely do your research on all antipsychotics and medications in general before taking them.\n\nStay safe, and let me know if you have any other questions\u201d\n\nHere are the links - https://www.drugwatch.com/abilify/side-effects/\n\nhttps://time.com/4317182/abilify-aristada-aripiprazole-sex-gambling/\n\nhttps://www.drugwatch.com/abilify/lawsuits/\n\nhttps://www.consumersafety.org/drug-lawsuits/abilify/\n\nhttps://abilifysurvivorsguide.com",

He has spiraled into an anxious depressed mess when school abruptly stopped.  We were overjoyed that first week!\n\nThen he started getting so very upset if you looked at him wrong or he perceived the slightest criticism. It was back to I\u2019m so stupid, I\u2019m so dumb, I deserve to be hurt.  It was heartbreaking in ways I cannot describe.  When he got upset he would go away and scratch himself as hard as he could to to cause as much pain as he could.  He kept saying he couldn\u2019t stop, I\u2019d hold his hands trying to stop him and he\u2019d writhe and fight me to try to scratch like it was a compulsion he could not control.\n\nHe\u2019s off abilify now, but it was a terrible two months.  When we brought up our concerns his psych increased the dose.  He has a new psych and seems to do better on a snri (so far).\n\nI took 2mg Abilify briefly as an adjunct to a SSRI.  I have never ever been able to concentrate so well as when I was taking Abilify. But I could not stop eating.  20 pounds later I went off it.  But I do miss being able to focus.\n\nI know my son\u2019s first psych saw it as a miracle drug of sorts - able to deliver just enough dopamine just where it was needed.  His second psych even said it would be in her short list for him.  \n\nWell we also saw the side effects.  Also, my son\u2019s first psych swore in low dosages abilify was terrible and dangerous - likely to cause mania - and needed higher dosages to stabilize patients.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to believe, but I never want to go near that drug again.",

Long term mortality rates are not affected by antipsychotic use - thats in a major recent study on pubmed. Whittaker wants to sell his book so picks an alarmist angle. Do you really think that if these claims of harm were true, the oversight of medical and health authorities wouldn\u2019t raise such concerns with the public. Just more conspiracy thinking and outright misinterpretation of the data. Correlation is not causation and Whittaker\u2019s example of disability numbers going up in lockstep with antidepressant use is totally deluded. Psychiatric drugs are of immense help and mental illness is very real. Without these drugs we can be very unwell and disabled due to persistent mental illness. The truth is they treat real biological based brain disorders. There is room for improvement sure with more exact molecular targets and less metabolic side effects for example but this will happen with the advance of medicine.",

I also have lost pleasure in doing most leisure activities, where I start an activity for 5 minutes and then quit to try something else. I get easily bored of life but I don't feel suicidal. \n\nHow do I get my affect back? I don't want to take the next Aristada dose if I'll end up feeling like this.",

He just saw his doctor, she's like 70 and she prescribed him a first generation antipsychotic! \nAfter they didn't taper and ceased the seroquel all at once, he's been sick in bed for about 2 weeks. \nI think the dosages he gets are quite high. All he does that I see from him is he complains about witchcraft and every once in a while thinks people are out to get him. But he's a native and in the culture there are spirits and other stuff that he feels has been upon him. \nMy friend is about 5'9\" 200lb 55 years old and is from the native reservation. \nI told him he has to advocate for himself and communicate clearly. He does so quite well with me but idk about with his doctor. He has walked away from his Dr multiple times because they didn't listen to him. \nWhat can I tell him to advocate for himself. He lays in bed alll day and since he got the prolixin he can't even wake up in the morning like he used to.",

I will be eating something and suddenly I\u2019ll just start gagging. Some foods are better than others, but no food is actually safe. It\u2019s getting to the point that the thought of food makes me sick and I don\u2019t want to eat. Literally all I had to eat yesterday was an apple. I\u2019ve seen my PCP, but all she did was give me meds for indigestion, which haven\u2019t helped. \nDetails on me: I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d. I don\u2019t smoke, but I do vape. I have no major medical history, apart from having my appendix out and a POTS diagnosis. I do have a genetic mutation (Norwegian founders) that gives me a higher chance of pancreatic, colon, and breast cancer. My mother died of pancreatic cancer a few years ago. I have a bipolar 2 diagnosis and take numerous medications (Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Naltrexone [I just started this one], Aristada, and oxycarbazpine).\nIf anyone has any ideas of what to do or what to talk to my doctor about, I would greatly appreciate that.

        "text": "My father has been admitted to the hospital for his sudden change in behaviour. He was acting hysterical and delirious earlier today and we immediately called an ambulance for him. (He is a previous stroke victim and we do not take any chances with changes in his health what so ever)\n\nHe is over 60 and on Citalopram 40mg/day (Celexa) for the past two years an anti-depressant. The symptoms today included disorientation, a race for thoughts, jumping from one topic to the next in no specific order or relevance, while indicating thoughts of paranoia and obvious hyperactivity in movement and thought. Or in other words delirium.\n\nI was flustered with stress/pressure of the situation and in the heat of the moment agreed with the doctor to take him off citalopram for the night and give him Haloperidol 10mg/day (Haldol) and Lorazepam (Ativan) 2mg/day to sedate him. The doctor had no medical evidence but diagnosed my father with double (over) dosing on citalopram due to the symptoms and indicated not to give him any more citalopram. I agreed.\n\nThe doctor was a young fella and I really didn't think at the moment to research or look up the drug. After researching many reputable websites, each states that the use of Haloperidol (Haldol) has serious fatal side effects for individuals experiencing Dementia.\n\nI'm very upset at the ER's reasoning to prescribe this given my father's medical history and symptoms today for even suggesting a drug that is known to have fatal side effects. I think the public healthcare hospitals are overcrowded and significantly understaffed. The doctor himself was a young individual and flustered running around the ER at 1AM. but that still shouldn't have been a reason for him to prescribe it without indicating the obvious fatal side effect. \n\nThis is not my first direct horror story with public healthcare nor will it most likely be the last. I have many friends that complain similar to me regarding wait times, treatment and care, and what not within the public healthcare. For clarity I am in Ontario, Canada - and if you live here and need an MRI, you also know what I mean. By what I mean is if you urgently need an MRI next day, you drive down to the US and pay for it, instead of waiting 3-4 months. There are a broad array of issues as you can see. \n\nAnyone have similar stories and your take on the question?\n\nI'm not asking medical advice, just sharing my experience/story. \n\nTL;DR 60 year old man experiencing delirium state of mind prescribed anti-depressant drug fatal only to adults",

        "text": "My brother is going through some mental health problems, maybe you guys would have some insight as to what the problem may be.\n\nLast fall my brother was under a lot of stress, stemming from finals and girl problems. It all started when after midterms he got his his mid semester grades back and realized his GPA was on track to drop below a 2.0. He started staying up until 5 AM quite regularly, probably averaging  about 3-4 hours of sleep per night for the last half of the semester. He managed to bring his grades around, and did decent on his final exams.\n\nThe week after exams ended my brother and I went on a skiing trip along with a few friends. When we arrived at our destination one friend called and said she was very sick and wouldn't be able to make it. My brother has had a thing for this particular girl, and when he heard she wouldn't be making he just seemed to pop. He started laying on the couch with a black expression on his face, just staring at the wall, non responsive to inquiries. Every few hours he would have an \"attack\". He has since described what was going on in his head. His thoughts would be going a thousand miles a minute, so fast he was unable to grasp one thought before it slipped away and another replaced it. He likened it to a slide show being played at full speed. A sequence of events, memories replayed over and over in his mind, for no apparent reason. He felt terrified, looking for an answer to a question he didn't know. He was having full blown psychotic episodes, suffering from delusions and thought disorder. The episodes were so strong he was unable to comprehend his surroundings, unable to see more than a few feet in front of himself. At this point I realized something was seriously wrong and brought him to the emergency room. The doctor gave him Haloperidol to slow his thoughts down, halting his body tremors and forcing him to sleep.\n\nHe was in the hospital for 10 days, and still no concrete diagnosis.\n\nHe continues to suffer from thought disorder and minor delusions.\n\nMy family has a history of mental illness. My father has schizophrenia and anxiety attacks, my mom schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The doctor ruled out schizophrenia, but bipolar is still on the table.\n",

It can take several attempts before you find one that works. Give any new drug 2 months before you scratch it off the list because it can take time to reach full strength in your blood and most side effects will wane after several weeks. If after two months you still have crappy side effects and/or you just don't feel it's working for you then try the next one on your list.  \n\n\nI highly recommend keeping a journal. It doesn't have to be a daily thing but keeping track of what drugs you tried, what dosage and what positive and negative effects you self-observed over the two months of taking it can be really helpful.",

She was also noted to have disorganized behavior (in a religious theme) as well as anger outbursts. This change in behavior was noted following some stressful incidents at her husband's home (problems with her in-laws). She was previously admitted under psychiatry in December 2020 with similar complaints and was treated for dissociative disorder. She was discharged on Sertraline 50mg and Olanzapine 5mg and also underwent psychotherapy sessions with Ms. Suha. Symptoms recurred after her medications were discontinued on 08.01.2021 (due to improvement of symptoms).\n\nExamination General:\n- BP 130/52 mmHg\n- Chest B/L clear\n- PR 98/min\n- RR 18/min\n\nNSE (positive findings at the time of admission):\n- Appropriately dressed\n- Appeared restless, distressed\n- Poor eye contact\u2014kept her eyes closed during the interview\n- Unable to engage in conversation with her\n- Incoherent speech (reciting verses of the Qur'an)\n- Unable to assess thoughts, perception\n\nInvestigations: All enclosed.\n\nTreatment and Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted under the Department of Psychiatry in an isolation ward and started on Olanzapine, Sertraline, Sodium Valproate, and Lorazepam, in addition to SOS injections of Haloperidol, Phenergan, and Diazepam. Sodium Valproate was withheld during the admission, and she was started on Carbamazepine.\n\nProgress during Hospital Stay:\nSymptoms such as anger outbursts, disrupted sleep, disorganized behavior, and irrelevant speech resolved during the admission. She was observed to have labile mood as well as a slightly elevated mood. However, there were no overt psychotic features and no symptoms suggestive of mania. The patient was cooperative with her medications and ward routines. No aggressive or disorganized behavior was present at the time of discharge.\n\nAdvice at Discharge:\n- T.

I was actually in the process of being weaned off of Ativan bc it has the opposite effect on me (it doesn\u2019t relax me at all, it just makes me sad and anxious) when i woke up my first day, i felt a little homesick and anxious. I went up to the nurses desk and told my nurse how i felt. I honestly just needed someone to sit down with me and tell me everything was going to be okay, but instead, he handed me an antipsychotic (haldol) and the rest of the day i felt SO weird. I don\u2019t even know how to explain it, but it definitely made my anxiety skyrocket. The next day, i woke up and ate breakfast with some of the others. I noticed my neck muscles started to seize up. I was so scared i didnt know what was going on but i tried to move my head back into its original position but it kept going back. So long story short, a nurse brings me to the nurses desk, they explained that its a side effect of haldol and they shoot me full of Benadryl to cancel out the effects. Luckily it got rid of it but also wtf. After that i lost all trust in the staff. My body kinda went into survival mode for the rest of the time i was there. i was SO anxious everyday just waiting to get out. I realized the quickest way out was to put a smile on my face and pretended like i was happy and fine. Most people there were there for anxiety, and these \u201cprofessionals\u201d didnt even know how to talk to people with it! The psychiatrist preached about \u201ccoping skills\u201d over and over but when i ask about my discharge she\u2019d be vague. Even the day before my discharge i asked \u201cwhens my discharge\u201d and she said \u201cif things go according to plan then tomorrow\u201d like ????

        "text": "Good evening all,\n\nI'm writing this on behalf of a friend who contacted me recently and does not have internet beyond whatsapp and doesn't have access to Reddit. I'm writing this in case anyone knows what to do in this situation which I regretfully can't do much in since I'm outside the country (he's in Lebanon, I'm in France). If anyone can seriously help, contact me and I'll provide you with more details.\n\nTo protect him, I won't mention his name but am going to explain his situation based on what he told me:\n\n* His family life, from what he told me, is toxic. It's been that way since his adolescent years (he's now in his mid-twenties) to the point where he only ever felt at home when we were at school.\n* He fled his house in Beirut and went to a family-owned house they have in the mountains where there's no electricity.\n* He has no sustainable income and despairs at finding a job because the economic situation is extremely dire.\n* He's extremely constipated and stressed.\n* His current and most pressing issue is his mental state:\n   * He's taking several drugs as medication (I have the list of the doses but in summary, he's taking Haloperidol, Olanzapine, Xalipro, Prometal, Rivotril, Abilify maintena).\n   * He's extremely distrustful of everyone.\n   * He believes there's a conspiracy surrounding him. This is due to him believing there is a machine implanted in his left lung (he felt something moving apparently a while ago) and when asking his mother, doctors, doing a CT-scan at the AUB hospital and consulting the doctors there, they apparently all told him the machine isn't there and he told me this means they believe him to be delusional. He even believes they're all lying to him and changing the test results.\n   * This machine (which in my opinion as a pharmacist and someone who dabbled medical implants a bit, is fictional) is causing him stress because he believes something might happen to him from it --> he's extremely paranoid about it.\n   * All of this is pretty much killing his social and professional life. He told me he's been pushed a lot at his last job to the point where he couldn't speak sometimes.\n* He says he contacted some NGO and they didn't help him.\n\nMy personal analysis of everything was this: I have not enough knowledge on his family life so I can't provide help there, but what I can do is give him some advice on everything else. For his constipation, drink a cup of warm water before anything else in the morning + eat lots of fibers through vegetables (buy small quantities as there's no refrigeration at home). For his mental state, his main job is going to be hard, but he'll need to force himself to tackle one issue at the time while putting aside things he can't do anything about (like the \"machine\"). That means his main current mission will be to keep himself healthy.\n\nI theorize that there's no machine or conspiracy, but that the guy has been driven into a state of paranoia where any small thing can make him overthink the issues he has. Th issue is that he's likely to assume any doctors or professionals that could diagnose him are lying or are \"in on the conspiracy\".\n\nWhat do you propose to do in this case?\n\nThanks in any case for anyone who can help.",

        "text": "Hello!\n\n I have stumbled upon these very familiar to me posts, going like \"Nothing is real\".\n\nIn my case I have those derealisation episodes sometimes, but I DO know what causes them and how to stop them.\n\nLong story Short:\n\n Check if you are taking any medicinal pills or supplements, especially neuroleptics, their side effects could be the reason you feel \"nothing is real\".\n\nLong Story:\n\nWhen I was 15 I started having problems at school that made me attend school classes less. I neved had any hallucinations, psychosis or any other stuff, all I did was not going to school sometimes. My parents were strict about it, didn't want to help me fix my problems in school, but instead threatened to take measures and called the psychiatrist. She said \"all you need is a bit more energy\" and tossed us a box of neuroleptics (also called anti-psychotics) called Triphtasine. I started taking them the next day and I started feeling \"strange\". The world started to feel separated from me and there was a wave of fear coming to my brain caused by the outer world. When the psychiatrist lady came, I started thinking she used hypnosis on me, because of the derealisation effect those pills gave me. I had been taking the pills every day (because we were told so) and my life had turned into a Living Hell. I started hating things and people, causing havoc. For example I would scratch my skin off with lufa when taking a shower, because oil seemed \"terrible\" to me, my brain would feel hatred towards people for no apparent reason. And then I started thinking that I'm keeping my pet, a lovely budgie, a hostage and that he needs to be set free. I took him outside, a car honk scared him and he flew away. Something I will never forgive, he was my best friend at the time. And with those awful effects of Triphtasine of energised hatred, there would always be this \"nothing is real\" side, filled with the feeling of strangeness and fear, that would lead to \"protecting myself\" by hating people and things (the specific feature of Triphtasine). One time I was expecting a friend to come to my house and I decided to \"be safe\" by taking 2 pills of Triphtasine instead of usual 1, so I would be \"full of energy\" (a misconception I had about that medicine), so when the friend came, I had double the \"nothing is real\" attack that was so strong that I had to lock down in my room and spend hours shaking under my blanket. This proves the straight proportion of the effect to dosage. So Triphtasine for me was a Hell Drug that I wouldn't wish my worst enemy to take. It's just Evil in a pill.\n\nI stopped taking Triphtasine about 18 years ago, when the psychiatrists decided to transition me to neuroleptics injections (a solution in oil that you inject in a muscle tissue once a month). The first chosen drug was Moditen-Depo, an oil solution of a neuroleptic that has a feature of making you pro-active, with will to work and create. No need to say all of the hatred that I had from Triphtasine vanished, but not the \"nothing is real\" part. Most of the time I was just a normal myself, with highteneted will to create something and work, shaking and tapping my legs and feet because of the akathisia (a side effect of neuroleptics that makes you want to move your limbs all the time), that I would neuter with half a pill of Cyclodol (an anti-parkinsonic medicine). But about 4 to 8 times a month there would still be this \"Nothing is real\" episodes that would last for 6 to 8 hours. I would name those \"nothing is real\" states \"Bogeyman attacks\", because at that time I would play the game called \"Ghostmaster\", where the goal is to spook people using ghost characters, and I liked the idea a funny ghost game character was trying to cast a spell on me. But as long as I had 0.5 pill of Cyclodol, I would feel fine in about 30 minutes.\n\nLater, because of my country's sorry state of medicare, Moditen-Depo stopped being available anywhere, the doctors changed my medicine to Haloperidol-Depo for a few months, then to Klopixol-Depo, which I do now. Not because these medicines are better for me, but for the plain fact they have nothing else, the medicare is ruined. All of these drugs still gave me \"nothing is real\" episodes 4-8 times a month.\n\nVery important to note that \"Nothing is real\" attacks only happen when the dosage of the neuroleptic is high in my blood system. On about 2nd - 3rd day is the first attack, then about 4 more during the next 2,5 weeks. When I don't have neuroleptics in my blood (3 weeks, 1 month and on after the injection) I never have those \"Bogeyman attacks\". More proof: I tried getting off the medicine for 3 times, all 3 times I had zero \"nothing is real\" episodes.\n\nThen in 2014 my lovely government made new laws and they cancelled Cyclodol, which is now considered pretty much an illegal drug. The medicine that would ease the \"nothing is real\" frightful episodes along with the parkinsonic effect. I must note, that my dosage of Cyclodol was at least 6 times less than the one in the prescription - 0.5 pill when the episode occured instead of 2 pills every day (!). So now, thanks to many \"clever\" people, I have 4 to 8 \"nothing is real\" attacks a month, with nothing to neuter it with, a state when I can do nothing, only being afraid for hours. And also the risk of parkinson's disease.\n\nBut on the bright side:\n\n I know now that the \"nothing is real\" episodes are caused by side effects of neuroleptics. And, possibly, other medicines that I never had too, but other people could be taking. The evidence I collected over 20 years is pretty much fool-proof, there are no contradictions in it and I'm able to control and predict my own \"nothing is real\" states. Maybe it's about the time that the problem severly bugging many people finds a simple solution.\n\nAbout me: I'm 37, a completely normal person, taking neuroleptics injections once a month, which (as doctors say themselves) caused my organism to be dependent over 20 years. I never had hallucinations or psychotic episodes in my life and my personal belief is than my tiny teenage problems every kid has, had not to be solved by drugging me 20 years ago. Even though they say \"every patient says that\".\n\nThank you! Hope this problem finds a solution soon! Please, comment and share your knowledge!\n\nCheers!",

        "title": "ECT in New Zealand, a family member's experience",
        "text": "hi.\nI'm writing this because over the last 5 months I've been on a rollercoaster journey supporting a family member who has been suffering with mental illness. At the worst of it ECT was recommended as a treatment, and after recovering from my shock that it still existed as a treatment, I found it has actually had an incredibly positive effect on our lives. So, I thought I'd write this for anyone else in a similar position who might be thinking, holy hell I don't know what to do, am I making the right decision to go ahead with ECT?\n\nOk, first... a quick (internet) definition:\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a procedure, done under general anesthesia, in which small electric currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can quickly reverse symptoms of certain mental illnesses.\n\nThe conceptions I had:\nAn archaic, inhumane, one-flew-over-the-cuckoos-nest treatment of people already suffering. A treatment that risked leaving a person worse off than they already were with a mental illness.\n\nMy experience:\nIn our case, my family member had been initially diagnosed with bi-polar and then schizophrenia, and then the doctor's eventually admitted they really did not know any longer, just that it was \"a complicated case\". There was a lot of insomnia, mixed with catatonia, mixed with psychosis that was obviously causing my family member incredible pain and stress, and in turn my family a lot of fear, despair and helplessness. \nAfter trying every antipsychotic they had, including Haloperidol (one of the original, and supposedly safer) medications for my family member, ECT was broached as a last resort. I was stunned, I thought 'shocking people' was illegal. I honestly didn't know what to do. My immediate response was no, I won't let you do that. And that my family member didn't want the treatment only added to my resolve. But things just got worse, and worse and worse, and we were waiting days and days for any lucid behaviour. \nEventually our family gave in, we honestly felt there was nothing left to lose.\nThe first treatment was so scary, my family member didn't want to go, and I felt terrible, as the person who was supposed to love them, and have their back that I was leading them by the hand into the surgical ward. \n\nThe procedure itself is really quick, about 5 mins, but the obs after and prep before easily make it a 4 hour ordeal. Once the ECT is administered it's not uncommon for the patient's eyes to be bloodshot and for them to have a headache and be dehydrated. But other than that it doesn't seem to physically be that bad, it's the fear that really makes it bad.\nIt's been several sessions since they began, and I can't tell you the relief we all feel. From day one ECT made a huge difference to the amount of sleep my family member was able to get - sleeping through some nights with no sleeping pills (something that hadn't happened in over a year). \nYes, short-term memory is affected, and they find it difficult to recall the treatments and some recent events. But, I saw my family member smile after the second treatment, which hadn't happened for days. And now, 7 sessions in - my family member was able to come home and sleep in their own bed for the first time in seven months.\n\nI'm not writing this to get anyone's hopes up unreasonably, but just to say to anyone who is in the position I was a month ago: it is scary, but it can help.\nI really feel ECT has changed our lives for the better, and I hope it can for you too if you're in this situation.",

And of course I lost all Motivation and Desire completely. I dont have anything and I dont want anything. Thus Im basically a living statue now, an empty husk. I dont even remember what it felt like to have a will to Live, I dont miss having feelings and I dont even feel bad for the pain Im causing to those who Love me.  \n\n\nWhy Im gonna take Haldol: My Family gave me an ultimatum, I will either take Drugs willingly or I will be committed to an Asylum. This will be the first time ever I will take a Neuroactive Drug and although Im not scared, Im concerned I will become non-functional or a completely different person altogether.  \n\n\nWhat Ive learnt about Haldol (If something is not right please correct me):   \n\\- Its a Typical Anti-Psychotic, meaning it works on the D2 Neuroreceptors only  \n\\- It causes Extrapyramidal Effects, basically involuntary changes in locomotive activity  \n\\- It may cause Neuroleptic Effects, which are changes in basic body functions like Temperature regulation  \n\n\nIt also has a TON of other Secondary Effects, but those mentioned above are the ones I should expect  \n\n\nWhat do I make of this? I will try it anyways (because Im basically being forced to), but what should I prepare for? What should I expect and be wary of? ",

        "text": "Hi beautiful people \ud83d\udc4b \n\nI was unfortunately misdiagnosed with schizophrenia in the ER due to severe anxiety and side effects/withdrawal symptoms of Benzodiazepines and Barbiturates that I was taking previously. I was given 5mg of Haloperidol by IM injection combined with 2mg of Lorazepam by IM injection at around 9AM in the morning. This was in the ER before they admitted me to the psych ward. Then once I was in the psych ward, I likely became a little restless but I was never a threat to nobody. I think the nurses just wanted to sedate and knock me out for the rest of the evening. So it says on my records I was again injected with 5mg of Haloperidol by IM combined with 2mg of Lorazepam by IM combined with 50mg of Benadryl by IM and this combination occurred at around 6:30PM. It was after this second injection that I became a literal zombie. I immediately fell asleep right after and when I woke up. I could not move. I think I was even having trouble feeling my body. It felt like I was having a stroke. I eventually became very rigid, my speech started to slur and this then progressed to mutism which was documented when the social worker came to talk to me because she wrote down that I was nonverbal and unable to conduct therapy at the moment. I then became catatonic and just started stating off into a wall without moving. Meanwhile, I could hear the psych nurses saying that my mental illness was progressing and that I was getting worse and that I was now catatonic. They never once mentioned it could be from the B52 they gave me. It doesn\u2019t stop here however in spite of my zombie like state because then it says the following day at 5:30PM, I was injected again with 2mg of Lorazepam by IM combined with 20mg of Geodon by IM. Funny thing is I don\u2019t even remember that injection. Shortly after this injection, visiting hours were held at the psych ward and my relative came to see me and see how I was doing. Needless to say, she was shocked at my zombie like state and I also had developed dystonia by that time and my neck started flexing to the left, my muscles were all shaking, I don\u2019t even think I was able to walk, my speech was still slurred if not mute. My relative freaked out and threatened to call the cops and the news stations on the hospital\u2019s psych ward so the psych ward people then proceeded to call for a hospital code for rapid response team to transfer me to a regular room in the hospital. They did an EKG and arterial blood gas testing, gave me oxygen, and hooked me up to IV fluids. I slowly became better over the course of the next few days and the in-hospital neurologist ran a Brain MRI which came back clear and an EEG which came back clear. As you can tell, this whole situation was a nightmare and a terrible mistake. I could not believe what I had to go through. My questions is, given the severity of my symptoms/reaction where I was practically a dystonic, catatonic, and mute zombie, was I overdosed or over medicated at the psych ward? Again the following doses are what I received according to the records:\n\n9AM Day 1\n-5mg of Haloperidol by IM\n-2mg of Lorazepam by IM\n\n6:30PM Day 1\n-5mg of Haloperidol by IM\n-2mg of Lorazepam by IM\n-50mg of Benadryl by IM\n\n5:30PM Day 2\n-2mg of Lorazepam by IM\n-20mg of Geodon by IM\n\nDoes this constitute as an overdose?\n\n",

It currently makes voices and thoughts quieter although im still experiencing symptoms of thought broadcasting and hallucination of voices. Ive searched up another drug called Haldol ( haloperidol ) which people claim that it works. What i want to know is there any major side effects of Haldol as ive experienced medications like paliperidone which killed my sex drive and im wondering if Haldol would do the same.\n\nHave you been treated with Haldol before? If so, please enlighten me with your experiences with it.\n\nThanks !",

Don't lose hope, no one is an exeption. There are plenty of meds out there for a reason,  you could respond differently depending on the formula.\n\nBut you have to be honest talking about your symptoms with your doctor. You don't necessarily have to tell your psychiatrist about the content of the hallucinations, and I tell you this because I know that these conditions often represent deep fear, shame and guilt. So, believe me, you can think about it later. The first thing is to stop the hallucinations and you can do this with antipsychotics. Don't smoke joints. Really sorry, but we just can't. I did It more than a few times and the voices always came back. So, trust me, Just put psycho-active drugs away. \n\nSo, don't lie to your doctor about your wellbeing, otherwise it will be impossible for you to heal. Because you can fucking heal. I did lie to my doctor because I used to feel hopeless and I was paranoid about everything. No one should ever feel this way about a condition that is medicable.\n\nYou can do it!!!!!! You can take your life back, but remember: \n\n1- Be honest with the doctor about your symptoms (hallucinations and how they make you feel)\n2-This is the most important. Don't believe the hallucinations, keep being grounded in reality. You have to be able to differentiate the hallucinations from the reality. People are not against you, they just would help, if the knew. \n3-Never lose hope! If a med isn't working, fine, go on with the next one! \n\n I am here if someone has questions  \n\nGood luck, big hug \n",

I know \u201cparanoid\u201d schitzophrenia has been dropped from DSN manual as a subtype of the illness. I definitely think she has some sort of disorder but from reading about all the other typical, common symptoms of schitzophrenia, I am starting to doubt she got diagnosed properly in Ukraine. She will be seeing a new psychiatrist to verify her diagnosis, but I'm assuming that takes time and he can't diagnose her on the spot? She is taking medication (Haloperidol and others I think) and it does seem to work for her speech so maybe she does have schitzophrenia after all.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. **Role of Dopamine in Consciousness**: Studies with dopamine-deficient mice suggest that dopamine signaling is crucial for the expression of consciousness. Dopamine-deficient mice exhibit deficits in attention, learning, memory, and motivation, despite being awake and responsive to stimuli. Restoration of dopamine signaling restores most behaviors, indicating the importance of dopamine in maintaining consciousness.\n2. **Association Between Dopamine and Spirituality**: The paper discusses the relationship between dopamine and spiritual experiences, particularly during meditation. PET studies show a significant increase in dopamine release during meditation practices such as Yoga Nidra. This suggests that dopamine plays a role in the neurochemical processes underlying spiritual practices and experiences.\n3. **Impact of Dopamine on Religiosity**: There is a proposed link between dopamine function, specifically within the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), and religiosity. Hypoactivity of the medial PFC may result in decreased religiosity, characterized by reckless behavior, self-indulgence, and impaired theory of mind. Conversely, hyperactivity of the medial PFC may lead to heightened religiosity, marked by rigid conformity, excessive self-concern, and overinterpretation of others' thoughts.\n4. **Potential Psychotic Effects of Dopamine Modulation**: The paper suggests that dopamine modulation, along with other neurochemical changes induced by meditation, can lead to psychotic states. Increased dopamine, along with other neurotransmitters like serotonin and DMT, may contribute to schizophrenomimetic effects and psychotic-like experiences during meditation.\n\nIn summary, the evidence presented supports the idea that dopamine levels can influence self-awareness, conscious experience, and spirituality. Changes in dopamine function may impact cognitive processes, emotional regulation, and perception, ultimately affecting one's sense of self and spiritual experiences.  \n\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nReference:  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4737196/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4737196/)\n\n>  \nDopamine improved the prediction by subjective awareness of objective  performance in an online task with minimal self\u2010awareness (noetic  metacognition). Dopamine also enhanced extended self\u2010awareness with  introspection (autonoetic metacognition) concomitant with stimulation of  the anterior cingulate/prefrontal cortex, a process which seems to be  tightly linked to incentive stimulation and reward\n\n  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839810/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839810/)\n\n>  \nThe neural correlates of consciousness are largely unknown but many neural circuits are likely to be involved. Our experiments with mice  that cannot synthesize dopamine suggest that dopamine signaling is a  critical component necessary for the expression of consciousness.  Although dopamine-deficient mice are awake and respond to many stimuli,  they are unmotivated and have profound deficits in all but the simplest  learning tasks. Dopamine-deficient mice are unable to attend to salient  sensory information, integrate it with prior experience, store it in  long-term memory, or choose appropriate actions. While clearly conscious  from a general anesthetic point of view, dopamine-deficient mice have  marginal arousal and appear to be virtually unconscious from a  behavioral point of view. Restoration of dopamine signaling within the  striatum by viral gene therapy strategies restores most behaviors.  Therefore, I propose that dopaminergic modulation of glutamatergic  inputs from the cortex and thalamus onto medium spiny neurons in the  striatum contributes to cognition and the expression of consciousness.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190564/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190564/)\n\n>  \nThe role of spirituality as a resource for finding meaning and hope in suffering has also been identified as a key component in the process of psychological recovery. Most studies have shown that religious  involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes,  including greater longevity, coping skills and health-related quality  of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression and  suicide  \n\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>A study conducted on students in a large metropolitan area showed that  religious factors were strongly associated with lower drug abuse, even  after controlling for the relevant socio-demographic and educational  variables.  The role of spirituality in addiction was also reflected upon in a  study, which found that smoking and frequent binge drinking were  negatively correlated with spirituality scores  \n\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Most of the studies examining them used functional imaging as the  investigation tool, to delineate the neural mechanisms involved in these  practices. They include the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies  on Yoga, Tantric Yoga and Yoga Nidra; the Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (MRI) study on Kundalini Yoga; and the Single Photon Emission  Computerized Tomography (SPECT) study on Tibetan meditation. The studies  point to prefrontal activation, transient hypofrontality, increased  frontal lobe and decreased parietal lobe activity and also to a  deafferentation of the posterior superior parietal lobule (PSPL) in  spirituality  \n\\[...\\]  \nThere is substantial evidence from the psychology of religion to  suggest that people are prepared \u2018for religious experiences and this  readiness\u2019 is probably mediated by the dorsomedial frontal cortex,  leading to the commonly reported felt immediacy of religious experience.  The experience, however, becomes religious when people consciously  identify the experience as consistent with their own religious schema.  This cognitive process most probably involves the dorsolateral,  prefrontal and medial parietal cortex. Therefore, the prefrontal regions  mediate both the preparedness of religious experience and conscious  cognitive process involved in the appreciation of religious experience  \n\\[...\\]  \nFurther, it is proposed that a balanced function of the medial PFC is  needed to maintain balanced religious activities. The specific functions  involved in this regulation of religion are those mediating compliance  to rules and customs, self-reflection and the understanding of thoughts  and feelings of others with compassion and empathy (theory of mind).  Theory of mind (ToM) or mentalization is the ability to recognize that  someone else has a mind different from one's own. It involves the  ability to infer someone else's mind by facial expression, tone of voice  and non-verbal communication.  \n\\[...\\]  \nThe medial PFC is involved in error detection and monitoring and  compliance to social norms and therefore is involved in mediating  compliance to rules and customs. The medial PFC along with the posterior  cingulate is involved in self-reflective thought and this helps the  person to have an insight into his own experience and the perception of  self in relation to the divine being. The third regulatory function,  which includes the theory of mind, involves the medial PFC, especially  the orbitofrontal cortex, the lesion of which impairs theory of mind  tasks. Based on this it is hypothesized that the hypofunction of the  medial PFC results in decreased religiosity (hyporeligiosity). This  would result from a combination of reckless and lawless behaviour  (impaired error detection), self-indulgence (loss of self reflection)  and an inability to consider the thoughts of others (impaired theory of  mind). Hyperfunction of the medial PFC, on the other hand, will lead to  rigid conformity with rules and customs, excessive concern over oneself  and one's existence and excessive interpretation of the mind of others,  all of which results in heightened religiosity (hyperreligiosity)  \n\\[...\\]  \nThe dopaminergic system, via the basal ganglia, is involved in cortical  subcortical interactions and a PET study on the dopaminergic tone in  Yoga Nidra using 11 C-raclopride showed significant increase of dopamine  during meditation.  During meditation, 11C-raclopride binding in ventral striatum decreased  by 7.9%. This corresponds to a 65% increase in endogenous dopamine  release  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \nMeditation can induce psychotic states via mechanism such as increased 5HT2  receptor activation, increased DMT, increased NAAG and increased  dopamine. The mechanisms include the 5HT inhibition of LGB, the  hallucinogenic effects of DMT, the dissociative hallucinogenic effects  of NAAG and the action of increased dopamine in the temporal lobe. A  variety of schizophrenomimetic effects can be seen as a result of these  complex neurochemical changes.\n\n&#x200B;",

I live in a small town in Russia, where life was already not sugar, and now it has become simply unbearable. Due to constant poverty and mental problems, my life has turned into a real nightmare. \n\nThere is barely enough money for the most necessary things - food and utilities. Prices are constantly rising, and wages are poor. We have to save on everything, even on medicines. I suffer from schizophrenia, I need expensive drugs like Ariprizol, Haloperidol and Ziprex, but there is simply nothing to buy them with. It is useless to seek help from doctors - there are always not enough medicines in our district hospital. Some of the chief doctors steal, which is not uncommon in my country, while others simply resell equipment and medicines to private clinics.\n\nPeople have turned away from me, many openly despise and hate me. No one wants to help a \"psycho\" like me. I feel like an outcast, abandoned to the mercy of fate. Sometimes it seems to me that it is easier to commit suicide than to endure this terrible life. Constant suicidal thoughts exhaust me very much. If this continues, I won't be able to stand it.\u2026\n\nSometimes it happens that the world around you seems blurry, unreal. It is difficult to concentrate, thoughts get confused, reality gets mixed up with hallucinations. Sometimes it feels like I'm watching myself from the sidelines, like this isn't my life. Often feeling paranoia and fear, I want to go somewhere in the back room and never come out, where there will be no problems, but a happy life, as before.\n\nI can't even ask my relatives in Western Ukraine for help, because they themselves are suffering from the current situation, they don't have much money either.\n\nMy life has become a living hell.

Is it realistic to be able to expect medication to eliminate my psychosis entirely and all my delusions? Or am I holding my expectations too high, and is the partial relief I\u2019m getting on my current medication about as much as I can hope for.\n\n\u2014-\n\nFor reference I\u2019ve tried two medications so far. I\u2019ve tried Risperidone, which helped quite a bit, but I\u2019m still paranoid, still very anxious, and still can\u2019t function normally at all (I struggle to even go on my own computer many days like today for fear of being watched) due to my delusions. Higher doses made me unbelievably tired, once again to the point of not functioning.\n\nI then tried Haloperidol recently. The lowest doses didn\u2019t really work very well at all, higher doses rid me of more delusions than Risperidone (though not everything) but gave me unbearable akathisia so after a few days I had to give up on it.\n\nI\u2019m afraid to try more medications after my akathisia experience, because I don\u2019t feel equipped to handle a single more day of that - but especially if it\u2019s not likely to improve my delusions much more than Risperidone already was. But is that the case? Or is it likely I can find a medication that rids me of them completely?",

Previously it was Risperidone, but as of today I'm supposed to start Haloperidol for the mornings instead, and then in just over a week's time fully make the switch to Haloperidol for the nights as well.\n\nEvery so often I'll have a night when I don't manage to sleep very well and wake up after 3-4 hours. Tonight was one of those nights. I've spent about an hour tossing and turning hoping to get back to sleep, but it's evident that it's not happening. \n\nMy question is, should I take my medication now? My inclination would be yes, I'm up, I'm paranoid, my day is starting - but one of my relatives has been telling me I need to wait and take it at the same time as I'd take it if I woke up normally (so in like 6 hours).\n\nObviously the best person to ask would be my psychiatrist but it's currently 3:40AM so a touch too early to ask her. So I thought I'd ask here. I assume in the morning after breakfast is irrespective of my wake up time, but maybe someone here knows what's best and can chime in.\n\nThanks a ton.",

In the past I had strange thoughts and some paranoid thoughts and brief hallucinations visually. Lately, I have times where I'm acting wrong or inappropriately cause I think my ideas are real. Such as my mom being a spy and ignoring her texts. I apologized to her the next day. Today I was very hostile towards family cause I thought they were against me. My disabled sister tends to be my focus of my ideas and beliefs. For awhile she was the demon child. Was given haloperidol to calm down. Had a set back cause side effects, prolactin and lactation. Oddly enough prolactin was normal. The hostility lately is a ton. I told my dr to give me back my og dose cause that helped. I just restarted my good dose. I was yelling and was in fear that my sis is the top dog and I must obey her or she'll throw another tantrum. She didn't like me doing what I thought was a solution from fear .I was also singing how I must obey her during the task. She didn't my results, from fear I yelled at her and my dad. She didn't let me rest either due her behavior from her brain damage. \n\nI felt better after sleeping, but it's never ending   it is very bad. I never acted on my ideas in the past   \n\nAny feedback?",

        "text": "#TL;DR can akathisia induced by a med go away by continuing to take it/taking even more of it? Or do I need to reduce/stop it and go back to my old med for now?\n\nI started taking Risperidone at the end of August. It was helping me get out of my shell more, reduced the more severe delusions and was generally a huge improvement. However I was still quite paranoid, so had several dose increases. The final dose increase to 2mg + 2mg caused me to develop bad anhedonia and tiredness, and still didn\u2019t rid me of my paranoid delusions sufficiently, so I requested a new medication.\n\nI was put on Haloperidol. Started with 0.5mg in the morning with 1mg of my old Risperidone at night, then 1 and 1. After still feeling paranoid I spoke to my psychiatrist and she increased me to 2mg + 2mg of Haloperidol.\n\nEven the first day I wasn\u2019t able to fully complete this regimen. I couldn\u2019t take the second 2mg because after taking the first 2mg I developed severe akathisia. I couldn\u2019t sit still or be comfortable. If I moved I was uncomfortable and it felt like I was having to control every single muscle and it felt like a strenuous effort to do so. If I stayed still, it felt like I physically had to hold every muscle in place rather than relaxing them. It was unbearable and I only even got to sleep in the end because I had some left over alprazolam from a previous prescription.\n\nMy psychiatrist is currently on vacation so I didn\u2019t want to trouble her for advice, so yesterday I tried an in between dose: 1.5mg. Unfortunately it was more of the same. I was at times less restless than the previous day, at times more restless, but it once again ended the same with me needing to take my alprazolam just to be able to relax enough to sleep. Something I don\u2019t want to repeat again because I don\u2019t want to rely on that, especially when I don\u2019t have an active prescription for it anymore.\n\nThe trouble is I don\u2019t know what to do now. My psychiatrist is still away for the next few days, so I can\u2019t yet request a new medication.\n\n**Is it possible for the akathisia to get better if I continue with the Haloperidol? Or maybe even if I took the full 2mg + 2mg I\u2019d be better than I was on just 2mg?**\n\n**Or should I just take my former Risperidone (which didn\u2019t cause akathisia for me) until my psychiatrist is back and request something else?**\n\n**Also is there anything you guys found helped akathisia that I could perhaps get OTC?** I don\u2019t want to rely on alprazolam again unless I have absolutely 0 other options - and I obviously can\u2019t get anything else prescribed until my psychiatrist is back, so I\u2019m limited to things I can get OTC like herbs and such. Or to relaxation techniques or whatever.\n\nThe only thing I found gave me some relief yesterday other than the alpraz was actually ASMR. There was a 1 hour period where I was able to put on ASMR and astonishingly my body relaxed for the entire duration. It was such a dramatic effect. So I might try that again if it comes back today.",

        "text": "Was wondering if someone who is under antipsychotic medications especially in high doses are able to function in school, college or work? Eversince I've been on these medications I started to work less efficiently, less productively and cannot do well in time management... initially (these symptoms are improving as time passes by). The antispychotics I am on are dopamine antagonists (risperidone and haloperidol) which make it harder for me to do things because I cannot enjoy/ derive pleasure from doing them. Everything feels dull. I can barely even do household chores. Ive been out of school for four years because of my mental illness. I am slowly recovering though and is now stable. I am wondering if anyone has gotten back to school and handle all the stress even if youre in these medications. I had gotten dumber, lazy and dysfunctional when I started the meds, but i noticed ive improved when the medicine dose decreased. I dont think my doctor would reduce my meds anytime soon and I already want to get back to school. Ive been studying some random stuff while at home so I think I might be able to handle school. \n\nmy doctor told me there are schizophrenic patients that successfully became doctors, police officers and etc. which sort of came across to me as a load of crap when I did some research since mentally ill people arent qualified to become police officers. I think he is lying to me.",

        "text": "Hello, my name's Martyna and I am 17 years old. Soon to be 18.\n\nI wanted to share my story because I am not comfortable with people in my surroundings to learn it just yet.\n\nI was recently (3 days ago) officially diagnosed with Schizophrenia which took a long one-year process of finding a genuine psychiatrist that looked into my case and received starting medication (Haloperidol-Richer 1.5mg).\n\nI struggled with severe depression and anxiety which led to suicidal thoughts. My family isn't educated on this topic and therefore cannot support me emotionally, which leaves most of the understanding of what the fuk is up with me on my own. I first drew conclusions about Bipolar...yet I started visiting the school's psychologist which did a psychodiagnostic and we found out that it's something from the schizo spectrum and from there it was a kick towards a more concrete direction. Even though I was already diagnosed with adaptation disorder (F 43.2) in the past.\n\nIt took me over 2 years of suffering from depression to actually confess that I am struggling and receive help. I went to consultations with the psychologist and art therapy for 6 months and it helped me very very much and shined even a clearer path on what might be the issue. \n\nAround 4 months ago I transferred to the active stage of schizophrenia that arose hallucinations, many many very twisted delusions, and growing paranoia towards the world, people, and even myself. I never had many friends in my life, they either pushed me away or the contact just disappeared. So, social isolation wasn't very surprising but I noticed that it has gotten severe, where I wouldn't even go outside to breathe some air or pet my doggies. \n\nThat's where I got more attention because my grades have been dropping drastically because of trouble with focus/attention and memory. I have an issue that I am able to learn the theory and what the book and teacher intend to say, but I can't apply it when I get a test. I get really anxious and sometimes experience anxiety attacks. I am a student in the IBDP program which is seriously difficult but I just feel the responsibility to be here. I also have built my bonds and I learned so much together with amazing teachers that helped me along the way, therefore if I were to spend my last year in some public school unhappy and graduate with no smile and people with who I suffered together with, I would probably be as good as just dead...\n\nMy mother is very worried that as she pays a lot for my education if I will fail then I would be a waste. The same way she thinks about my driving because it is taking me a long time to develop the skill of handling a manual. But again, I don't want to give it up just yet, even if yesterday I had a very bad panic attack due to feeling emotionally abandoned by family. The only person in the family with that I am honest about my condition is my older sister. She lives with her partner and occasionally visits which for me is the biggest joy. But I feel very comfortable with her and her way of living. \n\nI am quite tired of everything and suicidal thought has been popping up more and more recently which isn't comforting whatsoever...\n\nI don't know what else to add, I feel tired and lost my focus. So, this is for now what is sitting on the top of my head and what I wanted to get off my heart. I hope you weren't bored with this vent and maybe find the time to tell me what you thought of it. Do I sound stupid or is it a genuine shitty experience at a young age? \n\nThank you so much for reading (if you did) and I guess I'll be hanging out around here, looking for some company :))",

My Dr prescribed take 9mg Invega in the morning and 3mg Invega when needed.\n\nWhat actually happened was I need pre-authorization and can't. So I'm actually now only getting 3mg of risperidone 1 time before bed.

I post on Reddit and social media non stop, and I have been just saying anything as an escape from my illness.\n\nI have delusions of grandeur and also imposter syndrome (as it applies to my art).

I also had vivid dreams about other patients getting into my bed and touching me and whispering to me and overall the experience took it's toll on my psyche rather than improving it (apart from making some friends of course). I also left some art in there a friend is retrieving for me to incorporate into his novel about his own experiences.\n\nIs this normal?

But she is still doing very bad, she seems ok at one point and the next minute she is alone in her room and doesnt understand if I am me or my sister or worries about worms in food and cant eat. She doesnt trust us much during those thoughts as well so it is super difficult to help her when she closes up. \nWe got her sleeping pills so at least she is not wandering around the whole night anymore and the being-okay-moments got more frequent after sleeping pills came.\nThe doctor said we could think about hospitalising her and I only want best for her- doctor didnt know to say which option is better as well.\n\nWe have not seen out grandmother in such a bad shape for at least 30 years, haloperidol should have been kicked in after a few days as the doc said. She is still very delusional tho.. what are the advantages of hospitalising, can it have a good effect on elderly? I cant imagine it being easy on an elderly, the change of the environment etc during derealisation especially, but i wanna be sure it is the right decision to keep her home. We are with her every minute almost but if the doesn\u2019t feel safe even with us, then I am not feeling super confident in home not hospital- i am lost.. \n\nAlso mentioning that she is having mostly paranoid thoughts about our grandfather wanting to hurt her, then lots of derealisation (related to home and us) and other delusions that make her feel unsafe.",

        "title": "What Schizophrenia Really Is According to Walsh",
        "text": "Schizophrenia is not one condition. \"Schizophrenia\" is an umbrella classification given to several different disorders, each with different symptoms, root causes, and methods of treatment.\n\nMost psychiatrists are unaware of this, leading them to treat patients by perscribing them different anti-psychotics and tranquilizers in a trial-and-error approach to determine which medication is effective. This is a precarious approach, as it disregards the biochemical individuality of the patient, and risks worsening symptoms by further destabilizing brain chemistry, all in the hopes that the practitioner will stumble upon the right combination of medicines. When abilify doesn't work,  perscribe asenapine, when that doesn't work administer clozapine, or geodon, and when all else fails try risperdal. Each of these medications, while effective, come with their own host of side effects - some worse than the symptoms of the illness itself.\n\nSo, if schizophrenia is *one* disorder, then why is it so difficult to treat? How can it be the case that certain medications work for some people, while others don't? What about cases of sudden remission of the illness?\n\nWilliam Walsh, who in his 30 years of psychiatric research has taken over 50,000 blood tests of people with psychiatric illnesses such as depression, ADHD, bi-polar disorder, and schizophrenia (the largest and most comprehensive of such an archive in the world), claims to have developed a reasonable hypothesis for what schizophrenia is. He claims that there are five biotypes of psychiatric illnesses. These categories were not only based on symptoms, but also on comprehensive blood testing for nutrients and compounds. But before we list the five main biotypes of schizophrenia, let's delve into the most commonly circulated hypothesis, the dopamine theory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The High Dopamine, Low Glutamate Theory**\n\nThe current theory of schizophrenia is the high dopamine theory.  Excessive excitement of the dopamine receptors can cause the emergence of psychotic symptoms. This is the case when drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines, which increase dopamine, are administered in high dosages. This theory was formed upon the discovery that dopamine receptor blockade by antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol reduced psychotic symptoms. It should come as no surprise that high dopamine levels have been observed in the brains of many schizophrenics, further lending credence to this theory.\n\nHowever, PET scans used to examine interactions in the brain revealed that there were some patients who exhibited symptoms of psychosis even with 90% of their D2 receptors blocked by antipsychotic medications. This happened mostly in patients who dealing with the illness for multiple decades. Furthermore, may atypical antipsychotics have a lower affinity for dopamine receptors, yet are effective at treating the negative symptoms of the condition.\n\nNDMA glutamate activity is also associated with psychotic disorders. PCP acts and ketamine both act as glutamate antagonists; when administered at a high dose, they can produce symptoms which are very similar to psychosis. Low glutamate has also been observed in the brains of psychotics.\n\nAdditionally, *serotonin,* which regulates an enormous number of processes in the body is also widely agreed to play a role in schizophrenia. The 5-HT2A receptor is main receptor targeted by psychedelics such as LSD, Psilocybin (Mushrooms), DMT, and mescaline, and is thought to mediate the action of many antipsychotics.\n\nIf it is the case that dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin alone are the cause of this psychiatric condition, re-balancing them should produce a significant reduction in symptoms for all schizophrenics, correct? So why then is it that even after taking multiple SSRI's and dopamine suppressing antipsychotics, sometimes for years, the condition still persists in so many people?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Walsh Theory of Schizophrenia**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thesis 1:  Schizophrenia is Epigenetic in Nature:**\n\nA psychotic breakdown is usually followed by a lifetime of illness and misery.  This often permanent change in functioning results from altered chromatin bookmarks that regulate gene expression.  Since the deviant marks are maintained during future cell divisions, the condition doesn't \u201cgo away\u201d.\n\n**Thesis 2:  Weak Antioxidant Protection is a Distinctive Feature of Schizophrenia:**\n\nMost schizophrenics exhibit a genetic or acquired weakness in antioxidant protection. Evidence from my extensive chemistry database includes generally low levels of glutathione, cysteine, selenium, zinc, polyunsaturated fats, together with high levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper.\n\n**Thesis 3:  Oxidative Overload Produces Deviant Epigenetic Marks in Schizophrenia:**\n\nCancer researchers have identified cumulative oxidative stress as a trigger that can transform healthy cells into cancer cells by altering epigenetic marks that permanently change gene expression. Examples include skin cancer developing after years of excessive sun exposure, and lung cancer following years of cigarette smoking. It\u2019s not a coincidence that nearly all schizophrenia patients exhibit excess oxidative stress.  The onset of schizophrenia occurs when oxidative stresses exceed the threshold level needed to alter chromatin marks that regulate gene expression.\n\n**Thesis 4:  Methylation Imbalances Promote Epigenetic Vulnerability to Oxidative Stress:**\n\nAbnormal methylation of chromatin is a leading cause of epigenetic errors in gene expression.  The combination of oxidative overload and a methyl imbalance can produce gene expression changes that result in a chronic schizophrenia condition.  The two most prevalent forms of schizophrenia develop in persons who exhibit either methyl overload or methyl deficiency.  The two resulting psychotic disorders exhibit very different brain chemistry and symptoms.\n\n**Thesis 5:  Extraordinary Weakness in Antioxidant Protection Can Produce Schizophrenia in the Absence of Methyl Imbalances:**\n\nThe third major schizophrenia phenotype develops in persons with an inborn severe deficit in antioxidant protection.  This condition is arbitrarily termed \u201cPyrrole Disorder\u201d due to the presence of excessive pyrrole levels in blood and urine.  Mental breakdowns occur for these persons during periods of extreme physical or mental stress in which deviant epigenetic marks are established.  This condition is characterized by extraordinary anxiety, rapid mood swings, and often involves both auditory hallucinations and delusional beliefs.  Brain chemistry abnormalities include depressed glutamate activity at NMDA receptors, and very depressed GABA activity.\n\n**Thesis 6:  Failure to Follow Classical Laws of Genetic Inheritance Results From the Epigenetic Nature of Schizophrenia:**\n\nSchizophrenia is strongly heritable (runs in families) but fails to obey Mendel\u2019s classic laws of genetic inheritance.  There are countless examples of identical twins where one sibling develops the disorder and the other does not.  In addition, intensive research efforts to identify the schizophrenia gene (or genes) have met with little success.  Epigenetics provides two explanations for the non-Mendelian nature of schizophrenia: (a) Environmental insults are required to produce deviant epigenetic marks and environmental conditions are highly variable for different individuals, and (b) Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) contributes to schizophrenia heritability by transmitting deviant epigenetic marks to one\u2019s children and grandchildren.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Common Biotypes of Schizophrenia***\n\nThese categories were determined through thousands of blood tests for levels of amino acids, and other compounds critical to neurotransmitter synthesis and cognition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Overmethylation - 46%**\n\nAbout 46% of persons diagnosed with schizophrenia exhibit excessive methylation of chromatin along with weak antioxidant protection. Mental breakdowns generally occur during severe physical or emotional traumatic events that produce overwhelming oxidative stress and deviant gene marks. This schizophrenia biotype is a sensory disorder that generally involves auditory, tactile, or visual hallucinations. This form is of critical importance, as these persons react very poorly to SSRIs. For these patients, taking SSRIs can lead to suicidal or homicide ideation. This condition is associated with elevated activity of dopamine and norepinephrine, and reduced glutamate activity at NMDA receptors.  The most common DSM-5 diagnosis is paranoid schizophrenia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSymptoms & Traits\n\nAuditory hallucinations, paranoia depression, high anxiety and panic attacks, low libido, religiosity, tendency to gain weight, pacing, mood swings/explosive anger, dry eyes, tinnitus, hirsutism, obsessions, frenetic activity, severe intolerance to SSRI antidepressants\n\nEffective medications: atypical antipsychotics such as Risperdal and Geodon.\n\nMedications to be avoided: SSRI Antidepressants\n\nAdditionally, these people may respond well to high doses of niacin or niacinamide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Undermethylation - 28%**\n\nAbout 28% of persons diagnosed with schizophrenia exhibit low methylation of chromatin together with weak antioxidant protection. Mental breakdowns generally occur during severe physical or emotional traumatic events that produce a separate set of altered gene marks.  These people tend to be highly competitive, striving for perfection. Many of these people find that their initial psychotic episode occurred suddenly, during a period of severe stress, such as time in school, or their workplace. Patients such as this often have a calm demeanor, yet high inner tension, they tend to exhibit more of the reasoning distortions such as delusions and paranoia rather than the extreme sensory distortions such as visual and tactile hallucinations. This schizophrenia biotype essentially is a thought disorder with delusions and catatonic tendencies the primary symptoms.  This condition is associated with low activity at serotonin, dopamine, and NMDA receptors.  The most common DSM-5 diagnoses are Schizoaffective Disorder or Delusional Disorder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSymptoms and Traits:\n\nSevere delusions, OCD, catatonic tendencies, phobias, very high libido, high accomplishment prior to onset (perfectionism), denial of illness, low pain tolerance, addictiveness, slenderness, frequent headaches, ritualistic behaviours, rumination about past events, blankminded appearance\n\nEffective medications: antipsychotic SSRIs for depression: Zyprexa, Seroquel, Abilify, Clozaril\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pyrrole Disorder - 27%**\n\nPyroluria, or pyrrole disorder, is a genetically acquired chemical imbalance in which the body produces an abnormally large number of pyrroles. It was first observed during Carl Pfeiffer's urine testing of people suffering from psychotic symptoms. A pyrrole is a chemical consisting of a 5 membered aromatic ring. These chemicals are the byproduct of hemoglobin synthesis and have no known function in the body; they are normally excreted in the urine. Most people have very few pyrroles in their system at any given time; certain individuals, however, have an unusually high number of pyrroles in their bodies, resulting in a condition known as pyroluria. The production of pyrroles/ hydroxyhemopyrrolin can increase with stress, which in turn decreases zinc and B6 \u2013 nutrients that are essential for the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, melatonin, GABA, and acetylcholine. Zinc and B6 fail to be reabsorbed in effective amounts following the onset. Zinc deficiencies have been associated with a number of physiological disorders, including poor immune function, poor growth, and delayed sexual development. Schizophrenic patients suffering from this condition often find that through rebalancing levels of Zinc, B6, and GABA, that they quickly see a reduction in their symptoms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSymptoms:\n\nOnset during severe stress, mixed psychotic symptoms, extreme Anxiety, explosive anger, sensitivity to bright lights and noise, obsessions with negative thoughts, little to no dream recall\n\nEffective medications include all atypical antipsychotics and benzodiazapines (especially Klonapin)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wheat Gluten Intolerance - 4%**\n\nIn some people, there is a poor breakdown of gluten proteins in the G.I. tract, likely due to an intolerant microbiome. Short peptides are formed with opiode-like properties which then travel to the brain and cause inflammation. This condition seems to be the cause of 4% cases of schizophrenia. Upon eliminating wheat, oats, barley, and rye from the diet people suffering from gluten intolerance quickly find that their symptoms have gone into remission.\n\nSymptoms: Mixed psychotic symptoms; worsening of symptoms after the consumption of foods high in gluten\n\nEffective medications include all atypical antipsychotics\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Copper Toxicity - 6%**\n\nCopper is essential to the body. It assists in the production of red blood cells, helps form collagen, absorb iron, and serves a whole host of other functions. It is found in every part of the body - including the brain - where it assists in neuron signaling. It is like a dimmer for neuron communication in the brain.\n\nSo what if a person's body doesn't effectively regulate copper levels, leading to too much copper?\n\nCopper toxicity is marked by extreme levels of copper in the blood and brain, causing a dopamine deficiency and norepinephrine overload. High levels of copper over conduct the brain resulting in sensory excitation and dysregulation. Increased copper retention is necessary to rapidly produce capillaries and blood vessels for the growing fetus, and some mothers are unable to eliminate the excess copper due to estrogen intolerance. Postpartum depression and post partum psychosis is usually caused by copper overload. 17% of the depression patients in the study fit this category. Most patients afflicted with this condition reported little effect from taking SSRIs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSymptoms and traits: Mixed psychotic symptoms with suicidal or homicidal tendencies, more than 95% female with onset during hormonal event, SSRI antipsychotics ineffective\n\nEffective medications: All atypical antipsychotics\n\nMethod of treatment: Rebalancing zinc and copper levels through supplementation and elimination of high copper foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why Niacin can reduce symptoms of Overmethylated Schizophrenia**\n\nNicotinic acid is an organic compound and a form of vitamin B3, a nutrient essential to proper body and brain function.  Niacin and niacinamide both act as dopamine re-uptake promoters and act to remove dopamine from the system. According to the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, high levels fo dopamine cause are are part of the cause of schizophrenia. Dr Abram Hoffer was well known for his experiments with niacin in the treatment of schizophrenia. According to his research, administering high doses (5000mg+) of niacin to overmethylated schizophrenic patients reduced symptoms and cause improvements significantly. You can find various reports around /r/schizophrenia and [schizophrenia.com](https://schizophrenia.com) about people who saw their symptoms improve after supplementing with niacin. If the Walsh hypothesis of schizophrenia is to be believed, these people are likely overmethylated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, now that we've laid out these imbalances, what is the preferred method of testing for, and treating them?**\n\nAccording to Walsh, the main method of correcting these imbalances is advanced nutrient therapy. That is, taking blood tests to screen for the main nutritional imbalances, and then correcting them by supplementing with nutrients and amino acids in a plan tailored to one's unique biochemical makeup. This is critical, as nearly all people suffering from schizophrenia are deficient in several of the key nutrients responsible for cognition. For instance, almost all biotypes displayed a severe deficiency in blood zinc, magnesium, and vitamin D levels - three compounds necessary for the synthesis of various neurotransmitters.\n\nThere are multiple clinics that facilitate this type of testing. Most of them seem to be in the United States, Ireland, and Australia. These labs often test for kryptopyrroles, copper serum, zinc, whole blood Histamine, ceruloplasmin, vitamin D, TSH, CMP14, and homocysteine in order to determine which biotype a person falls into.\n\nAs no two people are unique, no treatment should be either. As such is is not advised that people undertake self diagnosis, as there is a high risk for worsening symptoms if an incorrect determination is made. It is **absolutely** not recommended that people stop taking their prescribed medication and try to do this on their own.\n\nAccording to practitioners specializing in of this method of treating schizophrenia, at least 80% of patients reported that this treatment had a significant impact on their condition, many even reported being able to significantly reduce the dose of their anti-psychotic medication, or eliminate it all together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummarized from the following sources:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_nMcXIoV1VM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nMcXIoV1VM)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bngPW55Po1k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bngPW55Po1k)\n\n[www.mensahmedical.com/images/Schizophrenia-PP\\_1.pdf](https://www.mensahmedical.com/images/Schizophrenia-PP_1.pdf)\n\n[https://archive.org/details/NutrientPowerWilliamJ.WalshPhD](https://archive.org/details/NutrientPowerWilliamJ.WalshPhD)\n\n[https://www.walshinstitute.org/biochemical-individuality--nutrition.html](https://www.walshinstitute.org/biochemical-individuality--nutrition.html)\n\n[http://www.orthomolecularvitamincentre.com/a\\_hoffer\\_schizophrenia.php](http://www.orthomolecularvitamincentre.com/a_hoffer_schizophrenia.php)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2669582/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2669582/)\n\n[https://www.walshinstitute.org/uploads/1/7/9/9/17997321/depression\\_pp\\_2.pdf](https://www.walshinstitute.org/uploads/1/7/9/9/17997321/depression_pp_2.pdf)\n\n[http://www.mensahmedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BiochemicalImbalancesInMentalHealthPopulations.pdf](http://www.mensahmedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BiochemicalImbalancesInMentalHealthPopulations.pdf)\n\n[http://americannutritionassociation.org/sites/default/files/ANA%20Presentation\\_Walsh\\_%2011%2012.pdf](http://americannutritionassociation.org/sites/default/files/ANA%20Presentation_Walsh_%2011%2012.pdf)\n\n[http://www.kumc.edu/Documents/integrativemed/830am\\_DrWalsh\\_%20BD\\_ADHD\\_ASD.pdf.pdf](http://www.kumc.edu/Documents/integrativemed/830am_DrWalsh_%20BD_ADHD_ASD.pdf.pdf)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjXWF7kdvw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjXWF7kdvw)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4083629/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4083629/)\n\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/490850](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/490850)",

        "text": "I've been diagnosed with BPD for like nearly 4 years now. I've always experienced auditory hallucinations and sometimes visual. And my actual diagnosis was 'BPD with psychotic symptoms'. So I've always believed that that's what it was.\n\nRecently my psychotic symptoms have got a lot worse after coming off one of my antipsychotics (haloperidol). I stopped taking it because it can cause movement disorders if you take it long term, and Id been on it 2 and a half years, so my psychiatrist agreed that I come off it. I'm still taking quetiapine, but I had a meeting with my psychiatrist today and he seems to think I may have schizophrenia? I'm just wondering if you can have BPD and schizophrenia.. or do I just experience psychotic symptoms with my BPD.\n\nHe seems to think I've got the wrong diagnosis but I definitely experience all things BPD and have done since as long as I can remember. At the time I was diagnosed with BPD i was like YES this all makes sense now!!\n\nBut I do experience hallucinations and have had psychosis a few times.. and it seems that if i don't take haloperidol, my psychotic symptoms worsen, a LOT. But I don't want to go back on haloperidol unless absolutely necessary.\n\nSo like I say is it possible to have both BPD and schizophrenia?? Because I reckon I'm experiencing both..",

I take 2mg Risperidone and monthly injection of Haloperidol... for schizophrenia (obviously hehe)\n\nWhen i started drinking these meds Ive been having episodes of losing of focus sometimes (initially, sometimes it happens three times a week at most), and my head hurts so bad like its tearing apart at the same time whenever it happens. My vision mainly focuses on small things like dust and cannot focus on someone's face. I dont know why it happens and even Google cant explain it. Does anybody else have experience or knowledge about this?\n\n I really need your help. Please share me some of your knowledge. Sometimes the pain is becoming unbearable that I want to kill myself. I told my doctor about it but they only dismiss it by advising me to drink Akidin(aka Biperidin), telling me its a side effect of the medicine and can be resolved with Akidin. I do not tell them about my suicidal thoughts because I do not want them to increase my medicine (high medicine intake give me so many unwanted side effects). The Akidin does NOT help at all. \n\nBut my body is getting quite used to it as time goes by. It was pretty severe at the beginning and its been two years since I started these medicine. Sometimes it only happens once a week by now, or even every two to three weeks sometimes. But it still pretty concerning and troubling. I do not go to school, do any household chore or anything at all because of some other more major side effects I experience. \n\nI noticed it started when my crazy doctor cut my risperidone to 4mg cold turkey from a high dosage of 8mg after three months during my initial stage of psychosis. I thought it must be a withdrawal effect or some brain damage caused by the sudden drop of the dose.",

        "title": "Reasons Why My Voices are Not Hallucinations",
        "text": "Background:  Since September of 2014, my above floor neighbors had been repetitively stomping with heels, slamming doors with the lock sticking out, dropping heavy objects, banging, screaming, late night talking, hitting furniture against wall etc, like a construction or war-zone..  It was also one of the coldest winters I ever experienced.  I didn't have heat so my window cracked, at some peculiar times.    I had a severe head cold in November of 2014 that caused my nose to make a mucus popping sound at some peculiar times.  I can't remember exactly if it was before or after I saw the movie *Interstellar* at the omnidome theater but, I first started hearing internal noises sometime between January 12th and January 15th 2015 during my sophomore spring semester.  The noises did not come out of nowhere.  I was in my dorm imagining a conversation while looking at social media.  Back then, I could simulate voices in my head so I was imaging the voice of John Lennon and some woman as like side commentary on my thoughts.  Then immediately after trying this the voices kept going on repeating without me in control.  The male voice started shrinking into a higher pitch until it disappeared.  Then the female voice just sounded like gibberish imitating radio static-like noises.  It went on this way for months until I stayed on campus that summer session for a job and class but, was unfortunately placed next to the construction of a new dorm and a busy street.  So, July 3rd that year, I went to a cemetery for the first time in my life instead of going to a park like I originally planned.  The fireworks on July 4th was hurting my head and going off at some peculiar times.  I couldn't fall asleep.  I heard a deep male voice say \"No\" when I was trying to sleep.  I had these weird feelings of falling and motion sickness.  I became delusional and paranoid.  After a near pedestrian accident on a busy sidewalk, I got superstitious thinking I would suffer from the confrontation so I went home and was committed by my mom to the psych ward that my older sister, who had been diagnosed with a number of mental illnesses, had gone to.  I was diagnosed with psychotic depression.  I didn't return to my university which began its semester on August 25th, the same day the female voice said \"fine\" and left.  The gibberish static-like noises returned in March 2016 but went away again at the end of the semester.  On the last hot day of the year, my voices returned again.  There's more detail to the background story but, it would be a lot to read.\n\nDreams:  I've had premonition dreams: June 2014 about my workplace entrance having a detour, 1/4/18 and in April 2018, and a short vision in late June 2015 about fall of 2016.  I've had dreams that relate to the voice I had been predominately hearing the night before.  One such dream I woke up with the feeling of something scratching my arm.  I've had a series of prophetic-like dreams before I started hearing voices.\n\nVoices and Pain:  I have a little purple notebook named *1066 phrases* which I have only filled up to 755 unique phrases that my voices have said.  I've had voices that were very graphic and characterized like you could picture what type of person that voice would come from.  I've heard voices similar to Trump and Nixon.  I've heard voices like Barbie  .  They repeat things like racist, cancer, cannibal, poop, smell, poison, zika virus, butt, fungus, Japanese, Mexican, African,  It gets triggered by orange and red things/people and by my pet white cat. I would hear the same voices in my music at the same times in the songs on track loop. Lately, I've been having pain from nowhere, tingling in teeth, electric shock in feet and earaches.\n\nSynchronocities:  I have a few vague memories of the TV referencing me as a child.  I've always had a feeling I would go insane or that I would experience something that couldn't been explained or supernatural.  I don't want to go into explicit detail of every synchronocity I have experience, if you want to know more message me.  I will say I have documented hundreds of occasions over the past 5 years from weird coincidences on my birthday to doppelgangers and from finding books to winning/losing video games at certain times on specific dates and computer crashes, notifications and glitches.  I used to see the Cleveland Indians Chief Wahoo logo at some peculiar times (I have some native ancestry by the way).\n\nTreatment:  Well, in the past five years or so, I've been on nearly a dozen types of drugs: Zyprexa, Invega (now I'm currently on the shot), Latuda, flophenazie, clozapine, quentipine, risperidone, lithium carbonate, haloperidol, bupropion, benztropine etc.  The effects range from no effect to worse, louder more aggressive voices.  I have undergone Electra-convulsive Therapy surgery which did not affect my symptoms and a CAT scan which did not reveal anything unusual.  I've had one IQ test from a psychologist, many psychiatrists and therapists who don't really care or want to hear about what my actual experiences are.\n\nOther:  I've had sleep paralysis.  Hypnogogic phosphene that looked like a swarm of dots after a vivid dream about bees in my dorm sophomore year.  I think I've had Exploding head syndrome in the 3rd grade.  My older sister became \"disturbed\" back in '06, a few months after we got pet cats.  She claimed to be a psychic and said she experienced deja-vus.  Lastly, both me and my little sister heard lightning talking in 2017 but what my little sister doesn't know is that it was repeating one of the phrases I usually hear in my head.\n\nDo you think this is just hallucinations and a case of schizophrenia or could it be something more?\n\nI, for one, do not believe that I have schizophrenia.",

        "text": "Hi all,\nThis is my first post so be gentle. It could get long because all these years of suffering are coming out. \n\nI\u2019m a young doctor who lost her youth to a terrible suicidal depression from the age of around 11 (I\u2019m 29 now) Around 2 years ago psychotic symptoms started to creep in and slowly but strongly took away the scraps left by depression. \n\nWith the help of everything and nothing I finally got out of it. I want to make more sense of what happened to me for myself but mainly so that I\u2019d be able to provide the necessary resources and substances  to support people in similar situations out of suffering. \n\nI\u2019ve been through auditory hallucinations/ depersonalization/derealization/delusions/ (you name it most probably happened to me). I don\u2019t want to put a label on these things, in my experience the word schizophrenia does more harm than good. \n\nWhat I noticed is that alone the label \u201cschizophrenia\u201d and the shame that came with it made me shiver and made my hallucinations much worse. They started off as a distant neutral melody,  then slowly grew into this monster pushing and pulling my body, leaving me exhausted but unable to sleep. \nThe only thing more creepy and scary than the name schizophrenia was the idea of being announced \u201ccrazy\u201d, my liberty being taken away, me being strapped to bed and injected with haloperidol. \n \nThe pressure, fear and shame that was put on me by society and that I put on myself only seemed to make things much much much worse day by day.\n\nIn the past couple of days I\u2019ve been wondering what the end result would have been like if someone had told me from the beginning that these things might be consequences rather than causes of stress and if from the beginning I wouldn\u2019t have tried to push them away by any means. \n\nI\u2019m wondering how much stuff like the label schizophrenia is actually hurting not helping people. It\u2019s like a life sentence isn\u2019t it? \nFrom professional experience a lot of my patients don\u2019t even want to be treated. And as long as they can lead happy lives and in some cases even contribute to society, not hurting anyone, should they? \n\nCould it be possible that a big part of schizophrenia is this bubble of fear? I remember being diagnosed with depression, it felt like a huge relief. Finally something was found to be wrong with me. It\u2019s a totally different story for schizophrenia though\nIs it made much worse not by neurochemical changes in brain but because of the rejection, shame and helplessness people tend to feel together with the bad living circumstances triggering stress? \nThe hallucinations and other symptoms are definitely real.. I don\u2019t know..\nI would love to hear your comments and experience. \nPeace and love \u2764\ufe0f",

        "text": "I have just joined This forum while looking up reviews for abilify. My mom has been in denial of anything being wrong and will brush off her illness as a one time nervous breakdown. I am not sure if this is due to memory problems or lapses of memory when going through a psychotic episode, or denial perhaps because of Russian mental illness stigma. She will usually only acknowledge her hospitalization in 1996 as something but this week I told her how hard it has been for all of us. Yes I know the rule is that it\u2019s worse for the schizophrenic patient but it is really hard and is like losing someone. My mother would only agree to see a psychiatrist if he was a rabbi. I did a long online search and there was only one in the area, an hour and a half north of her but thank goodness she relented to seeing him after I told her what my childhood was like. It was really hard to admit all the pain. Eventhough she admitted through text messages that I was right about the episodes being recurring she still tried to tell the doctor that it was a one time thing. If anyone has any advice or stories on how they overcame this type or level of denial or how to deal with it that would be helpful. Finally after refusing medication even if it meant not getting to see me or my unborn daughter she somehow relented. She also tried to blame her problems on me not becoming a religious Jew like herself. I\u2019m not sure if she relented it because we told her it wouldn\u2019t be haloperidol which is what they gave her in the hospital or that I started crying. I was so afraid that she wouldn\u2019t get her medication if she refused. Today she picked it up and I FaceTimed her and she seemed to be in good spirits. She seemed to take it in front of me. I pray that this is how it will be moving forward. It was only 5 mg of abilify but we shall see. She\u2019s an artist and is afraid the drugs might make her too flat to make art but hopefully if the dose isn\u2019t too high it will not. The doctor diagnosed her with schizoaffective with mood swings. If anyone ha any advice on how to not lose your shit when people are in utter denial or how to overcome it if possible I appreciate it. Thank you all for being on here and sharing your experiences honestly and being so self aware and brave and responsible. You deserve a huge amount of respect.",

He has been acting very de oriented\u00a0 and confused till today.\nHe has been taken haloperidol, lithium carbonate, benztropine (for shaking cuz the lithium) and propanolol since like 3-4 years ago and he's been doing pretty good and focused. But since november his psychiatrist prescribed him metformin to lose some weight. \nHe stopped metformin on January when he started to get sick in case it was interacting with his other meds.\nThen on middle January his mom had to call to put him in the hospital inpatient room. He stayed there for one week and he came back home slightly better. But after couple of weeks he started to get confused again. I always made sure he was taking his meds properly.\nThen last week his mom put him in the inpatient again , he was there for 5 days then he came back and didn't improve at all.\nThis last time on the hospital they gave him an haloperidol injection that he has to get once a month, then benztropine pills twice a day, and 1 Haloperidol pill at bedtime. They didn't left clear if he has to take lithium, his last blood test in there shows lithium levels of over 1.5 , so on the toxic side. However on the blood test of his first time on the hospital his lithium level were very low of 0.2.\nI'm really confused why his meds don't seem to be working when they were fine for 3 years.\nHe has an follow up on next week and a psychiatrist appointment on April 16.\nThank you and sorry for my long testament. I would like to hear someone opinion.\n:)",

        "text": "Hi all, my father has paranoid schizophrenia and for the past few years I have been hearing sounds that arent there when I am waking up from sleep for the first 30 seconds or so. The sounds are things like birds chirping, very faint voices of my family and knocking on my door.  I know they arent real as this usually happens in the middle of the night when everyone is asleep and Im waking up (my sleep schedule is bad). Whenever I am fully awake I dont have any hallucinations at all. Im on haloperidol for tourettes syndrome so maybe this is masking the sounds in my head a little. So I was wondering if these are symptoms of early schizophrenia?",

I don't deserve that!\n\nI know, if you take your \"meds properly Everyday\" then you should be fine. But in my case it is just so severe I can't handle it anymore. \n\nReasons why I want to kill myself :\n\n- The severity of the symptoms. Fuck I hear voices EVERY SINGLE DAY since a few years. When I have insomnia it is not a mild insomnia, I can't sleep AT ALL for a few days, not even one minute!\n- It ruins my whole life, I cannot even work\n- MEDS don't work\u2026. For most people it works but for me\u2026 Let me explain. I have tried EVERY SINGLE med available on the market. EVERY SINGLE MED!!!! And believe me I was the kind of guy who took his meds every day and NEVER skipped a dose! I am also intolerant to some meds and for this reason I can't take them at all. I thought that the Clozapine was a \"miracle drug\" but even on clozapine I have voices. Less for sure but still\u2026 Now the worst thing? Right now I am not allowed to take psychiatric meds! Meds are slowly ruining my whole body (not paranoid about meds, they either cause me to suffocate or having tonic-clonic seizures\u2026 I do not have any \"Big Pharma\" delusion). I have asked my doctor if I could have some antipsychotic but he said no. Why? Epilepsy. But I am also anxious about taking meds because some meds make me even more psychotic, which is very weird, I know. Haloperidol makes my voices worse, the voices who are usually whispering are actually SCREAMING! Loxapine and risperidone make me depressed as fuck and not a single effect on voices. Amisulpride\u2026 oh amisulpride\u2026 The worst weeks on my life. I thought I was going nuts and kill myself. I have also tried to increase the meds with no effect at all. Even on 800 or 1000 mg I felt terrible. And I know that most people will not believe me \"meds are very effective\" \"you are just being paranoid\"... No. \n- Psych wards in my country are worst than jail. I don't want to spend my whole life in a psych ward. I even think you can have PTSD from this.\n\nYou want to tell me that \"I just need to go to the hospital\"? Well I am ALREADY at the hospital right now! I am writing from the hospital! Even the doctors don't really know what to do and I have seen a lot of doctors. Actually I see doctors every day and yet I cannot take meds because \"it would trigger a dangerous seizure\". \n\nI hate the idea of suicide. But I really have no hope. I have tried, tried and tried for years. Now I need to find peace.\n\nPlease do not tell me to \"exercise\", \"breathe\" or \"listening to music\", \"watching movies\" or anything like that, I have tried so many things\u2026",

But God may will that that falsehood-generation may stop. And then what will be your disease?\n\nAnd what will be left?\n\nI have reduced affect display. I pace, and I'll be confused the whole time I am not actively navigating. But I never generated falsehoods, and I never heard voices. My brain is the end-state schizophrenic brain, and that's where I was born.\n\nAnd I can tell you, the negative symptoms (and reduced affect display) of schizophrenia can be called the result of **conference**. It is neither an anxiety nor a depression: it simply says, you cannot stand to have dopamine AND serotonin (or adrenaline AND choline) at the same time.\n\nAnd to navigate, I gauge from my face, and from my transmitters A, D, S, and C.\n\nThere are two affects. One begins in the lower face, and hopes to proceed to the upper face. For receding into the lower face, it is the **adductive affect**. It is **Type A**.\n\nThe other begins in the upper face, and hopes to proceed to the lower face. For receding into the upper face, it is the **abductive affect**. And when it peels away from the lips, **Type B** loses the ability to drink soda.\n\nCan you spam them both at once? The top and bottom of your face?\n\nYou can't, can you? - and if you force your way upward, do you lose the ability to drink soda?\n\nI cannot speak for those folks who undergo schismatic blowouts, and who hear the voices I never knew. But I can successfully navigate the post-schismatic schizophrenic brain by taking tyrosine (D+), glycopyrrolate (C-), tianeptine (S-). And adrenaline is now part of my nature.\n\nThat makes a type A day. The next day will be Type B, with haloperidol (D-) for lack of amisulpride, prazosin (A-), choline from GNC (C+), and SSRI (S+), ideally fluvoxamine except it adversely affects haloperidol. Type B can be regrettable. It is dopey and rather fragile, and unlikely to stand up to a threat. But Type B is necessary, because Type A is unlikely to read a book.\n\nDon't you like to read books?",

(anyone have experience with that? are they normally accurate or way off?) but it seems like those are some of the least effective for her.\n\nso has anyone else had a similar experience? ",

I also take corticosteroids. \n\nIf I take an older antipsychotic than Abilify, it will cause other side-effects. And how could I have a job on antipsychotics?

        "text": "So during the last year I began a long road away from medication and did so quite successfully for a long time. Drop dosage here, a quit there. Things were going great and I just assumed that only drugs could make me fall back into paranoid delusions. But as life crisis and stress began to wear me down I found myself not laughing as much, sleeping horribly with night sweats that would drench the bed. As a result I started doing drugs again and shamefully enough started smoking weed again (my biggest nono). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a short episode or two I created problems for those around me that weren't even problems, started suspecting odd things but still thought everything was fine since voices weren't so intrusive. But eventually I was back in the hospital after just walking around in catatonia for the longest time, which I'm sorry to say affected my romantic relationship quite badly, at a time were I needed to be strong and stable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo got put back on meds, regular meals and not too long after that (only a week or so) I started ignoring delusional and paranoid thoughts. Was able to regain eye contact with people I spoke with and could think logically which meant a lot of internal stress washed away. I know things could have become much worse before I was hospitalized and I'm glad I got sent in before it all went too south. But I know I have a little ways to go before I can become myself again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy biggest and first episode taught me how things are and what to look out for when things have become really bad. But this time I realized I need to stay vigilant in seeing where the shoe fits so to speak. As I'm quite young I know there will be bumps in the road before I know myself and the disorder by heart. But I'm kinda glad this happened, just so I could learn from it. So to all of you with a sinking doubt of anxiety and oddly logical delusions, take your meds. Not just one day but keep at it for a while until things start to make sense. Thanks if you made it this far, reddit is sort of half ramble, half therapy for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope everyone's weekend is going good, glad to be a part of this sub.",

        "text": "Hello, I've been a lurker for awhile now and thought I'd step out and introduce myself.\n\nI'm 26 and from the UK, I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in January 2016 after being sectioned. Prior to being diagnosed I had had various diagnoses including bipolar, bpd, OCD, recurrent depression and ptsd. I had been in various medication including a couple of antipsychotics. \n\nIt all started when my CPN had suspected for a long time that I was hearing voices, although I was completely unaware of it and asked me outright what I could hear. I said I could hear him and 5 people outside talking about me. There was no one outside. That's how I became acquainted with Olanzapine. But only 2.5mg. That was in September 2015. By December I had taken myself off of my tiny dose of Olanzapine and my 200mg of Lamotrigine. This worried the CMHT. I never keep it a secret when I come off my meds but I will only tell when asked. So yes, I am a bit crafty. By January I was in a proper psychosis and as I mentioned earlier I was sectioned. I was put straight on 15mg of Olanzapine, told I had all the classic symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and that after going through all of my notes the Dr theorised that my prodromal phase started when I was about 17. In his report for the tribunal the Dr was highly critical of the mental health team and suggested that intervention had been missed on numerous occasions. I was discharged by tribunal after 2 weeks.\n\nOlanzapine was great for my positive symptoms but it made me very anxious, restless and fat. So I switched to Amisulpride (omfg it was awful). I was hospitalised again in June 2016 and put on Aripiprazole (amazing) but cleverly decided I didn't need it and was promptly sectioned again in September 2016. I was recommenced on Aripiprazole (maintena) and my section 3 was converted to a community treatment order. In February 2017 I was recalled to hospital because the Aripiprazole wasn't working I was there for 2 months this time and put on Clozapine. I stayed mentally well for awhile but physically was a wreck. A very helpful GP (not mine) told me to stop taking Clozapine. I knew I shouldn't of but felt so awful it gave me a good excuse to stop it. What ensued was hell but I managed to avoid hospital by going on Flupentixol depot. Up until recently I've just bumbled along but became ill again. How I wasn't sectioned again I'll never know, there was talk of it. Was coaxed into taking 10mg of Haloperidol by my psychiatrist and have bounced back surprisingly well for someone who has been labelled as treatment resistant. My depot has now been changed to Haldol and I'm starting to feel much better. \n\nSorry for such a long post. It looks like I've got the verbal shits. Anyway I take a cocktail of Haloperidol, Chlorpromazine, Vortioxetine and Clonazepam for my mental health. Oh and I'm female. \n\nTl;dr 26. F. Paranoid Schizophrenia. Various sections. Various meds. Taking Haloperidol. Feeling a bit better now.",

I'm a very intelligent and philosophical person, and I take the time to figure things out for myself, work things out for myself. I'm sure other people could benefit from therapy, but I'll share with you my technique. By the way, when doing research on medicine, try checking them out on RxList for dosage guidelines. It's a nice website to use. \n\n**Step One \\~ Reflection:**\n\nTo be quite frank with you, I don't care much about diagnoses. You know what you deal with on a daily basis better than anyone. If you can't put a label to certain feelings, or why certain things are happening, do some research. Do you have psychosis in the absence of mood episodes? Is it only during an episode? Be reflective; look at the past, look at the present, figure out why things are happening, under what circumstances they're happening. Maybe keep a journal? When you're feeling some type of way, try to write what brought it on, try to write about the circumstances at the time. Were you really tired at the time? If you were, did it exacerbate the symptoms significantly? Are these symptoms happening for a long period of time under normal circumstances? Just be reflective in general. I consider this part to be the most important part. Taking time to deeply reflect, journal things as they're happening, or after they've happened. Once you get to the root of your problems, you can go from there. If it's a persistent problem significantly effecting your life, you'll probably need medicine. Besides that, YOU have to put in a lot of work, too. It's not just the medicine's responsibility to fix all your problems. \n\nWant my advice? Go with the flow, live in the moment, and do you naturally. Don't dwell on shit, just LIVE. You are RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW. The past has gone and the future is yet to come. All you can do is choose what to do with the current moment. Literally everything is a choice, if you think about it. You are the only one responsible for your destiny. You are the only one responsible for controlling your actions and reactions in life. If you're going through a hard time, you CAN control your reaction to it. Sure, you might feel bad, but dwelling on it and refusing to move on, isn't going to help. So, go with the flow, live in the moment, and do you. Regardless of what type of person you are, or what you believe in, just do you. It doesn't matter if society disagrees with your way of life, what you are, or what you do; fuck them. It's your life, and only your life. So, be who you are naturally, and don't hold back. Why be afraid of people judging you? Sure, they might judge you, but FIGHT BACK. Why be so focused on trying to please others? Please yourself and take care of yourself FIRST. Do you FOR you. I'll give you an example: I really like to be barefoot. If someone sees me barefoot and they think, \"Wow. That guy is weird, that guy is gross.\", good for them. They have the right to their sheep minded opinions. If they'd try to call me out on it though, I'd say, \"Wow. I think it's pretty self\\-centered of you to think I give a fuck about your opinion. I don't even know you, and you expect me to live a way you approve of?\" \\~ If they'd ask me why I'm barefoot, I'd say \"Why are you wearing shoes?\". Dumbfuck questions get dumbfuck answers. I'm barefoot obviously because I decided not to put shoes on. You get my train of thought? You just gotta do you and LIVE. Your personal happiness is your right; don't let anyone take that away from you.\n\n**Step Two \\~ Medication:**\n\nAt this point, you should have taken time to reflect, research, and find the root of your problems. Honestly, diagnoses are kind of irrelevant in my personal opinion. What I consider to be the best treatment, is a symptom focused approach. Get to the root of the problem, get medicated if you need medication, and continue to go with the flow and use every moment to grow stronger; use every moment as a learning opportunity. Knowledge is good, but putting knowledge into action, is wisdom. Think of your plans and research for medicine as a constantly changing rough draft. If it doesn't work, go back to the drawing board and come up with a plan B. Are you on a SSRI but still not having the results you want? Consider upping the dose, changing the medicine, or augmenting it with a different medication. \n\nI deal with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, ADHD \\- Combined Type, and Persistent Depressive Disorder, that much is 100&#37; for sure. On top of that, I either have Schizoaffective Disorder \\- Depressive Type, or Schizotypal Personality Disorder. Honestly, I have so many fucking problems, it's really hard to put a finger on what exactly my diagnoses should be. So, I just take a symptom based approach rather than trying to figure the differences out. Too much overlap. \n\nI recently went to a psychiatrist a couple months ago for basically the first time in my life \\(besides when I was tested for ADHD as a kid\\). I always refused medication and help, but yeah... I need it now, lol. Right now I'm on Venlafaxine and Atomoxetine. Previously, I was on Guanfacine, Buspirone, Hydroxyzine, Atomoxetine, and Lamotrigine. There's so many interactions between all that shit, it's literally ridiculous. Not to mention, I literally had no reason to be on Lamotrigine. I don't have bipolar disorder, I have ADHD!!! The Buspirone did absolutely nothing, the Hydroxyzine was interacting with pretty much everything and making me feel like shit. I had no reason to be on Guanfacine and Atomoxetine at the same time, I mean seriously, holy shit lol. Ever since that first meeting, I've been going to him and telling him what I want and why I want / need it, and basically just being my own psychiatrist. It's working out pretty good, lol. Like I said, you know yourself better than anyone! Don't put up with bullshit, do it yourself! Some of these doctors are literally just fucking quacks. You really have to take them with a grain of salt, and do research on your own part. That's where taking into account the risk / reward ratio of the medicine you're taking comes into play.\n\nSo, my cocktail is going to be:  Venlafaxine 150mg, Atomoxetine 80mg, and Olanzapine 10mg after my next meet \\~\\~ If the Olanzapine starts giving me too much trouble, I'm going to look for a good alternative. If I decide the risk / reward is worth it though, I'll keep the Olanzapine and add Topiramate 100mg \\(depending on how the Olanzapine effects me\\). \\~\\~ Before you even get into choosing a SSRI / SNRI, antipsychotics, ADHD medicine, or anything of the like, you need to focus on one thing: **Risk / Reward**. You need to choose what you take wisely; aim for the most effective medicine possible, that treats as many problems of yours as possible, with as little interactions as possible, and as little side effects as possible. Medicines can interact in a positive way, as well. For example, some antipsychotics are better than others in dealing with negative symptoms. Therefore instead of increasing your SSRI to a crazy level and risking more side effects, or adding another SSRI and adding more interactions, consider perhaps another antipsychotic that's better at dealing with the negative symptoms than the one you're on. Or upping your antipsychotic dose if it's a low dose? Remember, you have soooo many options with all the medicine out there nowadays. Just be smart and focus on Risk / Reward, consider all alternatives!\n\nAnyways, I'm going to give you the process I used to figure out the drug cocktail I'm going to get on soon. I don't know if this will help anyone, but I hope it does. \n\nDo you have ADHD like me, but also need to be on an antipsychotic? That means you can't take stimulants because of interactions. Which means you'd have to take the Atomoxetine \\+ Antipsychotic combo. The Atomoxetine could take care of the inattentive side of things, the antipsychotic would undoubtedly take care of the hyperactivity side of things. Anyways, knowing that, Atomoxetine is the #1 medicine on my list, as it's a pill I really need. So, I'm going to build around that pill and choose the SSRI / SNRI & antipsychotic combos that have as few interactions and side effects as possible, balancing that risk / reward.\n\nI checked out the SSRIs and SNRIs on that list and googled all of them, checking what symptoms they treat. After picking through it, I wound up with 5 or 6 that would treat treat the Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Depression. Then, I took each pill and ran it through the [drugs.com](https://drugs.com) interaction checker, and was left only with Venlafaxine. Why? All those other pills had MAJOR interactions with the Atomoxetine. Like I said, just try to focus on balancing out the risk / reward. I'm very satisfied with my choice of Venlafaxine; it's 78&#37; more effective than placebo as stated earlier, so the numbers look good too, which is always nice.\n\nSo. I'm currently taking Atomoxetine and Venlafaxine. I've seen some improvement on my inattentive symptoms, but I'd like more. I'm going to wait on bumping the Atomoxetine up to 100mg until I get the other medicine straight, though. See, another thing to consider with medicine, is how they'll do working together. Both the Venlafaxine and Olanzapine will have effects on my ADHD. Therefore, I'm going to see how those two effect my ADHD before upping my Atomoxetine dose \\(once again, risk / reward\\). I've had persistent and debilitating depression ever since I was like, 4 or 5 years old. The 75mg of Venlafaxine isn't cutting it. I've noticed that it is helping a bit, but once again, I need more. This is what I was talking about when referencing a \"constantly changing rough draft\". You just have to take it one step at a time, and think smart. Knowing where I'm at right now, my plans are to increase my dose of Venlafaxine to 150mg. This should help with the ADHD, help with the depression, and ease the anxiety even more. Okay. So, at this point I've got a solid plan. Atomoxetine 80mg, Venlafaxine 150mg. Now, I need to add an antipsychotic to the list. Going through the list of antipsychotics, it's really sad how little efficiency most have vs placebo. Currently with the Atomoxetine & Venlafaxine combo, I've got the choice between Luraisdone and Olanzapine. All the other ones have very bad interactions with Atomoxetine & Venlafaxine. Anyways, the Olanzapine should work really good with the Venlafaxine to basically kill the depression and anxiety. I hope so anyways, I'm kind of hesitant to up Venlafaxine all the way up to 225. Considering at that dose Venlafaxine starts effecting dopamine, I don't think it'd be a good idea \\(antipsychotic interaction\\). But yeah, guys. Check [drugs.com](https://drugs.com) interaction checker for all your medicine. Google it too. Ie Venlafaxine and Olanzapine. Check which receptors drugs effect, see if there's conflicts the interaction checker missed. See if there's opposing mechanisms. Just, do research. It's better safe than sorry. Remember, you need to balance out risk / reward as much as you can. \n\nThe plan is simply to be on Atomoxetine, Venlafaxine, and Olanzapine. If the negative side effects of Olanzapine become too much though, I've got multiple options. I could add the Topiramate, or switch to the Lurasidone. The third route is switching to a less effective SSRI / SNRI. I could also always use two SSRIs if needed. And if I change SSRI, that means I possibly have more antipsychotic alternatives. If it really came down to it, I could just cut out the Atomoxetine and then having way more freedom of choice. This just goes to show you, you always have options. Just take it one step at a time, do lots of research, and balance risk / reward. You'll find the perfect combo for you :\\)\n\nI know this was a REALLLLLYYYY drawn out post, but I hope it helps you guys. Remember, think for yourself and take control of your own life, YOU CAN DO THIS!",

        "text": "uhh.. i started writing that but it just got longer and longer, i try to tl;dr it on the end.\n\nI have a relatively complex case of paranoid schizophrenia, while at first i was misdiagnosed a bunch of times (depression->bipolar->schizophrenia pathway, mainly because i heavily mistrust the government which also provides healthcare here so i am not 100% honest with them) i had this confirmed (mainly to see if it was not something less serious that would not disqualify from 3/4th of the jobs in my country) by private psychiatrists (whom i gave more access to me) which all put me into schizoaffective/schizophrenia spectrum and possibly danger to myself and others. All also diagnosed something else like Paranoid Personality Disorder, PTSD (by most of them) and something they coin \"Paedophile OCD\". I am happy with the diagnosis process of all, they took their time and i was able to cross-evaluate them, against the government and against a psychiatrist in a nearby country which did satisfy my paranoia/delusions that this is just some government plot. I burned a lot of money on this (around 10000EUR) and am now essentially bankrupt after i lost my job as well, i was pretty well off before that.\n\nI was hospitalised a few times, mostly by my own decision, 2 times by force, once i threatened to shoot people (and had access to weapons) and police got me (lucky that i was not shot). Both this times they fed me anti psychotics and i talked my way out of the ward after 2-3 weeks.\n\nMy parents both have schizophrenia (my father violent, my mother projecting), i was sexually abused as child. I had no dangerous symptoms until ~20, starting with depression and paranoia, i had unmedicated ADHD as child and back then (now that i think about it) also already delusions, i was taken from my mother and lived in gov care from around 10-17 which was not that bad actually. I never got to \"love\" staff there like family (and neither one of the other children in a romantical sense) and became rather cool with feelings, by now i have not much of them at all anymore. I lack \"empathy\" for humans (i could not care less if someone dies in front of me, friend/family or not, despite having depression issues myself i have zero understanding for others with it and so on, i also morbidly enjoy watching people die) but have much for animals. I do not have much feelings for anything, though i do 'love' my cat in some sense. I have a girlfriend and feelings for her, but internally it is also a \"business arrangement\" that fulfils our needs (sexually and romantically), i don't think my 'love' goes much further than that ever, it works pretty good and is not something i would complain about.\n\nI still live with a very high mistrust in government but can manage that, it also gives me a great feeling to rip them off with getting unemployment and disability money for doing absolutely nothing. I have less paranoia than before and \"just\" assume that my phone and internet is monitored, no more issues with things like mind reading and more extreme government things like satellites and mind control drugs. This got better \bin the last years.\n\nAt first i had only some suicidal thoughts, this later increased to what i would call \"suicidal tendencies\" and now is a daily occurrence, i think about jumping from bridges when i walk over them and to sleep i think about jumping from a specific building and the outcome of that. I'm not that much worried about this considering the next point, my homicidal thoughts. I like to think about blowing stuff up or shooting people very much, pretty much for no reason. Even i can see that this is very bad thinking, but i'm not sure what to do about it.\n\nLikely due to the abuse i have some shameful tendencies considering the age of girls i think about, i'm not talking extreme areas here but still far more than one ever should think about (no, i clearly lie here, it is extreme, but i will not state the exact age range to not upset anyone). I have precautions to avoid situations with children younger than 15+ in any case. I do not want any children (solely due to this) and do not have contact with any family members that have any younger children. I would likely never act on it but i still have the extreme fear that i might do when given an opportunity. I'm pretty disgusted by this but see no way to change it. I do have a normal sexual orientation as well (in the area of bisexuality) so this is not an exclusive interest. (Even just writing that already makes me feel disgusted and like killing myself)\n\nI do have medication. I was on nearly any available anti psychotic in my country on sometimes sick doses (1g+ Seroquel, 40mg Abilify, 40mg Zyprexa, 30mg Haloperidol and so on) with almost no effects. Most did not even have much side effects. I take Wellbutrin for depression symptoms which works sometimes and sometimes does not. The dose of that is also very high (600mg). For some time i had benzodiazepines which worked good for some things but cannot obtain it anymore. I am med compliant and take them daily as prescribed, sometimes times vary but i keep it within the first hours after i wake up.\n\nObviously i have a \"trusted\" psychiatrist that knows all this but he cannot do more than switching meds, changing doses or send me to the ward which is not very effective. I tried therapy with multiple therapists but i just don't buy what they tell me, it sounds idiotic to me, like they talk about feelings and i simply can't follow. After some time i start to manipulate them to avoid telling them things about me (especially the abuse and paedophilia thing, but i rather tell them that than that i think about murdering people) as i see it simply as none of their business and have no interest in getting judged by them, they also take notes which are not very much secured and i have major fears that something out of this could leak in some way. I also see no way why it would help to tell them that things if they can't do anything to help me anyway. I can't afford it anymore either.\n\nAt this point i am not sure how to continue, while not nice my live is sort of secure. I have an \"income\" and a place to stay, i have internet, a cat and gf but still all of that does not really matter to me, it is just nothing. Most of the time i think i rather should live permanently in the ward and not in the normal world, i'm clearly an insane danger to people around me but i cannot afford that and have no one to take care of my cat and gf.\n\ntl;dr schizophrenia, POCD, abuse, not sure how to continue\n",

I had been prescribed everything from Haloperidol (Haldol), Lurasidone (Latuda), Risperidone (Risperidol), Clozapine, Aripiprazole (Abilify), Ziprasidone (Geodon), Chlorpromazine (Thorazine), and probably others I cannot remember. Several of these were short-term to see their efficacy while others I took for longer. Geodon was the medication I was on the longest.\n\nOver the past several years I have had serious problems with my teeth. Tooth care has never been an issue for me - I take good care of them. However, it seems the integrity of my teeth are horrendous. I have had several root canals, pulled teeth (followed by having implants and crowns put in), cavities, and now I have a tooth that is basically crumbling out of my mouth. I cannot come up with any reason for having such poor teeth to anything but having taken the above medications for a long time. My family have run-of-the-mill dental issues but nothing like what I have, so I have all but ruled out genetics. This issue is causing me real anguish and serious depressed states because I feel like there is nothing I can do, no matter how well I take care of my teeth.\n\nDoes anyone else have any similar problem? Especially those who have taken medication for prolonged periods of time? If anyone does have a similar issue are you managing it somehow?\n\nThanks :)",

In my experience after some stability the dose will be reduced and if that stability continues it can continue decreasing until you find a good balance between symptoms and side effects. They may also need to change the meds. I would also ask if atypicals (the newer antipsychotics) have been tried as they often have less risk of side effects. Good luck I hope you can get an appointment soon. I haven\u2019t been on the haloperidol or researched it\u2019s maximum dose, so can\u2019t say for that drug specifically sorry.",

        "comment": "I take those exact two meds.  When I was at the highest dose (15mg /day as I recall) I took it at night, and would sometimes be kind of obtunded for the early part of the next day.  Propranolol doesn\u2019t exactly help this (makes it slightly worse) but does help the akasthesia.  One thing you can do is have him take 300-600mg of vitamin B6 a day.  This is shown to be as effective as propranolol for akasthesia in studies.  Talk to your doctor but you might be able to reduce the propranolol dosage.  The main culprit is the Haldol.  I take a lower dose now (7.5mg a day) and don\u2019t have as much in the way or sedation.  I think the sedating effect wears off with time, so with more time on Haldol, it slows you down less.  Lastly, you might research high-dose CBD.  This is single-handedly responsible for my being able to slowly get off Haldol.  There are studies showing it is a natural antipsychotic and as effective as some APs.  But your results may vary.  Be sure to clear everything with the doc.",

        "comment": "\n\nTruth is, some improvement will probably happen as he adjusts to the medication, but by that time it may be harder to come off of it, though shaving 50% off of 20 isn't as hard as going from 5 to 2, for instance, because there's a diminishment of degree of effect in a nonlinear fashion as you increase the dose (the first two mg are doing basically 80% of what the drug is capable of doing). \n\n(Don't believe me?\n\n \"Our findings demonstrate that 2-5 mg/day of haloperidol, which usually leads to plasma levels of 1-2 ng/ml, would be expected to induce 60-80% dopamine D2 receptor occupancy.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9201802/#:~:text=Our%20findings%20demonstrate%20that%202,80%25%20dopamine%20D2%20receptor%20occupancy. )\n\n2 mg does basically all the drug is capable of doing. Anything more than that is just a last ditch effort to get some kind of clinical response (in short, sedation and manageability), made in situation where you're already using a drug that is considered something of a last resort.\n\n\nDoses that high of that particular drug aren't used unless either the doctor is highly irresponsible, or the patient was highly agitated and/or manic and resistant to treatment with other interventions.\n\nIn essence, most of that dosage is effectively there for sedation purposes only. Some might quibble with me a bit on that point, arguing that 5ht2a antagonism doesn't kick in until higher doses, but none of the supposed effects of such (decrease in negative symptoms, decrease in extra pyramidal side effects, even *maybe* a positive effect on cognition - all kind of theoretical, since we only very recently have developed a drug that does this in isolation, and the fact that it's use hasn't taken off like wildfire might possibly tell you something) matter at all when the patient is basically a fucking zombie.\n\n\nSo, as scientifically speaking as I can muster, I would say that you should only consider keeping him on that dose if you are afraid of what he might do if he were less sedated.\n\nBecause of the way the drug, and most AP drugs, work, you may not even see a huge change until you get down to the last few milligrams.\n\nHaloperidol has less of an adverse effect on metabolism than the newer drugs, but its long term use is more likely to lead to permanent movement disorders which are potentially uncomfortable, expensive to treat, and correlate with additional cognitive impairment.\n\nIn short, unless he is a serious danger to himself and others without being sedated, you should make a plan, preferably with a medical professional, to get him onto something less likely to be harmful as quickly as possible.\n\nA 25% reduction with a pill splitter is not insane at all, and if that works out alright, another quarter isn't insane either.\n\nIf he does in fact need to be sedated continuously, there are better, less potentially harmful options you can discuss with his doctor.\n\nHopefully this was only something needed to get him through a rough patch and a more workable solution can be found soon.\n\nGood luck.",

        "comment": "That is not how drug availability works. u/visionsofrust's comment is correct in stating the intramuscular thresholds.\n\nIf you're talking about oral, the threshold for haloperidol is (also) 100mg/day, but the threshold for ziprasidone is 160mg/day. Unless you are secretly a mouse who figured out how to use Reddit, the dosages you are describing are nowhere near an 'overdose,' even if your weight is in the double-digits.\n\nIt seems as though you are discounting *why* you were in the hospital in the first place (benzo + barbiturate withdrawals). I dunno if you thought just white-knuckling coming off benzos *and* barbiturates at the same time was gonna be some fun, whimsical adventure, but that was beyond stupid. I've heard that experience described as \"a nightmare\" even on its own. That makes legitimately everything worse. The cocktail shot will *sedate* you, but haloperidol + lorazepam is actually a pretty standard treatment for catatonia- if you went catatonic, that would have helped. You seem like you are extremely sensitive to antipsychotics and experienced some rather severe *sedation.* Even the most severe of sedation is not catatonia, that's an entirely separate phenomenon.\n\nAltogether, what you were given was not deviation from the standard of care. If you wanted to criticize what the hospital did, the fact that they seem to have only addressed your withdrawals with IM lorazepam is... not ideal.",

There is an admitted patient that I have been following up on for the past 10 days (under supervision of attending of course). It's a 84 yr old male with dementia. He has QTc prolongation (always above 540 ms) even after removing QT prolonging drugs. We are stuck with using options that have minimal QT effects. He developed hyperammonemia with Valproate when we tried that(resolved after stopping it). Benzodiazepine showed worsening of agitation when tried a few times. We started him on Aripiprazole (due to low risk of QT prolongation) and have been increasing dose slowly. He is also on PRN Olanzapine 2.5 Q4H but everyday he's needed 4-5 doses and primary team has had no choice but to use dexmedetomidine drip. They have him on this drip for past 5 days increasing and decreasing the rate as needed. Obviously patient cannot be on this forever since the plan will be to discharge to dementia facility. \nWe did consider Akathisia but I do not see any objective signs and patient is too confused to provide information. We are trying to think of alternate diagnostic possibilities and medications. We initially suspected Lewy Body but it seemed less likely as we followed up. Briefly we also considered NMS but then there were insufficient signs and it is difficult to ascertain currently.\nWhat's odd is that when he presented 10 days ago, he was pleasant and had no delirium signs in the morning. Only at night he would show sundowning and get agitated. However the last 4 days, he's confused and agitated all the time. The way this progressed is concerning. I did consider that the constant high/low Dexmedetomidine and on/off sedation messed with his circadian rhythm but then it still leaves us baffled as to what to do next. The attending also agrees that this case is difficult given our limited options.\nAny suggestions?\n\nWish I could have phrased the details better but hope it came across.",

        "text": "PGY-1 on an IM rotation at an OSH.  As it's Psych adjacent I got a somewhat challenging case dumped in my lap and I'm struggling to handle it without any of my Psych seniors or attendings to turn to.  Part of the struggle is that I have a number of complicated patients and don't have the time to actually dive  into the patient psych history and gather collateral.  Additionally I seem to be caught in the middle of a finger pointing turf war between Psych and Neuro -- and neither service seems particularly sharp or have bothered to do a proper investigation. \n\nBriefly \\~70 yo who received anesthesia \\~ 4 months ago and within a day or two began undergoing pretty drastic, progressive changes -- with 48 hours expressing SI, and significantly increased anxiety and progressive difficulty with memory.  Patient was treated at an inpatient facility that no-one has bothered to get records for and started on unknown medications.  Continued worsening until \\~ 1 week ago when he was admitted to a sister hosptial's inpatient ward. Notes from that admission are unrevealing as the patient was deemed unable to have a meaningful interview due to neurocognitive decline.  I haven't had the time to piece together the exact medications but it appears they were trialed on mirtazapine with quetiapine PRNs for agitation with Trazodone for sleep before coming to us on 10mg Escitalopram and 5mg Buspar.   About 5 days ago patient had orthostatic hypotension and was transferred to my hospital and I came on service 3 days ago.  Iniitally no psychotropic changes other than haloperidol 5mg PRN for agitation. \n\nWorkup here has consisted of LP and MRI w/wo contrast which have so far been unrevealing. Psychiatry has claimed this is primarily neurologic (rapidly progressive dementia) Neurology believed this to be primary psychiatric (severe anxiety, or possibly prion) until 3 days ago when they decided the patient has serotonin syndrome on the basis of tremor and hyperreflexia (+3 in patellar and achilles, +2 elsewhere).  Neurology also noticed for the first time clonus at ankle.  I had low suspicion but recognized that I have limited experience, that Serotonin syndrome can have a varied presentation, and that neurology would not engage in further attempts to find differentials without running down this lead reluctantly followed their recommendations. Buspar has been stopped for two days and Escitalopram is now down to 5mg and will be stopped by week end.  Against my better judgement given age, patient is now on 2mg Diazepam PO BID with 2mg IM PRN for agitation (which has not been needed).  There has been no improvement in neurological or psychiatric symptoms.   \n  \nToday, Neurology forced me to call poison control for further treatment recommendations (who also expressed skepticism and did not recommend any changes), and further diagnosed patient with catatonia.  Which...may actually be the case as Neurology reported posturing  and rigidity (I had not observed either), but leaves me unsure how to proceed. I am surprised that the diazepam has at best had no improvement, and at worst may have precipitated this, but I also know that significant amounts of benzos can be required for treatment so lack of improvement doesn't necessarily signify anything.   \n\n I plan to do a Bush Francis tomorrow to see for myself, but it will be my first time performing one.  My understanding is that as long as any two of the criteria are scored that a catatonia diagnosis can be made and further evaluation is for severity. Is that a correct understanding?  Beyond that, I have read that in geriatric populations as little as .5mg Ativan can be used for a challenge (I am unsure if I would even be allowed to perform at this hospital) and that Zolpidem may have some efficacy as a challenge drug as well. How do you all go about diagnosing catatonia in the, especially hospitalized, geriatric population? ",

I was just reading an article *Combining Aripiprazole and Haloperidol: Focus on D2 Receptor* in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and it mentions \"Conversely, the addition of haloperidol to aripiprazole may yield a stronger D2 blockade and subsequently an improvement of positive symptoms, while at same time potentially reduce some of the benefits of aripiprazole's atypicality, namely, its activity on serotoninergic and dopaminergic transmission (dopamine D2/D3 partial agonism, serotonin 5-HT1A agonism, 5-HT2A antagonism).\" Can someone explain why the addition of haloperidol to patient on aripiprazole would have different effects than the addition of aripiprazole to a pt on a stable haloperidol regimen?

I'm PhD-student in psychiatry  and I want to share with you some thoughts about the gap in basic diagnostic approaches and treatment between postsoviet space and western world. This idea occurred when I was working on the project related to catatonia.\n\nIn practice:\n\n1. We use ICD-10 classification. Anybody knows hardly anything about DSM. We typically use traditional diagnostic rules to make diagnosis and than trying to find congruent code in ICD-10. That's why, we have a lot of diagnosis like \"pfropfschizophrenia\" (german term to nominate mix of schizophrenia and mental retardation).\n\n2. We don't know what is catatonia. We have \"catatonic syndrome\" that can occure only in case of catatonic form of schizophrenia or rarely in case of organic impairment. Our psychiatry do not \"belive\" in catatonic syndrome in affective/conversive disorders. We treat catatonic syndrome by antipsychotic drugs. No benzodiazepines, ECT is hardly limited.\n\n3. We strongly recognize OCD as neurotic pathology. But this diagnosis is extremely rare. I have hypothesis that some cases that western psychiatry recognizes as OCD, in our community understood as a syndrome of psychic automatism and respectively qualified in a context of paranoid schizophrenia.\n\n4. Benzodiazepines prescription is hardly limited. Only BDZP drug that you can prescribe relatively easy is gidazepam (I know that you don't know what it is). Only BDZP that could be used as acute sedative is diazepam (Valium) and it's prescription is controled as strictly as morphins. No lorazepam or clonazepam at all.\n\n5. No psychostimulators. Attention deficiency disorder is treated individually: sometimes with low doses of haloperidol, sometimes with anticonvulsants.\n\nI understand that it could sound weird, but our patients get well and this system is working in its own way. The problem hiding in nominations, classifications and drug limitations. I hope that one day we will build the bridge between our professional communites and approaches. \n\nPlease, share your thoughts. \n\nSorry for my low language skills.\n",

I was wondering about my options for when traditional Clozapine augmentations fail.\n\nIf my tx refractory psychotic patient fails an adequate trial of clozapine, I generally try to augment with a potent D2 blocker (for example, Haloperidol 5mg qHS or Risperidone 2mg BID), or a partial agonist (for example Aripiprazole 20mg qAM or Cariprazine 3mg qHS). If both of these fail then generally I try one of the traditional mood stabilizers (for Lithium Carbonate and Divalproex Sodium I get to acceptable plasma concentrations, for Lamotrigine I generally titrate to 200mg.)\n\nI don't have too many patients end up failing all of these augmentations, but I am curious what I could do for those select few. ECT is an option I suppose, although my experience with ECT has been frustrating to say the least because of pushback from insurance. Another option would be to titrate off the Clozapine and try high dose Olanzapine, I've tried 30mg to 40mg and have not seen much success.\n\nIs there anything else I could do for these patients?

I know psychiatry is always a per-patient basis, so if you guys could just name the most common rationales used, that would be awesome to help me work more efficiently with you all in the future :)\n\n1. Antipsychotic polypharmacy in a case that is all but clozapine-resistant schizophrenia\n\n2. Using medications with less evidence for efficacy and/or less tolerability than standard medications besides the reason of cost (e.g. oxcarbazepine over lamotrigine and haloperidol over quetiapine or aripiprazole for bipolar mania or depression)\n\n3. Prescribing a patient more than 2 medications as initial pharmacotherapy in the absence of multiple comorbidities\n\nThank you for your honest inputs!",

If a patient has been trialed on a second-generation drug or two without success, Haldol might be useful next. A patient with already significant metabolic syndrome for whom the metabolic side effects of a second-gen might be worse than the risk for EPS on Haldol would also be a good candidate too.",

If I had to take an antipsychotic I would rather take haldol than zyprexa, seroquel, or risperdal, the former two of which can cause major metabolic issues and the latter of which can cause huge sexual problems. Off the top of my head how haldol\u2019s effect on prolactin compares to risperdal, but anecdotally I\u2019ve had fewer haldol patients complain of sexual issues than risperdal patients.",

There aren't that many second-generation antipsychotic agents (I can only think of olanzapine which I've never prescribed because you get all the downsides with olanzapine with none of the benefits of a depot injection) left if you want to be able to give a depot injection.\n\nAt the end of the day I think the real answer is \"because it works\".",

Statistically speaking, most healthcare workers who are assaulted are victims of reactive violence (get punched by an angry patient), not instrumental violence (get beat up at home by an ex-patient laying in wait for them). \n\nOn the flipside, these threats should be taken seriously. Working in this field, your patient population has a much higher rate of acting on threats than the general patient population. \n\nSteps you can take: \n\n*  Report the threat. \n* Transfer care, stop seeing the patient. Make it clear to your supervisor that you are not comfortable after an explicit threat has been made to you. Do this in writing (send an email). You've now made it their problem because if you're assaulted after this, they are liable. Supervisors/managers are risk-averse, they'll work a lot harder to transfer the patient when they realize they could be liable for a bad outcome.\n* Use Optery and Deleteme. They will scrub your personal info from the internet. \n* Get a gun. I don't care where you fall on the politics of 2nd amendment rights, you need to be able to defend yourself if an ex-patient shows up at your doorstep. I have a concealed carry permit and so do many forensic psychiatrists I know. I know at least one who is alive today because he was carrying a gun when a former patient showed up to kill him. \n* This is going to be controversial but I know several forensic psychiatrists who don't vote. If you register to vote, your address is findable on the internet. There's no way around that. I voted this year only because I'm moving from my current residence in a few months, otherwise I would not have voted.",

        "comment": "I work in forensic psych (LCSW). Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n1.) How long is this person going to be incarcerated? If they\u2019re getting out soon, Duty to Warn/Tarasoff laws may apply (depends on where you live), so if facility staff are aware and the person\u2019s statements are credibly threatening, facility staff should alert you. I would check in with the social worker working on aftercare planning to report your concerns and to request to be notified of discharge, if possible. Is this person going to remain in custody for a significant amount of time? If so, it\u2019s more likely than not the person will have forgotten what he said. \n\n2.) A lot of these folks can verbally fly off the handle in the moment when provided unfavorable news, so is this just something that came out of his mouth and soon he\u2019ll be able to acknowledge that was a highly inappropriate thing to say? If so, reporting it to law enforcement for charges might make things worse and put a larger target on you if this person truly means what he says. I am by no means trying to dissuade you into making a report, since you need to do what makes YOU feel best. \n\n3.) The fact that you\u2019re converting meds to IMs due to noncompliance with orals and his decreased behavioral stability (aggression) makes me think he\u2019s maybe not truly as psychiatrically stable as you might think? Could there possibly be some underlying psychosis or mood instability? \n\n4.) This is a personal choice, but I don\u2019t tell my family members when a patient threatens me. The only thing it would do is make them upset about something that will 99.9% of the time not actually happen (I don\u2019t know actual statistics, all I know is that in my 11 years of experience, 100% of verbal threats directed at me have never come to fruition post-discharge).  \n\n5.) If this is super distressing to you, you may need to reconsider if this field is the one for you.\n\n(Edit: formatting)",

If you can find one who shoots competitively they're excellent to learn from.  Dry fire drills are just as important as range time.  Figure out your most comfortable carry and practice drawing from said carry.  Hit a range regularly to practice, and expect to go through thousands of rounds.  You should approach it like one would martial arts.\n\nI've also trained in handling knives for self defense and in BJJ since carrying a firearm or even a knife isn't always practical, especially in our field.  That walk from the hospital to your car after a long day?  Easiest location for a patient to find you if they want to.  I know several psychiatrists who have been accosted by disgruntled patients that way.\n\nPlenty of folks have commented detailed and solid advice already about steps you can take to be notified of release, scrubbing info, etc.  Definitely worth taking now and saving to reference later.",

That means you\u2019re more likely to have it on you if you do have a violent confrontation.\n\nIf you do choose to buy a gun, go beyond a simple concealed weapons class and be sure to get instruction in shooting in stressful scenarios.

        "comment": ">If you register to vote, your address is findable on the internet. There's no way around that.\n\nThis, it turns out, depends on your state.\n\nI recently moved and am using the opportunity to try to scrub my home location from the internet, and indeed from every digital record I can, and it's been fascinating what I have found out.\n\nHere in Massachusetts, you need to register to vote at your residence, but you can have a separate mailing address that's a PO Box.  This is what I've done, and so far, it's worked as intended: my voter registration info, voter guide, ballot, etc all went to the PO Box.  I have received no political maiings at my home address.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the worst things you can do re your privacy is buy a home under your own name.  We used a trust to buy our place, and it's been *flabbergasting* how much junk mail we get sent to our home address, with the recipient name being the name of our trust.  We use that trust for absolutely nothing else; the only public record of it is on our deed as the owner of our home.   But within literal days of the deed been registered, junk mail started showing up for \"\\[REDACTED\\] Realty Trust\".  There are evidently business entities out there that have real-time monitoriting of Registrar of Deeds websites, hoovering up every new listing, and then turning around and selling the results to advertisers.  And presumably to people-finder services.\n\nA trust, however, cannot get a mortgage, so our mortgage is in our own names.  This gets logged into a national system.  Interestingly, this hasn't leaked so far.  Our mortgage, which is less than a year old, has already been sold twice.  We had to kick each of the new lenders to update their records to use our PO box as the address of correspondence instead of the address of the mortgaged property, but that's not been a problem.\n\nThe federal Know Your Customer (KYC) laws apparently mandated that financial services like banks establish your residential address when you open an account, but then you're free to change it and they don't care.  I had no problem changing my current bank accounts and credit cards to use my PO box as my address of record.\n\nConsequently, despite showing my mortgage and knowing about all my credit cards, *none of the three credit reporting bureaus know my current residential address.*\n\nThe worst problem I've had is \u2013 wait for it \u2013 medical systems.  My PCP's office insisted that they can't possibly accept a PO box as my address despite the fact the larger healthcare system they're a part of having already done so.  My specialists' practices have been better.  I am no longer insured through the MA HealthConnector, but they require a residential address on record, still, I think because what plans are available to an insured are by county or municipality of residence, but they do allow mailing addresses.",

Most of the time I brushed it off as antisocials saying antisocial things when they didn't get their way, or when someone was heavily intoxicated with substances. My residency was in a medium size city, one in which you did run a high risk of seeing patients outside of the popular bars, grocery stores, etc. My attending at the time advised I purchase a firearm for the future, \"just in case\". She owned one herself because she did actually have a patient escape, who began tracking prior providers but was thankfully apprehended before they could find anyone- she was #3 on his list. Other psychiatrists from my program advised getting firearms as well due to their own prior experiences. In the state I was training, physicians often did restrict patient rights; it was in their laws, as opposed to other states where the duty is often left to the police or a judge. The role provided to the psychiatrist in that situation created the dynamic where the psychiatrist was the individual violating the patient's perceive rights and the target of their anger. \n\n  \nI don't have recommendations for a security system, but if you are interested in firearm recommendations (type, basics, lessons, safety, etc), I do have plenty of those.",

        "comment": "I've liked alarm dot com, and while their cameras aren't as great quality as the Google ones, if you give permission beforehand the monitoring service can access them when the alarm is tripped.  That has been useful when our system was accidentally tripped by a member of my family as they were able to give me a description, I recognized the individual, and could confirm it was a false alarm.  You can set it up for a brief delay when the alarm is tripped to allow you to dismiss it on the app if you recognize it is a false alarm before it goes to their monitoring service.  Their service has been solid and easy to use.  I like the variety of sensors they offer that all integrate into the system - glass break, motion, window/door, smoke/CO detectors, etc.  I also like that it's separate from my smart home system and general WiFi, it's WiFi connection is encrypted, and everything will work if the power is out since the monitoring base has a battery backup and cellular service.  You can install everything yourself, or pay someone for installation.  Their cameras also have an option to back up video footage locally.  \n\nSeveral years ago I went with a simple hardwired Google camera for an out of state property that was vacant.  That worked very well and both the day and night images were excellent.  Had a great view of my front door all the way to the end of my driveway, and it was effective in screening out false alerts of animals in the yard, or cars driving by.  I self-monitored via alerts to my phone and had the local PD on speed-dial who responded quickly when I had to call them.  That being said, I much prefer professional monitoring.\n\nI've also tried the Arlo cameras in a rental.  They worked okay, but weren't hardwired.  They ran on battery and used solar panels to charge during the day.  During the winter they didn't get enough daytime charge to run all night, so they weren't that reliable, and the image quality and notification accuracy wasn't as good as the google cameras.",

I didn't pursue a restraining order as I don't think it would be enforced and it would just feed into the delusion. And I did seek advice from the security office at my current institution which was really helpful. The director happened to have a psychology background and his take was that this will likely be chronic. I worked on improving the safety measures in my home(the security office did a home visit) and was advised to cultivate situational awareness. I don't feel too bad about that as I think that's a good skill to have regardless. Regarding stress, honestly sadly, I've learned of other psychiatrists who have had this issue and that has helped. So in that way, I feel less alone.",

They don't cure delirium, and only treating the underlying cause will reduce the duration. It's good to have confirmation, but it's not much of a game-changer.\n\nWhere antipsychotics do, and perhaps should, get used, is in hyperactive delirium where agitation impedes care and endangers the patient.\n\n>...our findings allow for the possibility that some patients (e.g., nonintubated patients with hyperactive delirium describing delusions and hallucinations... may benefit from antipsychotic treatment.\n\nWhich accords more with both what I was taught and how I have usually seen antipsychotics used in the ICU.",

It is by no means perfect but this is not a training site quality issue.\n\nI am not sure why you are threatened by the idea that what you have learned to do is not necessarily the only and objectively correct standard of care.

Is somnolence not a well documented effect already though? Is there really even the slightest doubt they do put people to sleep reliably? \n\nI'm sorry, I understand why you would want high quality data, it just seems to me that the idea that antipsychotics make people fall asleep, well, it's about as evident as the sky being blue or the sun being bright. \n\nOh well though.

If you're an insomniac, like moi, you can either go to bed without a sleep aid, mostly likely wasting an hour or two at least attempting to fall asleep before you do, wake up feeling tired of course because you slept 6 hours instead of 8, or you can take a sleep aid before going to bed, but then you will most likely want to sleep 10-11 hours minimum because indeed, the sleep is lower quality, and the hypnotic effect never seems to wear off before it should. So either way, you're getting inefficient sleep and losing precious time out of your day that would be better put towards accomplishing something. \n\nIt would be good know at the least, which of all the hypnotics is least disruptive on your \"sleep architecture.\" I'll have to see if I can find anything on that. \n\nMy main contention is not so much APs are great for sleep though, so much as your GABAergic sedatives are potentially even worse. Sedative withdrawal is often described as worse than opioid withdrawal, that says something truly. In fact, I have a fair amount of persisting PTSD-like symptoms as a result of sedative withdrawal; you know, flashbacks and panic attacks and nightmares. Does my experience make me biased? Or does it make me informed? Both? \n\nI just worry that sedative withdrawal is not taken seriously, is all. Maybe because your psychiatric patients are always weaned down ever so carefully, one forgets what the situation looks like without such a taper. \n\nYour textbook descriptions of withdrawal never seem to do it justice. For some reason, they frequently omit the defining symptom, which is of course, extreme dysphoria. AP withdrawal on the other hand is frequently *euphoric.* Which would you choose if you had to pick one? ",

        "text": "Sorry for my frustration. It's been 2 very bad years for me with no antidepressants doing anything. They don't even feel like a cup of coffe. Even a nicotine buzz is stronger. \n\nThey simply don't work.\n\nAnyone similar to me that tried everything and nothing worked and tried nardil too?\n\nI found it it's a trycyclic monoamine reuptake inhibitor and people really swear by it that they feel it and actually it changed their lives.\n\nI wonder if that's true. Also i forgot to add pregabalin INSTANTLY makes me motivated get out of bed produce music draw i can be a bit hyperactive on it but that's just my adhd anyways lifts my depression and anxiety 10/10 + i get nerve pain relief which is great cause i have very severe chronic pain toen ligaments bones cracked musles teared up i need surgery...\n\nAnyways 300mg-450mg max is a great dose to actually get some real work done, and finish the day not being so depressed i didn't do anything. My psychiatrist took me off cause my parents thought i was acting bad on it but i was just honestly drinking alot and was angry at them anyways so it didn't matter,will ask my psychiatrist for pregabalin again. Out of 20-30 different kinds of pills the only good ones that ACTUALLY help me are pregabalin (i also stop drinking alcohol on it, it completely replaces it) benzos even tho i can't even feel em anymore i want some research chemical flunitrazolam or clonitrazolam...but clonazepam and possibly will try alprazolam for panic attacks are fine...all benzos are fine.\n\nZolpidem was pure magic when i first started it. Now again it barely does anything but if i get panicky it can replace benzos since it also hits gaba receptors and acts in a similar way.\n\nSo - antipsychotics are pure poison that make you dumb and you sleep and you're brain dead.\n\nSome guys at psychiatry overdosed me on haloperidol to the point my whole body and every muscle was hard as a stone i thought i would break all my bones but akineton saved me... That is called neuroleptic malignant syndrome it has around 50% survival rate.\n\nI hate all antipsychotics I can't even use them for sleep even when i really need to because they legit male me dumber i swear. Slower thinking cant form complex thoughts forgetful etc ... Proved to decrese gray matter and shrink the brain\n\nOlanzapine isn't that bad, it's ok in low doses...\n\nI still avoid it. \n\nI have almost a life threatening emergency when i tried seroquel even only 25mg. \n\nI was starting to lose consciousness and i was starting to die i swear i was screaming in the car for my mom cause I didn't want to die....was so close will never take it again it messes my heart up.\n\nSo after a huge random manic post by an excentric quasi-spiritual scientific maniac with multiple personalities I don't even know what the point of the post was.\n\nOh, i will try nardil when my mania ends.\n\nSorry guys for a confusing post.\n\n\n\nClonitrazolam has the best feeling in the world. Opiates don't even come close. Not even nitazenes that are more euphoric than heroin. When you knock yourself out on clonaz it's so...nostalgic...\n\nSorry for spamming i have 3 personality disorders and right now i am very manic.\n\nNo sleep for 4 days 4 nights i have zero idea how I'm still going. How is my body still operating why am i not tired?\n\nAfter the manic episode usually i get weeks and weeks of depression again so not looking forward to it.\n\nAnyways,",

I need a pipe now, a little bottle full off crystal dmt and another one of pure harmine.

        "comment": "I came across a news report on methylfolate as an addon treatment in depression, and tried it out in 2019, and it instantly made me feel better - more energy. Unfortunately, I developed a nasty allergy to it (cracks on the backs of my hands, oozing blood; red dry skin). A month ago I started from a tiny dose, 100 mcg/day and increased it gradually to 400 mcg/day, all the while using hydrocortisone on my arms and feet to prevent the allergic reaction. It seems to work thus far.\n\nI feel better.I take it as an addon to my venlafaxine 225 mg/day; previously I used escitalopram 10 mg/day as my main antidepressant.\n\nAccording to a [2022 study by Lisa Pan et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/metabolomic-disorders-confirmed-presence-of-potentially-treatable-abnormalities-in-patients-with-treatment-refractory-depression-and-suicidal-behavior/8F0468647ED167CB4D08AC5F903B9C43), some 5% of patients with treatment-resistant depression (in her sample) had [cerebral folate deficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_folate_deficiency), and she used [folinic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folinic_acid) to increase their 5-MTHF levels in cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nI don't think L-methylfolate is a universal drug for all kinds of depression - probably just for some patients. I wish there was more high-quality research into this. Thus far, studies have been low-scale, although a meta-analysis ([Maruf et al., 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34794190/)) indicates it does have an effect. But a meta-analysis goes only as far as the studies included in it.",

Thus far, generic sapropterin has only started appearing on pharmacy shelves in the West, so it may take a long time until it arrives here.  \n\n\nI don't know my MTHFR gene status.

I thought all I received was fluids, anti nausea meds, and those huge magnesium / calcium tabs.

My only question now is what that medicine could have been used for :)\n\nMy official diagnosis on the chart was dehydration.

Non smoker, non drinker and dont do recreational drugs.\n\nMedication: Effexor XR 150mg, haloperidol 3mg, minoxidil 5mg, vitamin D and B.\n\nConditions: Tourettes syndrome, OCD, general anxiety disorder, depression, neuralgia\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Ive been taking haloperidol for my tourettes syndrome since I was less than 10 years old and I think the haloperidol may be affecting my motivation to work and do things like cleaning etc.  \n\n I stopped taking it for 1.5 weeks  just 2 months ago and I found my motivation increased a lot but my tics got much worse. Ive also had to go to the toilet to urinate often throughout the day and night (10-15 times a day) for as long as  I can remember.\n\n So what Im asking is does haloperidol affect peoples motivation as a side effect and does also affect your urge to go to the toilet often.\n\n If it does are there any alternative medications I can ask my neurologist about other than haloperidol.  Ive already tried clonidine and guanfacine but unfortunately the side effects on those were worse than haloperidol. Thanks",

I\u2019ve been struggling with this for a year and some months now and I don\u2019t understand why I am dealing with this. I\u2019m not sure if had an allergic reaction to those drugs or what but it\u2019s the truth I cannot sleep. I don\u2019t know what to do. How do you treat someone with my case of insomnia? ",

I was suffering from health anxiety and ibs so I was taking these meds as per my psychiatrist's advice. I came to know that anti-psychotics like haloperidol can cause mild immunosuppression and that can reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897763/#:~:text=Antipsychotic%20treatment%20altered%20immune%20function,cytokines%20(IFN%2D%CE%B3) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920996499001164) are the links to the studies. Should I be worried?\n\nUpdate - I had stopped these meds 8-10 days before I got the vaccines so I guess I should be safe. Getting a titer test will definitely cure my anxiety but the whole procedure including the formalities is difficult and will atleast take two weeks. Please suggest something in the meantime. \n\nWill the drug have a significant immunosuppression effect?",

I finally get a referral for an EMG, still waiting!\n\nI have also had occasional back neck and right shoulder blade pain, and noticed if I put pressure on shoulder my hand instantly goes numb, I have had a brain MRI, ECG, chest x-ray, full bloods, all good.\n\nSo my question is should I push for a cervical MRI? Could this be related to a bulging or herniated disc? Is it common to have both arms affected? Or what it could possibly be.\n\n# Any help greatly appreciated \ud83d\udc4d",

On 3 separate occasions they got so out of control that we felt we had to call the cops.\n\nWe've tried a number of mood stabilizers. More recently he was on buspirone. But he was still quickly agitated and impatient and not quite as angry as before but there was still anger just under the surface.\n\nSo now we're trying Seroquel. It's been recommended on the Alzheimer's subreddit. At first the doctor suggested we cut a pill in half and give it to him every night for a week to see how it goes. But it didn't seem to make a difference. Then I tried a half pill every morning and every night. And now for about 4 days I've been giving him the full dosage that's on the bottle, one pill every morning and another every night.\n\nHe seems more like his old self. I think? It's hard to tell. But his old self was a piece of shit. He's angrier than he was on buspirone. My mom's scared and uncomfortable around him again.\n\nDoes Seroquel just take a while to get into a person's system? Does any time to adjust to the medication? Or is this just the wrong one for us? One of the things he gets angry about is imaginary arguments that never actually happened. Like this morning my mom said that he thinks I yelled at him when we haven't even spoken yet. I thought Seroquel was an antipsychotic? I thought it was supposed to help when people were seeing things?\n\nHe's 66. About 210 lb. 5'10 maybe.",

Ive suffered with hemmerrhoids 10 years prior to this. I should mention that I did have a hemmroidectomy 1 week after the iron injection. \n\nIf possible I'd like some advice/ insight as to what the problem may be. Should an IM iron injection be painful this long after it was administered?\nCould it be related to something else entirely?\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated \ud83d\ude4f\nThank you.",

        "text": "This occured a few years ago shortly after I turned 19 (male). Weight at the time was probably around 110 lbs and around 5\"7 or 5\"8. Now, same as back then, no known physical medical conditions but diagnosed mental ones including OCD, clinical depression, GAD, and now BPD. \n\nI'd prefer not to go so far as to list my specific medications at the time unless asked but I can say they were common antidepressant medications with few contraindications. \n\n***\n\nSo now for the actual event - I was suicidal at the time and self-medicated by getting excessively drunk and asked to be taken to hospital. This occured in a city in Ontario, Canada. \n\nWhile at the ER, I became belligerent, panicked, and as the situation escalated (I think I was pissed that they wouldn't let me just leave) I was restrained by security and experienced delusions that they were going to sexually assault me. Obviously it's all fuzzy but I remember crying \"please don't rape me\" and a needle being stuck in my ass that just knocked me out. \n\nWhen I woke up I had no more delusions or anything but for the next few days I still had lingering effects of severe fatigue in a way I've never felt before. \n\nI've always wondered what drug actually would have been used to knock me out and settle me down? And which one is typically used in these situations in ERs? Some basic Googling makes me suspect Droperidol but I'm curious. Thanks.",

        "title": "Stomach cancer?",
        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nMy best friend (64) might be diagnosed with stomach cancer soon. I'm so filled with anxiety that I wanted to get advice from someone.\n\nThe story line: My friend went to Baja California Mexico in December. Did not get sick but a month and half later after Mexico he started getting intense stomach pains.\n\nDescribed as a 3-4 on 10 pain scale. He vomited maybe once or twice at some point, but never again. He does not have acid reflux, just stomach stabs. Went to the doctor to look for parasites, but saw nothing. I believe he did a blood test (for cancer?)  but at this point his mind is too fuzzy to remember. If it did happen, nothing was to be seen.\n\nDoctor gave him some medication for his stomach and he adapted his diet to bland simple foods, yogurts, anything with healthy bio-culture etc. He would burp a lot and farting was common, both relieved the pressure and pain. Pepto Bismol also did the trick to relieve pain. The pain got less thanks to less food intake and the pep, but in the last month his upper abdomen (especially upper) started bloating. You could see a big vein pop out through the skin. Everything became very tender and tight. We thought it was gas. He was afraid he was getting constipated because he had not defecated like he normally would. Eventually he did pass a small handful of hard goat nuggets but did nothing the ease the pain. I personally believe the small stools are caused by not eating/drinking enough.\n\nThe pain and bloating got  to a severe point he needed to do a gastroscopy. By looking at the belly, the doctor first thought it might be gas buildup, but the next day they saw that there was no gas. The bloating is caused by fluid buildup, which could be a tell-tale sign of stage 4 stomach cancer that is now infecting the abdomen. The doctor did not give positive news and this was his prediction. They took stomach tissue for to see if there is cancer so we will soon find out, but in the meantime everyone is freaking out...\n\nIt's weird to me that he would have cancer in his stomach, let alone stage 4. No vomiting, blood in stool etc. He's a healthy guy and every year goes for a echo scan over his body. Nothing to be seen...Is stage 4 stomach cancer invisible or that small that an ecoscan could not pick it up? Not so long ago, before all this, he had a clean endoscopy (don't know if you can tell stomach cancer from this). No history of cancer in the family. Ascita (the fluid in the abdomen) is mostly caused by something going on with your liver, like cirrhosis. Could the fluid be caused by malnutrition (he's lost a lot of weight and only eats/drinks a handful a day)? Could it be H.pylori from Mexico? It would explain all the symptoms except the fluid buildup, unless the bacteria has gotten outside into the abdomen? Or effected the liver (Portal hypertension). Maybe it has nothing to do with the stomach, but with the liver?\n\nAnyway...I am just really interested in hearing what you guys think and if anybody has experienced the same thing? I'm expecting the worst but a slow growing cancer like that in the stomach just seems baffling to me, but everything is possible.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nAndi\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nUpdate NSFW!\n\nIf you have people suffering the same type of cancer and don't want to read a depressing turn of events do not read.\n\n\\-------------\n\nMy friend went into the hospital for the CAT SCAN. They saw there was, along with fluid, air in his abdomen so possibly a perforation. They drained 3 liters of fluid and opened him up only to find that the stomach cancer was all spread over his intestines (even though he had done an endoscopy last year). It was terminal and they said he only had 4 to 8 weeks to live...Chemo was not worth trying. They gave him a colostomy bag to relieve pressure from his belly and had him recover in the hospital for a week.\n\nThey put him on morphine and he started getting sick everyday, small vomits or brown/green bile. He though he was dying the first day so I rushed to the hospital to say goodbye. He wasn't dying. We coordinated with the hospital from Germany to bring him home to his house/garden in the Netherlands. Once home we started palliative sedation, per his request, (euthanasia would have taken 2 weeks to organize, and he hated pain/being uncomfortable and wanted to hasten things along) and within two day he breathed his last breath. It was so sad and so fucking gnarly...\n\nI have found peace with his passing but I am kinda upset on how he passed away. It went fast, thank god, but the palliative sedation did not work as planned. Maybe somebody can answer some questions?\n\n1. He was constantly vomiting out brown bile. Eventually they put a tube in his stomach which helped but he said it \"fucking hurt\". What was it? Was the brownness bacterium from the operation when they cut him up? Was it the opiates that were making him feel sick?\n2. For the palliative sedation they gave him Morphine for the pain and Midazolam which was supposed to put him to sleep but instead he was restless, moaning, moving his arms around, scratching at his bandages and occasionally grimacing. At one point he opened his eyes when I tried to sooth him with words. At night he even tried to get up and started tearing at his tubing and ripped off his colostomy bag. We had to restrain him with 2 people (gently, because we didn't want to spook him). He was wearing an adult diaper (we wanted him to fall asleep before giving him a catheter) but he pushed them down and started peeing. I guess he was being very uncomfortable and he needed to pee and didn't understand that he could just let go? The nurses said he was fighting the sedative because he wasn't mentally ready to die/ still pretty strong/young? It was very rare for people to be able the fight the sedation. It was a horrible experience because we wanted him to fall into a deep sleep and not be in pain. He must have been exhausted because he got not nights rest and he was extremely dehydrated. So my question to you guys is: was he in pain? Was he lost in some nightmare? Need an honest answer, please.\n\nFinally in the morning they upped the Midazolam and gave him Haloperidol to counter the delirium and he finally went limp. For a couple hours he laid there breathing out brown foam/bile during the death gurgle. It was absolutely heartbreaking...but a relief that his mind was finally gone and all that was left was his heart and lungs desperately trying to survive that last stretch. His breathing finally slowed down and he died.\n\nI'm glad I was there to help him on his way and do everything in my control to relieve the pain as much as possible. I just wish it had gone better than it had.",

        "title": "Am I a Hypochondriac or do I actually have a rare disorder?",
        "text": "I, (21F) have had chronic pain, on and off, in my left flank for 5 years. It had never migrated anywhere, and for the first 4 years I would have flare ups where the pain would be constant for up to two months, until something was done to relieve it. It would then be gone for a while, but it always comes back. At 16, I was diagnosed with severe Hydronephrosis in my left kidney. I have had multiple procedures for it, but where i was relatively young when they started I can\u2019t remember the names, so the best I can do is to describe them. The first one was a surgery where they cut a piece of my ureter out, and then sewed it back together, all done laparoscopically. From there, i\u2019ve had multiple stents put in my ureter, I\u2019ve had 2 more surgeries where they reopened the ureter using a laser, and I even had a nephrostomy tube for 3 months (they took it out because it kept getting infected, and wasn\u2019t helping enough to justify all of the antibiotics and the amount of times they had to change the tube out). Along with this pain, I also have chronic nausea and vomiting (I frequently take Gravol 50mg, Zofran 8mg, Metonia/Maxeran/metocloprimide 10mg, and Haloperidol 1mg for this), and whenever I get my urine tested there is ALWAYS at least trace amounts of blood in my urine, and it has nothing to do with my menstrual cycle, as many times the urine came directly from my nephrostomy tube. I am also prone to kidney infections, and have received treatment for one about 30 times in the past five years, a handful of them severe enough to be hospitalized. I\u2019ve been to the ER probably around 400 times in the past five years to this pain that gets unbearable and completely debilitating at times, and most of the time the doctors don\u2019t know what to do with me. Some think i\u2019m seeking pain meds, some think it\u2019s anxiety (which my family doctor had tested me for, and I do not have), some think I\u2019m simply a hypochondriac. However, this past year (starting right before I got the nephrostomy tube), the pain has gotten worse and is constant. During my adolescent years, I saw a very well respected paediatric urologist, who had explained to me that he believes there is something wrong, but it\u2019s something more than just the Hydronephrosis. I was then sent to an adult urologist, and I\u2019ve had a terrible experience with him. He\u2019s very arrogant, extremely dismissive, and talks down to me and my mother, but is a completely different person when my father is around, so it leads me to believe that the reason i\u2019ve had a negative experience is because I am a young female, although I am not certain. This urologist agrees that my Hydronephrosis is not causing this severe of symptoms, but he believes it is all in my head and there is absolutely nothing wrong with my kidney, as it functions at a normal level, aside from the severe swelling. Because he was adamant that this is not the kidney, he sent me to numerous specialists to check out basically every other organ in my body. I\u2019m been to gastroenterologists, gynaecologists, rheumatologists, and neurologists, I\u2019ve had Bloodwork, Ultrasounds, CT Scans, and MRI\u2019s to check out almost all of my organs, including my Gallbladder, Pancreas, Liver, Uterus, Appendix, and even my brain, and nothing had come up, snd they\u2019ve all sent me back to this urologist. About 7 months ago, an RN recommended that I check out a disorder called Loin Pain Hematuria Syndrome (LPHS), as she heard of a story in her school of someone with the exact same symptoms, who had been through exactly what i\u2019ve gone through with doctors, and her urologist came to the conclusion she had LPHS. I have since researched it (I did use google, but I made sure to only read information from organizations for rare disorders/illnesses and research papers cited with sources, and while some of the sources were unavailable to me, I read up on as many of them as I could), and talked to about 10 other individuals with this disorder, and everything that I am going through is the exact same symptoms they deal with. I then brought it up to my family doctor and my urologist, as it is a diagnosis of exclusion. My family doctor agreed that it was the most likely cause, but when I talked to my urologist about it, he told me that he does not believe I have LPHS, his exact (and only) reasoning was that \u201calthough it would explain all of my symptoms, it is a very rare condition, therefore it is unlikely that I have it.\u201d I then asked for a second opinion from another urologist. When I talked to the second urologist, he agreed that it was likely this is the cause, but where the only treatments are a Nephrectomy or an Autotransplantation, he wants me to see a pain specialist before he commits to this diagnosis. I saw the pain specialist, and he was absolutely convinced this is the cause, and that the only solution was one of the surgeries, and in the meantime, he has put me on a high dose of opioids (Hydromorphe Contin 9mg 3x daily) to help with my pain. While this does help a lot, i am still in pain every day, and hardly sleep at night between waking up in pain and waking up vomiting, and I have bad days where i do still end up in the hospital. My original urologist then decided that he was going to take back over my case, and has been very reluctant to operate as he still believes its all in my head, but he has put me on the waitlist for this surgery. However, after all of the ER doctors and my surgeon telling me it\u2019s probably just in my head, my whole family has also come to question that this is a real disorder I have.  I\u2019ve looked up hypochondriacs, and I don\u2019t exhibit any of the typical behaviours of one, except for the frequent trips to the doctor, and not believing them when they say it\u2019s all in my head. My problem here, is that literally everyone around me is telling me that while this *might* be real, it is most likely not, and I am just a hypochondriac, and I don\u2019t know what to believe anymore. Is it possible that I\u2019ve just concocted all of these symptoms in my head?\n\n*Other information*\nI am Caucasian, 5\u20192, weigh approximately 165lbs (I recognize that according to my BMI I am overweight, but I carry most of my weight in my bust and hips), have never used any drugs that were not prescribed to me, I have never used any form of Marijuana, I casually drink (1-3 drinks) about 2-3 times a year, and I do not smoke cigarettes, but I do vape nicotine, as I find it helps my nausea. I have been diagnosed with depression, and periodically mild gastritis and Esophagitis from all of the puking, but have been assured by multiple gastroenterologists that this is in now way the cause of any of my pain.",

I just feel hopeless, I can't concentrate, and I lose all interest in things. I also sleep a lot, partly because I feel exhausted and partly because sleep is a coping mechanism. Then sometimes I cry because I ruminate on negative things and feel like the world would be better off without me. However, when the weather improves during the week, my mood improves with it as well. I stop getting the negative thought patterns and stop feeling awful. My sleep also reduces from 12+ hours to my normal 10 hours. (My bipolar medications sedate me.)\n\nI don't know what to do about this. I've tried going out for walks or just driving somewhere, but the cold temps and dark skies seem to counteract the positives of getting fresh air and exercise. I  also make sure to keep the lights on in my apartment, but that isn't helping. The only thing that seems to help is an improvement in weather (more sun, maybe a 5F or 10F increase in temperature, etc.).\n\nI don't think this is a bipolar thing, because it's not a constant, soul-crushing depression that lasts  for months on in. It's a thing that only happens in the winter and on select days. And the mood improvement with good weather is not hypomania or mania because (A.) it doesn't last as long as my normal hypomanias and manias do, and (B.) I don't feel *excessively* good.",

I do regular liver enzyme checks due to taking so many medications. \n\nHere is the issue, as far as i can remember, even when I was young, I would not benefit from medication at the usual doses, and would need much higher doses for them to work, in some cases, even the maximum dosage would not be enough. For example, on average people take 2 500mg Paracetamol pills for a minor headache, but i would not benefit without taking at least 4. This trend has continued with everything, Quetiapine was initially one 25 mg pill at night for insomnia, but no benefit without taking 3-4. Xanax was prescribed at the local maximum dose of 1 mg for panic attacks and severe cases of insomnia, and i would not benefit unless i took at least 3. For Methylphenidate I am on the local maximum dose of 60 mg once a day, the pill is half IR and then a second IR release 4 hours later intended to last a total 4 hours, the dosage feels nowhere near enough, even after a tolerance break, and the pill wears off after 2 hours instead of 8, so on so forth for every single medication. When it comes to alcohol, i can drink a full bottle of vodka with ease and not get fully drunk.\n\nI\u2019ve seen multiple doctors and none could explain it, only an endocrinologist had a theory, but could not prove it, he claimed that I likely have an extremely fast metabolism, this is highly likely as unless i consume 6 large meals a day i will not feel full, and i get hungry within two hours of a large meal. But could metabolism really affect medication tolerance? If not, what could be a possible reason for my situation that i could go check for?",

At the beginning of the pain I had mucus in my urine for a few days and blood in it for one day. Since then I havent had any more mucus or blood in my urine but the pain is still there. The rib around my left kidney seems like its popping sometimes when I move too. It feels like a dull ache and is worse when I put pressure on the rib on my back. One thing I think may have caused it is 7 days ago I was sitting in my computer chair in an awkward position watching a video and I was kind of tensing my mid torso while in that position (I have tourettes syndrome). I plan on going to the doctor this week if it doesn't improve soon. Does anyone know what could be causing this?",

        "text": "So since the middle of July, I've been constantly nauseated and have been burping frequently. I went to sleep healthy that night, only to wake up in the middle of the night feeling like I was going to throw up multiple times. But I just burped which slightly relieved the nausea. In the morning, when I ate breakfast, it hurt like 2 seconds after I swallowed food in my stomach. I went to work and had to go home after almost throwing up during lunch. I felt nauseated and dizzy. And ever since that night, I've been nauseated (4 months now). Gastroscopy didn't find anything, my blood, urine and stool samples were okay. And now I'm going to see a specialist since my doctor doesn't seem to know what the problem is.\n\nThe nausea is not as severe as it was when it began, but it is still very much there. And I don't feel dizzy anymore like I did when it all started. But I still feel nauseated and burp a lot.\n\nWeightlifting, my favourite hobby, seems to make it worse. I've tried Meclizine, PPI, Mirtazapine and Haloperidol, and nothing has relieved this nausea. Sometimes the nausea doesn't bother me at all, but sometimes it gets so bad that I can't do anything at all.\n\nThis nausea affects my life so much that it has made me depressed and forced me to put my studies on halt. Has anyone experienced anything like this?",

        "title": "Is there anything that causes excessive urination and thirst other than Diabetes Insipidus",
        "text": "I (23, M, White) have been suffering from excessive urination and thirst for maybe about 3 years (maybe 4) now. To get an idea of how bad it is, I recently took a 24 hour urine test, and completely filled up 3 jugs and some of a 4th. It's so bad that it prevents me from getting to sleep (especially combined with the thirst), which has caused me to only be able to go to bed when I'm excessively tired (I'm talking 4 or 5 in the morning) in order to not be constantly waking up to pee and drink, and thus destroyed what semblance of a sleep schedule I may have had. I sometimes have a full stream every 5-10 minutes, though 20 minutes is more common. It's worse at night, but still bad during the day, and negatively impacts my quality of life. The urination still happens if I dehydrate myself (albeit less of a full stream), so I don't think it's because of how much I drink.\n\nI've been seeing an endocrinologist and she seems to think that Diabetes Insipidus is the only endocrine explanation for those symptoms. But she's been testing my blood for over a year, and my hormones are completely normal, so she thinks it's likely not Diabetes Insipidus. I'm still getting an MRI of my pituitary just in case, but so far it seems like that's not the cause, and that makes me nervous. I do have an appointment with a Urologist, but my own research hasn't found anything that makes sense in terms of Urology. Everything I've found online that might cause excessive urination doesn't fit my symptoms, and even worse, doesn't account for the thirst at all. I'm scared that we're not going to figure out the cause of this, and that will destroy my ability to function.\n\nTo give as much background as I can, I'm about 5' 8'', and I currently weight around 205 pounds, but that's after losing a lot of weight. 5 months ago, I weighed closer to 250 and had terrible eating habits. I don't have diabetes, but I do have insulin resistance (as discovered by the aforementioned endocrinologist) and am currently taking Metformin for it. I was also recently prescribed Haloperidol and Lamotrigine for mental health reasons, but that's just from the last few months. I have no allergies, have never had surgery, and am generally pretty healthy outside of being overweight and out of shape. When I was in middle school, I had to go on growth hormone and some other shot (I don't remember what it's called) because my growth plates were closing too quickly. Not sure if that's connected to this, but I figure it's at least worth mentioning. That's about everything I can think of. So, with that, is there any possible explanation for my excessive urination and thirst that isn't Diabetes Insipidus? I really want to know that there is something out there that explains my symptoms, and that there's hope that I won't have to suffer this for the rest of my life.",

They're just monitoring the behavior for now.\n\nI've looked into things like Borderline Personality Disorder, Schizoid Personality Disorder, Delusional Disorder, etc. since they involve hallucinations, and the disorder I identify the most with appears to be schizophrenia, [based on the schizophrenia DSM 5 criteria](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/index.shtml).\n\nI think I have catatonic excitement, as I tend to pace around a lot and get bursts of hyperactivity where I just smile and laugh at nothing.\n\nI have an ADHD diagnosis where I have poor working memory, can't pay attention, and have poor executive functioning, but I think these \"ADHD symptoms\" could explain the cognitive schizophrenic symptoms instead.\n\nI also sometimes get these \"phases\" where I don't think the world is real. \"It's fake and I'm living in an alternate universe.\" So I walk around at work and think everything is fake and that I should just leave \"since it's not real anyway\". And sometimes I *have* left. I also sometimes think the world is fake when I'm going grocery shopping, so I leave the store and say, \"This is fake. I don't need food.\"\n\nI can't say how long I've had these symptoms for because I've been on an antipsychotic and the symptoms only started appearing about 2 years ago. (Conversations with two voices in my head who were insulting me.) But they quickly disappeared when I started an antipsychotic. Only a few times do these symptoms \"break through\" -- typically under high stress -- and that's when I start a new antipsychotic or boost the antipsychotic dose. So it's hard to say how \"frequent\" I experience these symptoms.\n\nAbout me: 25M, 5'8\",140lbs, Hispanic, Meds=haloperidol, lamotrigine, ritalin",

I have been diagnosed with tourettes syndrome, OCD, general anxiety disorder, major depression and neuralgia. I dont smoke, drink or use drugs. I am currently taking 3mg haloperidol, 2* 37.5mg capsules of effexor XR .and 5mg of minoxidil tablets for hair loss. \n\nSo for the last 8-10 years whenever I lie in bed trying to fall asleep I hear noises that arent there such as phones ringing, birds chirping and other noises that Ive heard during the day. My dad was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in recent years and Im worried that I might be getting it. I don't really have any other symptoms of schizophrenia that Ive looked up online only the hallucinations. Looking these hallucinations up I found something called hypnagogic hallucinations and that seems to be what I am experiencing. \n\nI want to know if this really what i am experiencing and if they are related to schizophrenia or are they harmless / common.

It must be said I'm intelligent, but since the age of 19 I have been experiencing coprolalia not resolvable even by haloperidol, and more recently suffering cognitive deficits including \"the dropping of intelligence to zero\", which is understandably difficult to experience.\n\nNobody's taken the bold step of diagnosing me with schizophrenia, which leaves me with a heap of middle-finger half-diagnoses like \"Psychotic Disorder\" or \"Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified\". Coprolalia has gotten me \"Tourette Syndrome\" but I don't even match the usual progression for that. I've guessed it's the nature of psychiatry that difficult patients will get written off rather than sent through a process of intrigue, and when doctors become so quick to demonstrate their disinterest, the process of seeing a new doctor every time becomes a monetarily damaging event.\n\nI don't have the delusions/hallucinations required for schizophrenia - I don't feel I have anything to gain from antipsychotics - and I note that schizophrenia is linked to NMDA hypofunction, when NMDA supplementation (serine) doesn't resolve my situation. I've recently discovered that theanine (AMPA antagonist) betters my cognition in a very precise way that leads me to believe it holds the key: I'm currently appealing for a **perampanel** prescription, which in its selective AMPA antagonism, could prove my disease is AMPA hypofunction rather than NMDA hypofunction. (I'll know if it works: like theanine, it would allow me to pass through the daily \"void\" sooner.)\n\nNow, here's the kicker: I've spoken to a number of people who can't drink soda like me (experience involuntary mouth movement upon the sensation). It seems we're all immune to migraine headaches... and I've found four of us that have coprolalia.\n\nWhat's a guy to do?",

        "text": "20F, height: 5\u20199\u201d, weight: 140lb. Caucasian. I\u2019ve been dealing with some pretty bad depression and anxiety pretty much my whole life. I\u2019ve been on and off a lot of psych meds since I was 18. I got a diagnosis of cyclic vomiting this January after the symptoms started last March. Also there\u2019s a very considerable suspicion of a mild autism spectrum disorder. \n\nBasically, I\u2019ve had this issue of being pressured into antipsychotics, I\u2019m assuming (and hoping), more often than your average mental health patient. The first time it happened was during an involuntary commitment to a psych ward when I was 18 due to a really bad depressive episode. I can\u2019t remember what it was the psychiatrist wanted me to take anymore. I do remember asking him about side effects and he told me that he gives me medication for the main effect, so side effects don\u2019t matter. Me being terrified and trapped and barely old enough to be on the unit, I kept my mouth shut. It was taken off my med list at some point by a different doctor. The second time was after the cyclic vomiting started up, and nobody knew what it was. I was given haloperidol to help with my stomach. Immediately upon my first dose my anxiety spiked (before I even knew what it was) and I was suddenly terrified of everything from the situation to my parents leaving the room to the confines of the hospital bed. I got off the haldol after about a month and a half around the time I started having these horrible jaw movements. I would clench my mouth over and over, so hard that it hurt, and the only thing that stopped the movements was holding my tongue between my teeth so my own reflexes wouldn\u2019t let me bite down as hard. I couldn\u2019t sleep because of it. I hadn\u2019t been fully aware of how often tardive dyskinesia can happen with antipsychotics, especially the older ones. I knew what it was, and was already scared of getting it from other meds in the past, but it had not been mentioned to me regarding this one. I was hospitalized in a psych ward after that (for the sole reason that nobody knew why I was so sick and it was assumed it was entirely mental). I was in this hospital for a week and a half. The doctors kept trying to get me to sign a permission slip to put me on another antipsychotic. They told me it was for \u201canxiety and sleep.\u201d I kept refusing and asking for other options. I was given no other options. I tried to tell them about my tardive dyskinesia fears, and I was told that \u201ctardive dyskinesia is very rare, almost nobody gets it, it\u2019s one of those things that they just have to write on there, and even if it shows up it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d They said this to my face while my jaw and lips were twitching around. And finally, just last week, I was finally opening up to a totally new psychiatrist, I cried, I broke down hard telling her about all of the things that had happened over the past few years, how I felt like my voice wasn\u2019t being heard, how I felt like nothing I had to say really mattered. How I went almost an entire year with a real physical illness that was assumed to just be my anxiety, and as much as I insisted that it wasn\u2019t, nobody would listen. And she asks me to start an antipsychotic. For \u201csocial anxiety\u201d this time. I asked her to give me something else, try a depression or anxiety med, and she said she didn\u2019t think anything else would work for me. She eventually offered a depression med, which I took her up on, but then found out it would cost over $900 a month WITH insurance. There\u2019s a lot more to all this but I figured I\u2019ve complained enough. I just want to know why there\u2019s such an insistence on me taking antipsychotics. I do not hear voices or see things. I have not been diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. My current mental diagnoses are, as mentioned above, depression and anxiety, along with fairly high suspicion of autism. Why am I never offered reasonable alternatives when I turn these things down? Why have the side effects been downplayed or outright refused, even after I\u2019d experienced them? I\u2019m so scared to reach out for help for fear of being thrown in another facility and having to fight with doctors to not put me on another. I\u2019m also not the type of person to rely on essential oils and prayer. I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s some sort of note or even diagnosis on my record that I\u2019m not aware of or something. Is there any way I can find out why this keeps happening, and how I can stand up for myself in the future? Thanks in advance. \n\nAlso feel free to ask questions about the situation. It\u2019s a long and messy story and I didn\u2019t really want to go into full detail but I am willing to provide information as requested.",

Of course, as is apparently par for the course, I developed neurological issues... extreme headache, then they discharged me for second time, with no medication, tinnitus, floaters and visual snow developed.\n\nThere is nothing that has broken my migraine in the years since. It is there 100% of the time.\n\nFrom everything I read, neurological issues related to untreated HE and encephalopathy are generally permanent. But I've found very little cases about it online where the specifics of lasting symptoms are discussed; nothing specifically says \"permanent headache can occur.\" Just generally that permanent neurological issues can occur.\n\nAs some of you may know, the body loses it's ability to autoregulate hemodynamics when acute severe BP is untreated for too long... it results in overvasodilation in the brain, and generally widespread loss of hemodynamic control. So I have autonomic dysfunction ever since as well. Clonidine helps, verapamil helps, but that seems to definitely be permanent.\n\nAs far as advice on what to try next, my neurologists are pretty stumped.\n\nI went to Michigan Headache Institute, where they talked about deep cervical blocks, and not much else that I haven't tried. I've failed DHE, haloperidol, triptans, botox, marijuana, gabapentin, amitriptyline, lamictal, depakote, topamax, namenda etc.\n\nSo I guess my question to you, is, \"in all likelihood, given that my brain went through a severe trauma, untreated HE (my blood showed urine and +2 protein, had chest pain and headache), is the migraine most likely permanent or is there any hope? Or could there just be a permanent damage to the nerves, brain, blood-brain barrier, etc that will cause this to always go on (like CTE does to some)?\n\nI plan to try psychadelics, because that seems to be the last thing left, other then the small-molecule cgrp's (the large molecule ones didn't work).",

Should I stop taking the haloperidol?\n\nEdit: As long as I can remember, I've had these very brief *chills/spasms* through my body that suddenly occur and sometimes are noticeable enough to cause facial and/or arm muscles to move. I don't know if these are related, but I thought I'd just throw that in there, what I can only assume is some kind of mild seizure.",

        "text": "* Age: 92\n* Sex: Female\n* Height: 1,50m\t\n* Weight: 45Kgs\n* Race: European/Caucasian\n* Duration of complaint: Progressive dementia for the past 3-4 years.\n* Location (Geographic and on body): We are from Spain.\n* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): The Dementia itself, and she\u2019s prone to severe constipation, low bowel movement, leading sometimes to fecalomas.\n* Current medications (if any): Valsartan 160mg/day (although her blood pressure is fine) and osmotic laxatives like lactulose or macrogol.\n* Include a photo if relevant (skin condition for example): Not relevant.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\t\n\n\tSo this is the first time I\u2019m asking medical advice, but I\u2019d like to make a disclaimer before I begin exposing the situation: I\u2019m fully aware that it is a Doctor, a Physician, the person who has to prescribe and supervise the treatment, and actually there are two doctors I talk to regularly that know her and are aware of my grandma\u2019s dementia. They are the ones who treat her, prescribe meds to her, and I only suggest them some treatments that may help. We are all a team looking the best medication for my grandma. Luckily, the two doctors usually agree with me, but I want to keep it clear that it is always a doctor who prescribes the meds for her. I have some biomedical background knowledge due to my career, and I guess they perceive it. But anyway, I\u2019m not a doctor and I know it.\n\n**>The subject**: 92 year old woman, healthy, aside from the neurodegenerative disease, and a low bowel movement, which leads her to constipation. Takes light osmotic laxatives regularly, but I try to avoid any drug (like opiates or drugs with heavy anticholinergic side effects) that may lead her guts to totally stop working. She had a fecaloma a couple of years ago, when she stopped going to the bathroom for like 10-12 days. That is the only serious complication, so I have to avoid any drug with constipation as a side effect. \n\n**>The disease**: My grandma suffers from dementia, although we don\u2019t know what kind of dementia it is. It may be Alzheimer's, it may be dementia produced by Lewy bodies, it may be vascular dementia\u2026 We don\u2019t know, and we won\u2019t, because the public health doctor says it\u2019s worthless to make a tomography to a 92 years old woman, and probably wouldn\u2019t change the prospect of a better treatment for her illness.\n\n**>The problem**: The main problem and the reason I\u2019m writing this post, is my grandma doesn\u2019t sleep at night (she wakes us up at 3:30AM, 4AM, 5AM\u2026) and also she\u2019s agitated during the day, specially during the twilight and night, sees people in our home when there's no-one there, and she's obsessed in going back to her old home with her -dead- parents (she can no longer live on her own, obviously, so she lives with us). Some days she\u2019s quite chill, but others she starts hitting the main door because she wants to go away. She obviously doesn\u2019t know where she is anymore, and barely recognises us. Then she becomes stressed, and afraid, and sad. She either yells or cries.\n\nThe issue of her waking up in the middle of the night and wandering through the house (something that can lead to a fall, indeed she already fell one night), has been happening for the past 2 years, more or less, but it is getting worse. Thus, we cannot sleep properly at night due to the fear of her falling. We have to listen to her waking up, and then get up and go to lie her down again. Thus, we cannot rest properly at night. And NO, my grandma doesn\u2019t sleep during the day, and she is mildly active during the day. We spend most of the time with her so she is, at least, awake and talking (repeating the same questions over, and over, because she doesn\u2019t remember anything after 40 seconds).\n\n***Trying the first meds:***\n\nThis leads us to the main question: We need a medication for her. We have waited long enough because we didn\u2019t want to give her any psychotropic o neuroleptic drug, but is has arrived to a point where it is her or us, we cannot keep this way without sleeping at night. We need something to keep her from waking up at 3, 4, 5AM and wandering around (and falling). I have the feeling that the main cause is her sleep is not deep, or maybe after her first REM stage ends, she wakes. I don\u2019t know, but what I do know is that insomnia is a common issue for the elderly and dementia patients.\n\nSo, two months ago, we started to trying the medication that our doctors prescribed us. First we tried with a first generation antihistamine, **Hydroxycine**: no results after some weeks , then we tried with **Clometiazole**: It gave her a weird reaction, severe nasal and eye irritation, nose pain (sinus) and lots of mucus and secretion; this drug actually worked after the first hour of adverse reactions, but that was a long hour of pain for her. After three days, we decided to stop. \n\nThen we started with one antidepressant and one antipsychotic, and this have been the outcomes:\n\n**>Trazodone**: When we started with this antidepressant, trazodone; we actually thought this was going to be the perfect medication, as she is starting to cry due to her anxiety of not remembering anything. She\u2019s starting to have a depression, and some days she cries a lot. Thus, Trazodone would help her to be in a better mood and also help her sleep, as it is pretty sedative. Also, it barely has anticholinergic side effects so it wouldn\u2019t make her constipation worse. Perfect, right? \n\nWell, it turned out to be too sedative in the long run, and affected her mobility, as she wasn\u2019t able to walk. We started with 50mg per day, and at first she was pretty well, she spent all that night watching wires and people on the ceiling of her bedroom, and she didn\u2019t sleep until several hours after the first intake, from there on, she was sleeping all day, all evening, all night\u2026 to the point where she barely moved her feet. We have tried this medication on three occasions, during several days/weeks, even with lower dosage, but it always ends the same way: No movement and extreme sleepiness and lack of attention, with her eyes closed. And we don\u2019t want that for her. Also she\u2019s had a couple of syncopes where she didn\u2019t react at all during several minutes. \n\n**>Risperidone**: Well, this has been a more helpful drug, just a bit, although we were afraid of it killing her.  A lot of reviews talk about how dangerous antipsychotics are, but this is not Haloperidol, right? I\u2019ve read many bad things about Haloperidol and elder people that terrified me, so I asked my doctor to not give her a first generation antipsychotic. That\u2019s how he ended up prescribing her risperidone, and in theory, this is one of the antipsychotics with less anticholinergic side effects. Although I\u2019ve read it is not recommended it\u2019s use for more than 6 weeks. It can cause cerebrovascular accidents (strokes), so that\u2019s why I\u2019m afraid of it.\n\nIt did help, somewhat. I gave her the minimum dosage (0,25mL twice a day). She wasn\u2019t sleepy at day, she didn\u2019t have so many visions, she was calmer, and manageable, and she slept a bit better at night (well, most of nights she woke up only once or twice per night, but this was already better). This wasn\u2019t all days, but she got noticeably better overall. Maybe it was just luck, maybe placebo, or maybe it did help.\n\nBut even when risperidone doesn\u2019t have many anticholinergic (AC from now on) side effects, at least according to some sources that measure the amount of AC side effects among the different neuroleptics and antidepressants, my grandma got constipated after a week of treatment. I don\u2019t know if it was just bad luck, or risperidone actually had something to do with this. So after 5 days of no pooping , we stopped the treatment, and on the 8th day -and after giving her a lot of different laxatives-, she went to the bathroom, and we all were relieved. \n\n***New meds to try:***\n\nSo I\u2019m a bit afraid of asking our doctor to test a new sedative antipsychotic on her, like quetiapine, which he already has mentioned us before. **Quetiapine** has been on my spot for a long time, as it is the antipsychotic that is usually given to elderly to sleep, it has a short life of only 6-7 hours, and it has almost no negative side effects reported. BUT: Online anticholinergic scales give Quetiapine a high amount of AC side effects. And the last thing I need right now is having my grandma constipated again. \n\nThe other alternative I\u2019m considering to ask our doctor is **Mirtazapine**. Maybe it has the positive effects of Trazodone without affecting her mobility and awareness during day. From what I\u2019ve read, it doesn\u2019t have many AC side effects, but in some literature constipation is mentioned. \n\nAnd for the record, she eats fruits, like mangos and pears, and we make her drink water, barely 1,5L. We cannot make her drink more than that, as she hates drinking water and we need lots of patience and time to make her drink a glass of water. Trust me, I spend some hours a day making her eat, drink, and carrying her to the bathroom, as well as walking a bit. Its just simply her bowel is gradually getting slower\u2026 or maybe lazy due to the osmotic laxatives, but they are a must right now.\n\nSo, maybe Mirtazapine works and makes her sleep. Maybe it gives her constipation again. Or maybe it produces on her that dizziness and sleepiness during all day like Trazodone did. Or maybe it affects her ability to walk, like Trazodone did. \n\nSo I\u2019m open to considerate different, alternative sedatives that may help her sleep without giving her constipation as a side effect, and without taking away her ability to walk. \n\nAs a side note: sometimes, when she gets up from bed, she\u2019s been already awake for some time, but others she just wakes up all sleepy with her eyes closed. It is like something made her wake up even if she's half sleeping, and no, it is not pain. She just sleeps 3 and a half hours and then she\u2019s ready to wake up every hour or half an hour. \n\nWe need to make her sleep during, at least, 6 to 7 hours, for us to be able to rest and take care of her during the day, or work, or having a life, whatever (I need to sleep!!!). And again, we cannot make her be more active during day, because she already is and we spend most of the time with her. I say this because I'm already anticipating those \"physical activity and no sleep during the day\" comments, and this is not that scenario, as she is active and doesn't sleep during the day. She can't have a lot of physical activity tho, but at least she walks arround the house.\n\n***TL;DR:*** I know there\u2019s not a perfect pill for dementia and insomnia, but maybe you can give me a few more ideas aside from trazodone, risperidone, quetiapine, and mirtazapine, which doesn't have constipation or strokes as a side effect. Or maybe you can tell me a bit more about quetiapine or mirtazapine on elderly people before I try them on her.\n\nThank you.",

I do try to remove excess as much as possible, but sometimes I guess I can't 100%. But I'm not sure if that's the problem. I shower every day at night, and also after I wake up in the morning when I get ready, I change my underwear to a fresh one too.

        "text": "Age 82, female, 5'2\", 110 lbs, Caucasian,\nDuration of complaint: 1 year\nLocation: heart, feet, and ankles\nAny existing relevant medical issues: 1) hypertension, 2) at the time she was on high dose of atenolol (50mg 3 times/day, total 150mg/day for hypertension). I don't know how long she had been taking it, 3) She had been experiencing unexplained falls for a year or two, possibly because she took 150mg atenolol per day. (At the time I didn't know she was taking atenolol.)\n\nCurrent medications: Losartan, bumetanide, Aricept*, Gabapentin**\n\nHealth habits: \n\nShe and her husband walked their dogs one mile every day, at a medium-slow pace. She drank white wine and ate salads, chicken, salmon, fruit, and vegetables.\n\nIn February, 2016, an 82 year old woman was taken to the emergency room at a prestigious teaching hospital after falling with (probable) loss of consciousness. She had a 1.5 cm laceration on her scalp, which was the given reason for the ambulance (which a distant daughter had summoned in a fit of neurosis). The scene suggested that she'd hit her head on the edge of a door as she fell, and that she landed on a plush, padded carpet. She didn't get up until her husband finally found her. She was conscious but weak. She was conversant.\n\nShe was admitted not long after she arrived at the ER because she failed the orientation quiz, which asked her name (which she stated), her birthday (which she didn't state) and what city she was in (which she also didn't state). She hasn't known her birthday for decades, because she doesn't believe in celebrating them. It's a quirk, not a strange religious practice. Plus, she lives in a big county with many small cities, and ambulances have no windows.) \n\nShe underwent various tests, including x-rays and a CT-scan of her skull, ultrasound for deep-vein thrombosis, blood work, and ekg. She was given IV fluids. \n\nThe first mention of drugs is notes made on the morning of day two. A nurse called her pharmacy and was told or misheard that the woman was on 50 mg of Atenolol per day. Because she probably for none on the day she fell, and because that's a big dose reduction, it's possible that what happened next was she went experienced panic and anxiety as a symptom of atenolol withdrawal. The staff say she was combative and wanted to get out of bed in the morning. In that order. I didn't know you had to engage in hand-to-hand combat to get out of bed in a hospital these days, but times change.\n\nA resident ordered intramuscular haloperidol on the morning of day 2. The records only mention one injection, but when she got home two days later, a friend who visited said she looked \"drugged.\" \n\nSo the high dose of Atenolol and the abrupt drop from 150 mg to 50 mg is one drug event, and the haloperidol is another. I was wondering if the atenolol dose change, or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            the Iv haldol could gave caused\n\nGraphics and P.S.s\nWhen she got home, her feet were badly swollen. They'd be less swollen if she kept them elevated. They didn't get better, and she now takes bumdetanide. This link is to her blood work: http://pasteboard.co/Rgcehx7dE.png\n\nIt is a set of simple graphs showing the results of blood tests since 2012, in blue, and the results on Day 1 and Day 3 at the hospital.\n\nThis is a link to the heart test done on the day she was discharged, Day 3. http://pasteboard.co/5koufiyZ6.png\n\nIt also shows the list of drugs that might have been used in the hospital. Labetalol was definitely used at least once in the middle of the second night in the hospital. I don't know anything about the warfarin\n\n*The Aricept started last fall. I wish she were not on it.\n**The Gabapentin started recently, and was prescribed for very pain muscle cramps in her right hand. I wish she were not on it. When not cramping up, her hand feels both numb and tingly. That started  two weeks after she was prescribed the bumetanide. Apparently it's very a common side effect.",

        "text": "Please bear with me as this is a decent amount of information, and I'll try to make it as clear and concise as possible but I'm not at my most lucid. \n\nI take several preventatives for chronic migraine (150mg Effexor XR, 150mg Topiramate, .50mg Nabilone) but I still live with a daily baseline pain level and periodic flare-ups that I manage by temporarily increasing the Topiramate until I get back to baseline (sedation on Topiramate is a problem for me, especially in combo with the Effexor). \n\nThis past Monday evening, I had been going on a month with a flare-up, and increasing the Topiramate had not worked. So I decided to go into the ER to see if anything could be done acutely to break the migraine. I had eschewed ER visits after previously having no results from IV infusions of Toradol and DHE, but I was desperate since I'm in a demanding PhD program and my productivity is suffering; I couldn't (can't) tread water any longer after this past month. The doctor laid out his three-step plan to knock out the migraine: 1) Haloperidol 2) Propofol 3) A steroid that we didn't discuss specifics, probably prednisone.\n\nHe gave me the Haldol via IV. Pretty quickly I felt loopy. Very out of it and sedated. I had cabbed to the hospital, and I have issues with feeling out of control, so I told the nurse I wanted to be discharged, planning to go home and sleep it off. Ever since then, I've been sedated as all hell; can't keep my eyes open. I slept about 17 hours per day Tuesday and my waking hours were spent forcing myself to keep my eyes open. \n\nNow, I'm also taking Modafinil (100mg once per day, except weekends) to combat the sedation from the migraine preventative cocktail. Wednesday I decided I would take that and get back to my normal activities. It was like taking a placebo. Zero effect. I'm used to getting a little boost from that (I wake up quite hungover from the Topiramate each morning as I take 100-125mg at night so taking the Modafinil is like a cup of coffee for me), so this is when I thought \"something is quite abnormal here.\" I went back to the ER, and a different doc ran a blood panel (everything came back normal). He said I should just wait and that while this is unusual, I should start to feel better within 24-48 hours. \n\nSince then I've seen minor improvements. Like I'm able to type this out (with the help of Modafinil) but I'm dead tired most of the day and am sleeping 11 hours still. I plugged my drugs into an interaction checker, and Haldol has major interactions with both Topiramate and Effexor. Further researching the drug, Haldol slows the elimination of drugs that work on Serotonin and Dopamine receptors I believe? My (non-expert) opinion is that the ER doc perhaps wasn't conservative enough with the Haldol dose. So when I took my preventatives that same night, they were eliminated very slowly, so it was essentially like I was taking a mega dose. Then when I took the next day's dose of the meds, the concentration from the day before was higher than it normally would have been. And the next day added to it. So there's a sort of bottleneck, if you will, that needs to be cleared before I get returned to the level of the drug that I'm accustomed to. \n\nNow, my question is (finally! I'm sorry it took me so long to get there) is, does my conclusion make sense at all? It terrifies me to think this sedation will continue into next week, because if it does I'm going to have to talk to my program about accommodation. And there's a major project coming due soon that I'm afraid this will affect my standing greatly. So I'm in danger of slipping into a dark place if I don't take care of myself, and I'm trying to do just that by finding some hope. I don't know if I should go back into the ER tomorrow if I don't feel markedly better.",

The discussion with your care team should involve your pain levels and management, as well as managing any other uncomfortable symptoms such as shortness of breath or nausea. \n\nYou should also probably have a chat about your diet needs, especially wether or not you would like a feeding tube if at any point it becomes unsafe for you to eat normally, or if you become uninterested in food. Getting it or not getting it are fine, and the decision is yours to make, but it's best if it's an active decision ahead of time instead of trying to figure it out once it's already a problem. \n\nActivity levels should also be talked about, especially in terms of preventing bed sores and excessive atrophy. Depending on your oxygen needs, this may vary a lot. This discussion would probably be were you'd bring up getting some help writing those letters, which may come in the form of a nursing aide, a social worker, a counselor, or even a volunteer. \n\nIn terms of not being alone, you may want to bring up either a patient sitter (they are a thing, mostly for people who need some help with activities of daily living instead of a nurse to do wound care and medication management), a carer, or a death doula (which is there to help you communicate with your team, make your death what you want it to be, and advocate for your previously made decisions). Most of these people you would have to hire yourself, though some programmes do have them included. \n\nAnother bit that you may want to discuss is end of life planning and estate planning. Besides the legal considerations, there may come a point where you're unable to express your wishes or make decisions, and it's always best to have a written document, signed, that can guide your care at that point in time. Your team are probably experts in these matters. This usually includes talking about fluid management, anything you'd like to avoid once you lose consciousness, and any personal requests. It also includes talking about what happens with your body, as well as with your belongings, but that side of things is usually handled by either specialised social work or a lawyer. \n\nKeeping a record of your questions to ask your team as they come up is a good idea. A voice recorder, the voice to text function on your phone or a notebook if you can still write on your own are all good ways of remembering those things for when you have the chance to ask.",

That night he took off his oxygen while he was sleeping and passed in his sleep. But he wasn\u2019t \u201cready\u201d he was angry and my only regret for him is that he didn\u2019t find any peace. But I have never been dying, maybe that\u2019s just too hard to do. \nDo write letters, or record videos if it\u2019s easier. Say what you need to, this is the time. I am sorry you have to go through this and send you all the love you could want from an internet stranger.",

You are a young guy... not a lot of us get to know that this life is ending so far ahead. \n\nAs for hospice experience:\n\nI remember having patients in hospice (I was a hospital chaplain and we had an on-site facility for veterans). It was staffed with good folks, kind hearted, patient. But we all knew the score. Every effort was made to be upfront about what was coming and to make the patients as comfortable and safe feeling as possible. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask for the chaplain. If he/she is worth even a nickel they will be exactly who and what you need. I always saw myself as the only member of the staff guaranteed not to hurt anyone. I was just there to be kind, to advocate when needed, to simply walk alongside. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask for someone to hold your hand, or simply be with you. Some of my most cherished memories are of being asked to be present as this life drew to a close. \n\nI pray that you are well, that you meet the end of your journey in this world as gracefully, courageously and peacefully as anyone can. \n\nI\u2019ll be sure to remember you tonight when we say our prayers before bed.\n\nEdit: my 3yo just said that he hopes that you \u201cwalk up the stairs to heaven.\u201d",

During her final month of life,  she was given methadone by the hospice, and it made her sleep a lot. She passed away in her sleep with me next to her, and it was a very peaceful transition. I do believe she was asleep when she was taking her last breaths as she did not have any symptoms that would lead me to believe that she was struggling in pain.  I sure wish I knew you, I would sit with you during your transition, too. Lots of love your way.\n\nImportant to note in hospice,  they will bring your medicine to you. Another redditor said they had to go to the pharmacy to get their methadone. You will not, your hospice nurse will get an order straight from a hospice doctor, and deliver it to you.\n\nI recommend getting a walker and a wheel chair for when you become too weak to use your legs. The hospice should provide these items. I really hate cancer. Please message me if needed and I will tell you everything you can expect to happen to your body. If you would prefer not to know, I dont blame you.",

But I wanted to throw my hat in the ring too. I went through this with my mother, I have some good experience of dealing with the the admin side of things too. I am also currently unemployed, so I've got the time. If you need me to video call you, just reach out, I'm here. \n\nPlease consider calling Marie Curie. They were so valuable when my mum was dying. \n\nYou know where I am if you need someone.\n\nEdited to add some practical information. With regards to pain relief, in the early days my mum was getting top up morphine shots from either District nurses (NHS between the hours of about 8am and 4pm), or Marie Curie nurses during the hours that the district nurses weren't available. I imagine this will be different depending on your area and NHS trust though. I would often call Marie Curie out late at night. This became more and more frequent, so we made the decision to get her on a syringe driver, which helped massively. The district nurse would just come out every morning and refill it. \n\nI'm not sure what the criteria is for getting a syringe driver. My memory is a little foggy after 5 years. But it's important that you look into that option and discuss it with your care team.",

If someone from palliative can't do it, I hope someone else in your area could come. No one should die alone. I hope you find peace and that the meeting is good. My dad died from the same thing as you, and he had good pain management and a peaceful passing once it got to that. My heart wants to say a lot more, but there are no words. Please rest and get the answers you need tomorrow.",

The dose is just increased once breakthrough pain is indicated. Nobody cares that the dose is habit forming once you're terminal. You having a morphine tolerance may mean you need a larger dose but you will get it. No questions asked.\n\nE just a note these meds are for dying phase and are sub cutaneous injections rather than oral. There are oral options but final phase terminal patients can be too weak or otherwise unable to swallow. Oramorph is a liquid pain killer and midazolam is available as a liquid. Also make sure you have laxatives available in case you need them can save a huge discomfort and loperimide (helps prevent loose stools) is a good idea too.",

Just depends on your tastes, but I have often found respite and escape via awesome music. I'd be happy to recommend from my own personal playlist but I suspect my taste might not be yours as I'm pretty boring.\n\nBut were it me, I'm partial to songs by Pentatonix.

        "comment": "It's absolutely not hopeless. I believe I read somewhere that the average smoker tries to quit around 5 times before it sticks. Also, if you can quit this year, your risk of smoking-related death will decrease by [**90%**.](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/lung-cancer/former-smoker-whats-your-risk-for-lung-cancer) If you take a few more years, you're still going to reduce those risks substantially. So, you're just a bit late, but far from screwed. \n\nI quit cold turkey for six months a few times. I know it was a government site, though I can't recall which one, that had a chart showing that lung cancer risk was about the same for smokers and non-smokers until around age 50, when the risk to smokers shoots up. It also stated that 15 years after quitting, the risk of heart disease (and I think also cancer?) would go down to that of someone who never smoked. So, I figured that meant as long as I quit before I turned 35, I was in okay shape. I went from smoking to vaping, and quit from there permanently. It's too early to know how my nonsense theory of how this would all work is going to play out, but so far so good.\n\nFor me, switching to vaping gave me time to cut down the nicotine while simultaneously growing to dislike both  the idea of having to stop what I'm doing to go outside and smoke, and the smell and taste of cigarettes. \n\nThen, once I got to a low enough amount of nicotine, I was able to convince myself that the cost wasn't worth just sucking nothing-vapor. I hope this is helpful to you in some way. You can quit, and there's no shame in having to try a few times to make it. Good luck!!!\n\nNinja edit: paragraph breaks! Yikes!",

So even if it\u2019s half assed, just keep trying, even if you immediately start again. Eventually it\u2019ll just be easier to stay quit.",

I've been smoke free for 9 months and nicotine free for 6 months now, I'm 32 and smoked somewhat heavily since I was 16. Do I still think about cigarettes? Yes!

Those massive sub-ohm vapes (a friend calls them \u201crobot dicks\u201d) were just too much for me. \n\nBut recently I tried the smaller ones that people are talking about here, and it\u2019s been an entirely different experience. I actually started with a JUUL just because it was the least amount of work from what I could tell, but when I switched to a SMOK Nord 2 I\u2019ve been so happy with it I never looked back! \n\nSince then I\u2019ve gone from the salt nic at 50mg down to the regular juice at 12mg and now 6mg. Planning on dropping to 3 soon and so on.\n\nI\u2019m 29 and I\u2019ve also smoked since 14 \u2014 and we\u2019re not talking one or two here and there, we\u2019re talking spent my lunch money on a pack of smokes every single day\n\nThe gum and patches never worked for me and I think the reason is because there isn\u2019t a substitute for inhaling something thicker than air into your lungs. There is definitely an anxiety-reducing element to playing with smoke in that way, so for now the vape covers that as well as the underlying nicotine addiction. I\u2019m glad I finally found a vape that I could get down with, because when I first tried to get into it I could not understand why everyone else seemed fine sucking on these ridiculous robot dicks and dealing with all the problems and upkeep (and I\u2019m gay so the sucking and dick shape were not the issue).\n\nHope you find something that works for you! The one I got was 40 bucks and it\u2019s like a 900mah battery or something crazy in a little, light, sturdy stick machine. I really dig it! And I know my mom and dad and my sisters are so happy every time they hug me and I don\u2019t reek like cigarettes. Smoking killed my dad\u2019s mom at 52 years old so I\u2019m trying to avoid that for myself.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the essay but I wish you the best!",

I haven't gotten them yet, but I used to get horrible and literally traumatic episodes of uncontrollable eye and neck movements due to antipsychotics. \n\nCan you guys share your thoughts and experiences with chlorpromazine?

        "text": "This will probably be a long post. \n\nJust to get you into the right context: I'm twenty-two at the moment and I live in Russia. Actually turning twenty-two in two weeks. I don't know what I'm suffering from, but I feel like I'm going to lose control sooner or later. \n\nI want to first tell you about my childhood because that's where it all started. I guess I was a happy boy until I turned eleven or twelve. My parents divorced when I was five, but it's a pretty normal thing for Russia. Half of my friends' parents were already divorced by the time, the other half divorced later. My parents continued living together for a while after they broke up. Sometimes dad had to leave the house because of another quarrel my mom gave him, but he would always come back in a week or two. I only remember seeing them fight once, though they were screaming at each other really often. After my dad lost his job and our family started to run out of money, my mom finally decided that he had to leave for good. So he did. She started searching for a man and working at two jobs in the meantime. After a while, she found some rich guy and they got married. After I turned ten or eleven I started hanging out with some spoiled kids, around the same time I discovered cigarettes and alcohol. I was drinking insanely huge amounts of alcohol and somehow I was able to hide it for quite a long time. I guess that's where my *problem* started to develop. I remember being a very emotional kid, like, *really emotional.* I would cry for no reason, laugh, too. I laughed a lot, some people even thought that I was fucked in the head and started avoiding me. So my circle of friends started to shrink and I was left with a few of the most freaky ones. \n\nAround the same time, my studying in school went downhill. You see, I've been a really smart kid back then in terms of studying, grades and stuff. I was only getting A+(s) and was always ahead of the class in every subject. I started reading when I was like three and my mother started showing me to her friends as if I was some fucking exhibit. She always told me that she and my dad always wanted to rise a genius and were preparing for my birth for two years, she always prised my mental abilities and told me that I have to become someone significant, that I'm *the chosen one* and other stuff like that. So, when I was twelve there was no genius left in me, I was drinking frequently, some cheap booze they sold in those small shops. One time I've bought myself a bottle of gin (not an actual gin, it was a slang word for the cheapest kind of alcohol available, it's like juice mixed with pure ethanol, it was around 8%) and drank it all alone in the forest behind the school. That was the first time I felt dissociation. Everything just zoomed out and the world started to look like a photograph, I felt like I'm not there at all, like I don't even exist. I rushed home, I was so freaked out that I sat in the corner and kept silence for three or four hours. Even when my mom tried to talk to me I didn't answer. After I recovered a little, I told my parents about what happened (my dad didn't live with us, obviously, but he lived in the same town). They didn't take me seriously, but after some time they brought me into some kind of a private clinic and I've got inspected by a shrink. This woman gave me a prescription for Phenibut and put down a nonexistent (literally, there's no such thing even in Russian classification) diagnosis. After like two months on the medication I got better and every symptom was gone. A year later my mother left the house to live with her new husband leaving me and my younger brother (I forgot to mention him, he's 16 now and lives a happy life) alone. She visited us daily, but I had to watch my brother all the time as he was just a little kid with absolutely no brains. I can't say I didn't enjoy living on my own by the time, because I could do everything I wanted with no restrictions.\n\nAround the time when I turned fourteen, I fell in love with a girl, this time for real. Shit was strong, I was obsessed with her. She seemed like a loner, just as I was, and this thing about her was the most appealing I guess. We started dating, but after a while I dropped her. That was funny because two weeks later I came back begging her to be with me again. Well, we got together again, though our relationship has started to decay from this point. After a year and a half, when I was sixteen, she would \"break up\" with me every two months, ignore my calls and messages, and all this stuff was just driving me crazy. I became really anxious and sometimes even paranoid. I was the opposite of \"confident\" around her. I was just shaking. \n\nWhen I turned seventeen, I had to prepare for my final exams in school which were taking place in the next year. I and that girl I mentioned were still \"dating\" and my anxiety was on the highest level possible. So one day I was in a car with my dad who volunteered to drive me to school this morning and everything just went blank. No feelings, no emotions, no people, no engine humming, no white snow on the trees, no forest. Well, everything was still there but it has transferred in a totally different state of existence. I just could not *feel* it. It was blank. Like chewing paper. No taste, no color, nothing. And this time it didn't go away in two months. It stayed. \n\nWhen I was a child, I was always shamed by my parents if I showed any signs of weakness, so I was silent about what happened for the first two or three weeks. But then this thing became unbearable and I told them everything. I knew exactly what was happening to me, because when I was fifteen or sixteen I started reading books dedicated to psychiatry, psychoanalysis and general psychology. I knew I was depersonalized and I even had my guesses where it was rooting from. First, I went to the doctor my uncle suggested to me. He was a therapist, and that was an analytical kind of therapy. It didn't help. I started getting severe panic attacks and developed persistent anxiety. It got to the point where I just went to the clinic and asked if they could take me for a treatment, but they said that all the places were taken. In Russia, nuthouses are like prisons and that's not an overstatement. They are literally like prisons and sometimes even worse, but this one was fine. But they couldn't take me. I've had another option but in this clinic they only had one decent(well, bearable) department out of sixteen and I was not ready to risk. I was told at the first clinic that I have to wait for one month and then they can take me in. One month was too long. Each day my anxiety grew and I could not stand it anymore. I just called the second clinic and they told me that I could come tomorrow. I got lucky and was assigned to the decent department. At this point my anxiety was so bad I couldn't really talk and just agreed on everything the shrink said. \n\nI amnesized first two weeks in a nuthouse and I still can't remember a single thing out of what was happening to me in this period. My mom, who visited me frequently, later told me that I was walking like a zombie wearing a diaper moaning instead of talking and sleeping for 24 hours straight. After they let me go I discovered that the first day I got there they injected me I/V with a massive dose of antipsychotics and benzos because they have though I was in a state of psychosis. After the two weeks, I regained my consciousness and was able to talk again (just a little bit tho). I asked what medication they put me on but they refused to answer telling me that was for my own safety. I knew that if I would start complaining they would just strap me to the bed with the belts and inject me with chlorpromazine just as they did to other patients so I've decided to stay quiet. Later I discovered that I was put on Risperidone which was later changed for Zyprexa. I stayed in this place for three months, and not because I wanted to, but because they didn't let me go. My mom could not do anything about it, neither. My anxiety actually lowered a little but I was feeling like a complete zombie. When I was still in the clinic I found a shrink who was also a professor, like the best shrink in a region. He was a really good man, the first time we met we were talking about jazz for an hour before starting talking on the topic of my illness. He was kind of *the* *main guy* in the clinic and he told the shrink at my department to switch my medication to Clozapine and add SSRIs. Also he suggested him using some other meds like lithium. When I was finally free from the nuthouse I was on a ton of medication but my state at least became bearable. I've lost around 44 pounds in three months even though I was fed with tremendous amounts of antipsychotics all the time. That was just because they didn't feed us well. They actually didn't have any money to feed us well. \n\nSo... When I got home my mom told me that there's almost no time left until the exams and that I have to study in order to pass them. I guess I don't need to tell you I didn't want to. I just wanted some rest. But I was forced to, because she and my step-dad told me that if I don't enter the university they stop giving me money for food and stuff and I will have to find a job. Don't get me wrong tho, my mother is a good person, she was just lost and thought that if I don't do anything at all my mental state will only worsen, and my step-dad was putting pressure on her also, he didn't understand shit, he thought that mental illness is like a bad mood or something and that it's just *in my head.*  So I had no choice. I just picked the subjects I was best at, took some private lessons to improve my chances on the exams and passed them successfully. Actually I even got high enough score to apply to several universities in the closest big city on a free basis, but I chose the most prestigious one and my step-dad paid for my first year.  It got worse after that. I was still on antipsychotics, so I didn't have much anxiety, but every day I was getting more and more depressed and apathetic. I started skipping classes, but my initial knowledge allowed me to go through the first year without getting kicked out. By the end of that year I started drinking frequently again, got dragged into the bad company where all the people were using (mostly uppers), and my good friend who was renting a flat with me got dragged in there too. I managed to stay off the hard drugs which he didn't and I still feel sorry for that. My feelings started to fade more and more, even though I thought that I've had none of them left. It was like, everything in this world had some feeling to it. The chair, the room, the sound of wind or laughter. A very specific feeling. And all those emotional shades started to decay more and more, every day I felt less alive and it was frightening me. I still had all the basic feelings aside from pleasure, like fear and fury or even sadness (which was the best feeling I could experience but even sadness was a rare thing, mostly it was fear), but the absence of those emotional semitones made me feel less real and less human. I was constantly telling my mom I want to drop out of university and just have some rest, maybe get off meds which were causing too much side effects (in two years time I became morbidly obese), but she could not let me do that, mainly because of my step-dad who has paid for my studying. On the third year of studying (by that time I transferred to another faculty which was easier in terms of subjects and all) I've managed to get off meds. I went through terrible withdrawals. Clozapine withdrawal just made me see things and didn't let me sleep for three to four days in a row and SSRIs... Well I can't even imagine anything worse than Venlafaxine withdrawals. That was just one and a half months of pure hell. But I went through it. I went to the gym and lost some weight and as my mother said back then became a lot more alive, but after I stopped taking clozapine I've developed persistent insomnia. I didn't want to go back on meds so I turned to smoking weed every night to help me fall asleep. At first, it was working, but then I've started abusing it. For seven months I smoked a gram per three days and was stoned all the time aside from the time when I was studying. My emotions kept fading. Sometimes I experienced a rush of motivation but mostly I was really apathetic. I've managed to quit weed but my state didn't get better. Well, maybe my studying did, but that's all. Around the time I've started smoking pot I've also started researching all the stuff about Buddhism and all, my worldview has changed drastically and now I think of reality just the way any regular acid user does. But it didn't help either. I'm thankful for one thing - I found a person who I think was meant for me. She is supportive and kind, although she has her problems, too. If it wasn't for her I think I would be dead by now. But even though I love her, I don't feel that I love her, neither do I feel anything else. Just anxiety and fear, dread, sometimes. I've got nervous tics (is that how I call them?) and because of them it always looks like I'm making faces, also one of my teeth is going to fall out soon because I'm clenching my jaw too much. It always feels like there are thousands of thoughts going through my head at once and I can't really focus on one of them. I don't know what to do because my three-year experience with meds was terrible (I think I've tried almost every popular antipsychotic and antidepressant out there) and the last time I was trying to do therapy the guy just told me he could not help after like fifteen sessions and eight hundred bucks later. The only thins which gave me the feeling I am craving for, that feeling of comfort and reality were light opioids like codeine and kratom, but I don't want to engage in that kind of stuff either because I know it won't end well. I'm still hopeful, tho. I really do think that life is about balance and when this agony ends I will be happier than ever, but now I guess I just want to talk it all out and maybe get some advice. \n\nTo the one who reads this until the end: firstly, - thank you. And secondly, - sorry for the dramatic writing and all those parcellations, lol. I didn't even notice *how* I was writing this text. I used to write short stories so I guess it's just a habit. And sorry for all the mistakes in the text, too. I know there are tons of them as I'm usually unable to even formulate my thoughts in Russian properly when I'm writing for so long. If you hurt just as I do - don't lose your hope, ever. I can't explain why, but, well... Just don't. Gonna go to bed now. So good night to anyone who reads this. I wish you all well.",

Does anyone know the best way to make sure they won't be able to find me. Will they be able to read what I say on reddit? If so I'll have to delete this account. \n\nDoes anyone know how to trick blood tests to show anti psychotics levels in blood?\n\nWhat should I do the last 2 days my mind is slipping and I don't wanna go through psychosis.  I think it's coming because my mum says I'm really delusional again but I can't trust her my friend says I'm fine. But last night I had 2 minor hallucinations which where not bad but its usually a sign of bad things happening.\n\nCan I be tracked if I move city or does warrants work through counties (I'm in England)\n\nI'm gunna snap. Iv been forced to take the 100mg that I missed last night and the 200 that I missed at dinner time all at once so I'm drugged up atm but have not felt this paranoid since I first started taking chlorpromazine 5 years ago.  My friend keeps laughing at something then looking at me, what would the benefit for him be if he grassed me in?\n\nI can't even go home to pack because my mums there and she will ring the police.",

        "title": "Person Meets Unreality: My Struggles with Mental Illness",
        "text": "I am a 26 year old that has a very firm diagnosis of schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder, with a plethora of documented traits of other ailments. I am by no means fully recovered and/or in remission, but I am more stable now than I have ever been. It is tough to remind myself of that because I'm still struggling. It has been a long, hard road to get to where I am today and I would like to talk about my journey. \n\nI had already had BPD symptoms from adolescence onwards (chronic traumas lead me there), but my psychotic symptoms started to poke through in my late teens. I am mostly going to touch on my experience in having a psychotic illness.\n\nAs a teen I was showing signs of the prodromal phase, having appeared to have blunted affect, and several negative symptoms most often confused for depression: lack of pleasure, lack of drive & motivation, poor hygiene, etc. When my psychosis had started to hit, the very first thing I experienced just before, were waves of dissociation in the form of derealization. This in turn lead me to develop some odd beliefs and behaviours. (Continued)\n\nMy longest running delusion probably lasted about 10 years and at times I fall back into old ways of thinking. I believed this world is just a simulation. It didn't stop there, no, it was a simulation of a simulation spanning infinitely--with no alpha or omega. A cluster of cells within cells within other cells, a strand of a braid of a bigger braid in other braids. I was obsessed with infinity and swore that was God (despite never being particularly religious beforehand). I believed entities were running this simulation and were making my life a living hell every single day. The people within the simulation were mostly NPCs which I called White Noise Nonpeople, as they were just there to fill the space. They all knew me and everything about me, and were in on the entities ploy against me. This is how systematized my main delusional theme had become. \n\nI would hear voices embedded in the background of the simulation, much like how we used to embed songs into websites back in the day. They would give me keys of information to this simulated universe--while others taunted me for my craziness at times. \n\nMy biggest psychotic break was sometime after I moved out of my parents place, from my hometown to Toronto (Canada). My mother died and months later my father died which lead me to abuse a plethora of drugs. I was already becoming psychotic, but this tipped the iceberg for me. I was abusing everything, especially hallucinogens, stimulants, and cannabis. I was dating a drug dealer from the rave scene I partied in for several years. He abused me, but that is neither here nor there. (Continued)\n\nI had just had a really bad trip days before, then continued to use drugs afterward. I was in and out of the hospital and noncompliant with the medication I was prescribed on and off (chlorpromazine AKA thorazine). They finally decided I should be on depot antipsychotic injections. The day came for me to go to the clinic to get my injection from a nurse, and all I wanted was for her to prove she was real. I had a knife and pulled it out, mumbling to myself I guess. I wanted to see that she bled red to prove she was a living person. \n\nNeedless to say, I had an automatic admission to the hospital. This is where I met my current psychiatrist. I was hiding under a blanket because I thought the radiation from the lights in the hospital was messing with me. My doctor was sweet as pie then, we chatted, but I don't know if I made total sense. I agreed to get the injection. I was in the psychiatric intensive care unit in East York, as I lived in the east end of Toronto then. \n\nI remember pacing a lot as that part of the ward was very small. I kept refusing the oral meds because I received my first injection right away, only because I didnt know what they were and he never said I was being prescribed it at the time. Eventually things got clearer. I continued to smoke pot when I had day passes. He became my outpatient psychiatrist too. (Continued)\n\nDuring my stay and even time afterward I had zero thoughts and no internal dialogue. I told him about this while in the hospital, and he asked me an interesting question: \"But how can you talk, then?\" And I explained, \"I don't ever think about what I am saying, speech comes naturally.\" \n\nThe thoughts started to return. I would end up in and out of the hospital since then still. He had put me on a community treatment order, which I followed. My stays were mostly because of still being psychotic. \n\nI watched a certain TV channel all day every day, to the point it was driving me crazy. I saw tidbits of my life being aired on TV, to let me know they were watching me. I thought the news anchor Ken Shaw was involved in all this, so I thought I had to kill him to get it to stop. I didn't want to hurt anyone, so I dragged my own ass to the ER. The police were notified about my beliefs and wete informed of my discharge when I left. I had to speak to detectives sometime after. (Continued)\n\nThese are just the most prominent things I can remember, I had a lot of stuff happen in between, before, and after. It's all a blur for most of it though.\n\nI kept ending up in hospital to the point I almost got sent  to a maximum security asylum known as Ontario Shores in Whitby. Luckily for me I improved some, was the longest hospital stay thus far. I spent a third of that year in and out of hospital.\n\nI ended up needing two different depot injections that alternated just to keep me stable and avoiding last resort treatments. My hospital stays have been years apart, but they do still happen. I am stable enough to go back to school, and am doing so. I no longer really hear voices, unless I am in certain environments which cause anxiety levels to rise. My beliefs are just thoughts now, though I know something is up when I start obsessing over them again. I still struggle with negative symptoms, however I am using my support team to help me with this. I am so close to getting on with my life, but I am more stable now than I have ever been. No longer homeless, rarely using any drugs, broke my dependence on cannabis. All that is left to tackle is dealing with the traumas and personality problems, which have undoubtedly added and fed the mix. I hope to become a doctor someday.\n\nThank you.",

Are you taking any medication/drugs/ anything?\n\nyou mentioned withdrawal from venlafaxine as horrible....I am on it ...125 mg...people say it is horrible drug to come off from..can you tell me more about it?",

I'm off meds now, I don't abuse any drugs or alcohol, but I do drink once or twice a week, I'd say three or four beers, just to ease the pressure. I'm depressed and anxious, but it's mostly manageable. I'm planning on finishing university this year and trying to get into the European one, probably in Germany, I hope that moving from the country will help. I haven't heard of EMDR, maybe I did but I just don't know how an English abbreviation sounds like, I will look into it. As for Venlafaxine, I was just depressed and got terrible brain zaps. In the first two weeks they were just unbearable and I could not function at all, I was mostly lying in a bed with my eyes closed. Also persistent insomnia, sleep paralysis, but I doubt you will get them. Brain zaps are common tho.",

Hey after all you went thru you are doing amazing!\n\n and indeed you have \"some brains\" hahah...I enjoy your writing and self awareness. Try reading about Complex posttraumatic stress disorder. This can help you put a finger on your diagnosis. Dissociative disorder (at least some version of it) could be also a thing right? anyhow...good luck to you! you are super strong and capable - dont forget that.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. **Role of Dopamine in Consciousness**: Studies with dopamine-deficient mice suggest that dopamine signaling is crucial for the expression of consciousness. Dopamine-deficient mice exhibit deficits in attention, learning, memory, and motivation, despite being awake and responsive to stimuli. Restoration of dopamine signaling restores most behaviors, indicating the importance of dopamine in maintaining consciousness.\n2. **Association Between Dopamine and Spirituality**: The paper discusses the relationship between dopamine and spiritual experiences, particularly during meditation. PET studies show a significant increase in dopamine release during meditation practices such as Yoga Nidra. This suggests that dopamine plays a role in the neurochemical processes underlying spiritual practices and experiences.\n3. **Impact of Dopamine on Religiosity**: There is a proposed link between dopamine function, specifically within the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), and religiosity. Hypoactivity of the medial PFC may result in decreased religiosity, characterized by reckless behavior, self-indulgence, and impaired theory of mind. Conversely, hyperactivity of the medial PFC may lead to heightened religiosity, marked by rigid conformity, excessive self-concern, and overinterpretation of others' thoughts.\n4. **Potential Psychotic Effects of Dopamine Modulation**: The paper suggests that dopamine modulation, along with other neurochemical changes induced by meditation, can lead to psychotic states. Increased dopamine, along with other neurotransmitters like serotonin and DMT, may contribute to schizophrenomimetic effects and psychotic-like experiences during meditation.\n\nIn summary, the evidence presented supports the idea that dopamine levels can influence self-awareness, conscious experience, and spirituality. Changes in dopamine function may impact cognitive processes, emotional regulation, and perception, ultimately affecting one's sense of self and spiritual experiences.  \n\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nReference:  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4737196/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4737196/)\n\n>  \nDopamine improved the prediction by subjective awareness of objective  performance in an online task with minimal self\u2010awareness (noetic  metacognition). Dopamine also enhanced extended self\u2010awareness with  introspection (autonoetic metacognition) concomitant with stimulation of  the anterior cingulate/prefrontal cortex, a process which seems to be  tightly linked to incentive stimulation and reward\n\n  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839810/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839810/)\n\n>  \nThe neural correlates of consciousness are largely unknown but many neural circuits are likely to be involved. Our experiments with mice  that cannot synthesize dopamine suggest that dopamine signaling is a  critical component necessary for the expression of consciousness.  Although dopamine-deficient mice are awake and respond to many stimuli,  they are unmotivated and have profound deficits in all but the simplest  learning tasks. Dopamine-deficient mice are unable to attend to salient  sensory information, integrate it with prior experience, store it in  long-term memory, or choose appropriate actions. While clearly conscious  from a general anesthetic point of view, dopamine-deficient mice have  marginal arousal and appear to be virtually unconscious from a  behavioral point of view. Restoration of dopamine signaling within the  striatum by viral gene therapy strategies restores most behaviors.  Therefore, I propose that dopaminergic modulation of glutamatergic  inputs from the cortex and thalamus onto medium spiny neurons in the  striatum contributes to cognition and the expression of consciousness.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190564/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190564/)\n\n>  \nThe role of spirituality as a resource for finding meaning and hope in suffering has also been identified as a key component in the process of psychological recovery. Most studies have shown that religious  involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes,  including greater longevity, coping skills and health-related quality  of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression and  suicide  \n\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>A study conducted on students in a large metropolitan area showed that  religious factors were strongly associated with lower drug abuse, even  after controlling for the relevant socio-demographic and educational  variables.  The role of spirituality in addiction was also reflected upon in a  study, which found that smoking and frequent binge drinking were  negatively correlated with spirituality scores  \n\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Most of the studies examining them used functional imaging as the  investigation tool, to delineate the neural mechanisms involved in these  practices. They include the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies  on Yoga, Tantric Yoga and Yoga Nidra; the Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (MRI) study on Kundalini Yoga; and the Single Photon Emission  Computerized Tomography (SPECT) study on Tibetan meditation. The studies  point to prefrontal activation, transient hypofrontality, increased  frontal lobe and decreased parietal lobe activity and also to a  deafferentation of the posterior superior parietal lobule (PSPL) in  spirituality  \n\\[...\\]  \nThere is substantial evidence from the psychology of religion to  suggest that people are prepared \u2018for religious experiences and this  readiness\u2019 is probably mediated by the dorsomedial frontal cortex,  leading to the commonly reported felt immediacy of religious experience.  The experience, however, becomes religious when people consciously  identify the experience as consistent with their own religious schema.  This cognitive process most probably involves the dorsolateral,  prefrontal and medial parietal cortex. Therefore, the prefrontal regions  mediate both the preparedness of religious experience and conscious  cognitive process involved in the appreciation of religious experience  \n\\[...\\]  \nFurther, it is proposed that a balanced function of the medial PFC is  needed to maintain balanced religious activities. The specific functions  involved in this regulation of religion are those mediating compliance  to rules and customs, self-reflection and the understanding of thoughts  and feelings of others with compassion and empathy (theory of mind).  Theory of mind (ToM) or mentalization is the ability to recognize that  someone else has a mind different from one's own. It involves the  ability to infer someone else's mind by facial expression, tone of voice  and non-verbal communication.  \n\\[...\\]  \nThe medial PFC is involved in error detection and monitoring and  compliance to social norms and therefore is involved in mediating  compliance to rules and customs. The medial PFC along with the posterior  cingulate is involved in self-reflective thought and this helps the  person to have an insight into his own experience and the perception of  self in relation to the divine being. The third regulatory function,  which includes the theory of mind, involves the medial PFC, especially  the orbitofrontal cortex, the lesion of which impairs theory of mind  tasks. Based on this it is hypothesized that the hypofunction of the  medial PFC results in decreased religiosity (hyporeligiosity). This  would result from a combination of reckless and lawless behaviour  (impaired error detection), self-indulgence (loss of self reflection)  and an inability to consider the thoughts of others (impaired theory of  mind). Hyperfunction of the medial PFC, on the other hand, will lead to  rigid conformity with rules and customs, excessive concern over oneself  and one's existence and excessive interpretation of the mind of others,  all of which results in heightened religiosity (hyperreligiosity)  \n\\[...\\]  \nThe dopaminergic system, via the basal ganglia, is involved in cortical  subcortical interactions and a PET study on the dopaminergic tone in  Yoga Nidra using 11 C-raclopride showed significant increase of dopamine  during meditation.  During meditation, 11C-raclopride binding in ventral striatum decreased  by 7.9%. This corresponds to a 65% increase in endogenous dopamine  release  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \nMeditation can induce psychotic states via mechanism such as increased 5HT2  receptor activation, increased DMT, increased NAAG and increased  dopamine. The mechanisms include the 5HT inhibition of LGB, the  hallucinogenic effects of DMT, the dissociative hallucinogenic effects  of NAAG and the action of increased dopamine in the temporal lobe. A  variety of schizophrenomimetic effects can be seen as a result of these  complex neurochemical changes.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "text": "Hi friends, i feel like I\u2019m being tortured.\n\nI was previously dx\u2019d with narcolepsy, i slept long nights and fell asleep multiple times through the day. I did the sleep test with all the wires and everything. I was put on modafinil, then armodafinil, and finally was given sunosi. I stopped taking the sunosi at some point and it seemed like I didn\u2019t need it anymore, or at least not as much, or maybe I just wasn\u2019t bothered by my narcolepsy anymore, I forget. \n\nThen a few months ago, not only was I staying awake through the day, but I couldn\u2019t stay asleep through the night. I keep waking up constantly and can\u2019t get more than a couple of hours.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s being caused by my narcolepsy meds or the lack of them, I\u2019ve gone thru periods on and off them and it has had no effect, and this started after I\u2019d been off them for a while.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m also schizoaffective, but I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m manic or hypomanic.\n\nI hadn\u2019t started any new medications around when this happened, and I was fine and stable, not depressed or anxious, and I was still relatively fine and stable for a while, but it\u2019s been catching up w me for a while now, and is at its worst now with the new sleeping med I\u2019m on.\n\nI\u2019ve tried (in no particular order):\nHydroxizine \nalprazolam/xanax\nWeed\nOlanzapine/zyprexa\nQuetiapine/seroquel\nClonazepem/klonopin\nGabapentin\nBuspirone\nchlorpromazine\nClonidine/catapres\n(A couple of these I took Clonidine + other med since the Clonidine at least seems to help me fall asleep, but tbh I don\u2019t think I was having trouble falling asleep before, just staying asleep.)\n\nI\u2019m also on caplyta for schizoaffective, but I have been for a long time before all this.\n\nAnd I\u2019m currently a few days into Clonidine + Eszopiclone/lunesta\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely the worst med I\u2019ve been on so far. I\u2019m getting less sleep than ever and it\u2019s all catching up to me so fast now, but I have to stay on this for a week before I can try anything else. I\u2019m losing hope now though that anything will work. I can\u2019t keep living like this. I would so so much prefer to have my narcolepsy back. How is this even possible?\n\nI\u2019ve always slept with ear plugs (the pressure in my ears helps me sleep) and a sleep mask.  I keep my screens in \u201cnight mode\u201d at night (night mode even used to tire out my eyes or something and make me sleepier). I\u2019m started trying to eat better in the middle of this in case that would help. I go to bed at 9pm every night and set my alarm for 9am (but have often been waking up earlier). I sleep in a cold room since that\u2019s always helped and is apparently scientifically proven to help. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong.\n\nI don\u2019t think it has to do with where I\u2019m sleeping either. Doesn\u2019t seem to matter if I\u2019m at my parents\u2019, at my dorm, or at my friends\u2019 places.\n\nAnyone else have this problem w Lunesta? Anyone else have similar stories?",

        "text": "I have been on various subreddits the past week complaining about my anti-psychotics, basically i was court ordered to take Clozapine 5 months ago because of a severe schizophrenic episode. Before this i was happily prescribed to Chlorpromazine and managed with it, but this Clozapine is fucking with me badly and my doctor refuses to switch pills or reduce the dosage.\n\nMy friend suggested to stop taking them and assured me DMT or Ayahuasca was a miracle drug for schizophrenia so iv been asking drug subreddits all i can about psychedelics and schizophrenia and people say to never take it because i could be in a permanent psycosis episode which if its bullshit or not is too scary to try.\n\nSo i'm stuck. I'm going to go cold turkey off the pills and therapy and psychiatrists, I have only had 2 non paranoid schizophrenic episodes and a handful of delusions in that last 5 months iv been forced to take Clozapine so i don't think i will have a bad paranoid episode now that i have stopped taking it.\n\nI have been thinking about what if i do and have decided to kill myself if i fuck up again. If i fuck up 5 months drugged on Clozapine then ill never be better so what would the point be. I have only attempted once before but botched. sliced my self from left to right later learning it should of been up to down on the vain and it left me in a bloody mess for 5 hours tingling and throbbing. Cant even kill myself right. So i will try and hang myself if it does come to it.\n\nI couldn't talk to anyone the past few days because everyone around me in the real world knows to put me under watch or in a facility if i ever talk about suicide or coming off my pills. And starting from today I'm not going to be physically around anybody for the first 2 weeks to see how my mind copes.\n\nI'm fucking the therapy and the psychiatrists off but have to still see my doctor as it is court ordered. I am going to pretend everything is normal unless my body or mind is hurting then i might have to rethink all of this.\n\nI know what i am doing is morally wrong but Id rather die then spending any more time on that drug. Sorry for the rant, I'm pretty scared at the minute and cannot talk to anyone about this",

        "title": "What Schizophrenia Really Is According to Walsh",
        "text": "Schizophrenia is not one condition. \"Schizophrenia\" is an umbrella classification given to several different disorders, each with different symptoms, root causes, and methods of treatment.\n\nMost psychiatrists are unaware of this, leading them to treat patients by perscribing them different anti-psychotics and tranquilizers in a trial-and-error approach to determine which medication is effective. This is a precarious approach, as it disregards the biochemical individuality of the patient, and risks worsening symptoms by further destabilizing brain chemistry, all in the hopes that the practitioner will stumble upon the right combination of medicines. When abilify doesn't work,  perscribe asenapine, when that doesn't work administer clozapine, or geodon, and when all else fails try risperdal. Each of these medications, while effective, come with their own host of side effects - some worse than the symptoms of the illness itself.\n\nSo, if schizophrenia is *one* disorder, then why is it so difficult to treat? How can it be the case that certain medications work for some people, while others don't? What about cases of sudden remission of the illness?\n\nWilliam Walsh, who in his 30 years of psychiatric research has taken over 50,000 blood tests of people with psychiatric illnesses such as depression, ADHD, bi-polar disorder, and schizophrenia (the largest and most comprehensive of such an archive in the world), claims to have developed a reasonable hypothesis for what schizophrenia is. He claims that there are five biotypes of psychiatric illnesses. These categories were not only based on symptoms, but also on comprehensive blood testing for nutrients and compounds. But before we list the five main biotypes of schizophrenia, let's delve into the most commonly circulated hypothesis, the dopamine theory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The High Dopamine, Low Glutamate Theory**\n\nThe current theory of schizophrenia is the high dopamine theory.  Excessive excitement of the dopamine receptors can cause the emergence of psychotic symptoms. This is the case when drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines, which increase dopamine, are administered in high dosages. This theory was formed upon the discovery that dopamine receptor blockade by antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol reduced psychotic symptoms. It should come as no surprise that high dopamine levels have been observed in the brains of many schizophrenics, further lending credence to this theory.\n\nHowever, PET scans used to examine interactions in the brain revealed that there were some patients who exhibited symptoms of psychosis even with 90% of their D2 receptors blocked by antipsychotic medications. This happened mostly in patients who dealing with the illness for multiple decades. Furthermore, may atypical antipsychotics have a lower affinity for dopamine receptors, yet are effective at treating the negative symptoms of the condition.\n\nNDMA glutamate activity is also associated with psychotic disorders. PCP acts and ketamine both act as glutamate antagonists; when administered at a high dose, they can produce symptoms which are very similar to psychosis. Low glutamate has also been observed in the brains of psychotics.\n\nAdditionally, *serotonin,* which regulates an enormous number of processes in the body is also widely agreed to play a role in schizophrenia. The 5-HT2A receptor is main receptor targeted by psychedelics such as LSD, Psilocybin (Mushrooms), DMT, and mescaline, and is thought to mediate the action of many antipsychotics.\n\nIf it is the case that dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin alone are the cause of this psychiatric condition, re-balancing them should produce a significant reduction in symptoms for all schizophrenics, correct? So why then is it that even after taking multiple SSRI's and dopamine suppressing antipsychotics, sometimes for years, the condition still persists in so many people?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Walsh Theory of Schizophrenia**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thesis 1:  Schizophrenia is Epigenetic in Nature:**\n\nA psychotic breakdown is usually followed by a lifetime of illness and misery.  This often permanent change in functioning results from altered chromatin bookmarks that regulate gene expression.  Since the deviant marks are maintained during future cell divisions, the condition doesn't \u201cgo away\u201d.\n\n**Thesis 2:  Weak Antioxidant Protection is a Distinctive Feature of Schizophrenia:**\n\nMost schizophrenics exhibit a genetic or acquired weakness in antioxidant protection. Evidence from my extensive chemistry database includes generally low levels of glutathione, cysteine, selenium, zinc, polyunsaturated fats, together with high levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper.\n\n**Thesis 3:  Oxidative Overload Produces Deviant Epigenetic Marks in Schizophrenia:**\n\nCancer researchers have identified cumulative oxidative stress as a trigger that can transform healthy cells into cancer cells by altering epigenetic marks that permanently change gene expression. Examples include skin cancer developing after years of excessive sun exposure, and lung cancer following years of cigarette smoking. It\u2019s not a coincidence that nearly all schizophrenia patients exhibit excess oxidative stress.  The onset of schizophrenia occurs when oxidative stresses exceed the threshold level needed to alter chromatin marks that regulate gene expression.\n\n**Thesis 4:  Methylation Imbalances Promote Epigenetic Vulnerability to Oxidative Stress:**\n\nAbnormal methylation of chromatin is a leading cause of epigenetic errors in gene expression.  The combination of oxidative overload and a methyl imbalance can produce gene expression changes that result in a chronic schizophrenia condition.  The two most prevalent forms of schizophrenia develop in persons who exhibit either methyl overload or methyl deficiency.  The two resulting psychotic disorders exhibit very different brain chemistry and symptoms.\n\n**Thesis 5:  Extraordinary Weakness in Antioxidant Protection Can Produce Schizophrenia in the Absence of Methyl Imbalances:**\n\nThe third major schizophrenia phenotype develops in persons with an inborn severe deficit in antioxidant protection.  This condition is arbitrarily termed \u201cPyrrole Disorder\u201d due to the presence of excessive pyrrole levels in blood and urine.  Mental breakdowns occur for these persons during periods of extreme physical or mental stress in which deviant epigenetic marks are established.  This condition is characterized by extraordinary anxiety, rapid mood swings, and often involves both auditory hallucinations and delusional beliefs.  Brain chemistry abnormalities include depressed glutamate activity at NMDA receptors, and very depressed GABA activity.\n\n**Thesis 6:  Failure to Follow Classical Laws of Genetic Inheritance Results From the Epigenetic Nature of Schizophrenia:**\n\nSchizophrenia is strongly heritable (runs in families) but fails to obey Mendel\u2019s classic laws of genetic inheritance.  There are countless examples of identical twins where one sibling develops the disorder and the other does not.  In addition, intensive research efforts to identify the schizophrenia gene (or genes) have met with little success.  Epigenetics provides two explanations for the non-Mendelian nature of schizophrenia: (a) Environmental insults are required to produce deviant epigenetic marks and environmental conditions are highly variable for different individuals, and (b) Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) contributes to schizophrenia heritability by transmitting deviant epigenetic marks to one\u2019s children and grandchildren.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Common Biotypes of Schizophrenia***\n\nThese categories were determined through thousands of blood tests for levels of amino acids, and other compounds critical to neurotransmitter synthesis and cognition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Overmethylation - 46%**\n\nAbout 46% of persons diagnosed with schizophrenia exhibit excessive methylation of chromatin along with weak antioxidant protection. Mental breakdowns generally occur during severe physical or emotional traumatic events that produce overwhelming oxidative stress and deviant gene marks. This schizophrenia biotype is a sensory disorder that generally involves auditory, tactile, or visual hallucinations. This form is of critical importance, as these persons react very poorly to SSRIs. For these patients, taking SSRIs can lead to suicidal or homicide ideation. This condition is associated with elevated activity of dopamine and norepinephrine, and reduced glutamate activity at NMDA receptors.  The most common DSM-5 diagnosis is paranoid schizophrenia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSymptoms & Traits\n\nAuditory hallucinations, paranoia depression, high anxiety and panic attacks, low libido, religiosity, tendency to gain weight, pacing, mood swings/explosive anger, dry eyes, tinnitus, hirsutism, obsessions, frenetic activity, severe intolerance to SSRI antidepressants\n\nEffective medications: atypical antipsychotics such as Risperdal and Geodon.\n\nMedications to be avoided: SSRI Antidepressants\n\nAdditionally, these people may respond well to high doses of niacin or niacinamide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Undermethylation - 28%**\n\nAbout 28% of persons diagnosed with schizophrenia exhibit low methylation of chromatin together with weak antioxidant protection. Mental breakdowns generally occur during severe physical or emotional traumatic events that produce a separate set of altered gene marks.  These people tend to be highly competitive, striving for perfection. Many of these people find that their initial psychotic episode occurred suddenly, during a period of severe stress, such as time in school, or their workplace. Patients such as this often have a calm demeanor, yet high inner tension, they tend to exhibit more of the reasoning distortions such as delusions and paranoia rather than the extreme sensory distortions such as visual and tactile hallucinations. This schizophrenia biotype essentially is a thought disorder with delusions and catatonic tendencies the primary symptoms.  This condition is associated with low activity at serotonin, dopamine, and NMDA receptors.  The most common DSM-5 diagnoses are Schizoaffective Disorder or Delusional Disorder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSymptoms and Traits:\n\nSevere delusions, OCD, catatonic tendencies, phobias, very high libido, high accomplishment prior to onset (perfectionism), denial of illness, low pain tolerance, addictiveness, slenderness, frequent headaches, ritualistic behaviours, rumination about past events, blankminded appearance\n\nEffective medications: antipsychotic SSRIs for depression: Zyprexa, Seroquel, Abilify, Clozaril\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pyrrole Disorder - 27%**\n\nPyroluria, or pyrrole disorder, is a genetically acquired chemical imbalance in which the body produces an abnormally large number of pyrroles. It was first observed during Carl Pfeiffer's urine testing of people suffering from psychotic symptoms. A pyrrole is a chemical consisting of a 5 membered aromatic ring. These chemicals are the byproduct of hemoglobin synthesis and have no known function in the body; they are normally excreted in the urine. Most people have very few pyrroles in their system at any given time; certain individuals, however, have an unusually high number of pyrroles in their bodies, resulting in a condition known as pyroluria. The production of pyrroles/ hydroxyhemopyrrolin can increase with stress, which in turn decreases zinc and B6 \u2013 nutrients that are essential for the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, melatonin, GABA, and acetylcholine. Zinc and B6 fail to be reabsorbed in effective amounts following the onset. Zinc deficiencies have been associated with a number of physiological disorders, including poor immune function, poor growth, and delayed sexual development. Schizophrenic patients suffering from this condition often find that through rebalancing levels of Zinc, B6, and GABA, that they quickly see a reduction in their symptoms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSymptoms:\n\nOnset during severe stress, mixed psychotic symptoms, extreme Anxiety, explosive anger, sensitivity to bright lights and noise, obsessions with negative thoughts, little to no dream recall\n\nEffective medications include all atypical antipsychotics and benzodiazapines (especially Klonapin)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wheat Gluten Intolerance - 4%**\n\nIn some people, there is a poor breakdown of gluten proteins in the G.I. tract, likely due to an intolerant microbiome. Short peptides are formed with opiode-like properties which then travel to the brain and cause inflammation. This condition seems to be the cause of 4% cases of schizophrenia. Upon eliminating wheat, oats, barley, and rye from the diet people suffering from gluten intolerance quickly find that their symptoms have gone into remission.\n\nSymptoms: Mixed psychotic symptoms; worsening of symptoms after the consumption of foods high in gluten\n\nEffective medications include all atypical antipsychotics\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Copper Toxicity - 6%**\n\nCopper is essential to the body. It assists in the production of red blood cells, helps form collagen, absorb iron, and serves a whole host of other functions. It is found in every part of the body - including the brain - where it assists in neuron signaling. It is like a dimmer for neuron communication in the brain.\n\nSo what if a person's body doesn't effectively regulate copper levels, leading to too much copper?\n\nCopper toxicity is marked by extreme levels of copper in the blood and brain, causing a dopamine deficiency and norepinephrine overload. High levels of copper over conduct the brain resulting in sensory excitation and dysregulation. Increased copper retention is necessary to rapidly produce capillaries and blood vessels for the growing fetus, and some mothers are unable to eliminate the excess copper due to estrogen intolerance. Postpartum depression and post partum psychosis is usually caused by copper overload. 17% of the depression patients in the study fit this category. Most patients afflicted with this condition reported little effect from taking SSRIs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSymptoms and traits: Mixed psychotic symptoms with suicidal or homicidal tendencies, more than 95% female with onset during hormonal event, SSRI antipsychotics ineffective\n\nEffective medications: All atypical antipsychotics\n\nMethod of treatment: Rebalancing zinc and copper levels through supplementation and elimination of high copper foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why Niacin can reduce symptoms of Overmethylated Schizophrenia**\n\nNicotinic acid is an organic compound and a form of vitamin B3, a nutrient essential to proper body and brain function.  Niacin and niacinamide both act as dopamine re-uptake promoters and act to remove dopamine from the system. According to the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, high levels fo dopamine cause are are part of the cause of schizophrenia. Dr Abram Hoffer was well known for his experiments with niacin in the treatment of schizophrenia. According to his research, administering high doses (5000mg+) of niacin to overmethylated schizophrenic patients reduced symptoms and cause improvements significantly. You can find various reports around /r/schizophrenia and [schizophrenia.com](https://schizophrenia.com) about people who saw their symptoms improve after supplementing with niacin. If the Walsh hypothesis of schizophrenia is to be believed, these people are likely overmethylated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, now that we've laid out these imbalances, what is the preferred method of testing for, and treating them?**\n\nAccording to Walsh, the main method of correcting these imbalances is advanced nutrient therapy. That is, taking blood tests to screen for the main nutritional imbalances, and then correcting them by supplementing with nutrients and amino acids in a plan tailored to one's unique biochemical makeup. This is critical, as nearly all people suffering from schizophrenia are deficient in several of the key nutrients responsible for cognition. For instance, almost all biotypes displayed a severe deficiency in blood zinc, magnesium, and vitamin D levels - three compounds necessary for the synthesis of various neurotransmitters.\n\nThere are multiple clinics that facilitate this type of testing. Most of them seem to be in the United States, Ireland, and Australia. These labs often test for kryptopyrroles, copper serum, zinc, whole blood Histamine, ceruloplasmin, vitamin D, TSH, CMP14, and homocysteine in order to determine which biotype a person falls into.\n\nAs no two people are unique, no treatment should be either. As such is is not advised that people undertake self diagnosis, as there is a high risk for worsening symptoms if an incorrect determination is made. It is **absolutely** not recommended that people stop taking their prescribed medication and try to do this on their own.\n\nAccording to practitioners specializing in of this method of treating schizophrenia, at least 80% of patients reported that this treatment had a significant impact on their condition, many even reported being able to significantly reduce the dose of their anti-psychotic medication, or eliminate it all together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummarized from the following sources:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_nMcXIoV1VM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nMcXIoV1VM)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bngPW55Po1k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bngPW55Po1k)\n\n[www.mensahmedical.com/images/Schizophrenia-PP\\_1.pdf](https://www.mensahmedical.com/images/Schizophrenia-PP_1.pdf)\n\n[https://archive.org/details/NutrientPowerWilliamJ.WalshPhD](https://archive.org/details/NutrientPowerWilliamJ.WalshPhD)\n\n[https://www.walshinstitute.org/biochemical-individuality--nutrition.html](https://www.walshinstitute.org/biochemical-individuality--nutrition.html)\n\n[http://www.orthomolecularvitamincentre.com/a\\_hoffer\\_schizophrenia.php](http://www.orthomolecularvitamincentre.com/a_hoffer_schizophrenia.php)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2669582/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2669582/)\n\n[https://www.walshinstitute.org/uploads/1/7/9/9/17997321/depression\\_pp\\_2.pdf](https://www.walshinstitute.org/uploads/1/7/9/9/17997321/depression_pp_2.pdf)\n\n[http://www.mensahmedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BiochemicalImbalancesInMentalHealthPopulations.pdf](http://www.mensahmedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BiochemicalImbalancesInMentalHealthPopulations.pdf)\n\n[http://americannutritionassociation.org/sites/default/files/ANA%20Presentation\\_Walsh\\_%2011%2012.pdf](http://americannutritionassociation.org/sites/default/files/ANA%20Presentation_Walsh_%2011%2012.pdf)\n\n[http://www.kumc.edu/Documents/integrativemed/830am\\_DrWalsh\\_%20BD\\_ADHD\\_ASD.pdf.pdf](http://www.kumc.edu/Documents/integrativemed/830am_DrWalsh_%20BD_ADHD_ASD.pdf.pdf)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjXWF7kdvw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjXWF7kdvw)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4083629/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4083629/)\n\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/490850](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/490850)",

        "title": "Dealing with constant voices that bring me to harming myself (maybe TW)",
        "text": "So I've been following this reddit for awhile now just reading what people have to say, especially what's interested me is reading what the voices tell you. I feel quite alone however as I haven't come across anyone with voices like mine, let alone ones that bring anyone to hurt themselves.\n\nBasically I hear 2 streams of voices 24/7. I hear voices telling me to self harm (I cut), and then other voices telling me to kill myself. What they say can range from just saying 1 word over and over like \"cut\" or \"die\" all the way up to full plans like \"you need to buy a blade and cut your forearm x amount of times and it needs to be ~this~ deep\" or \"you should leave the house in the middle of the night, go find a tall building and jump\".\n\nNow when I say I'm being told, it's not really just them suggesting it, they're demanding it. They get louder and louder until it becomes a battle between the streams trying to out shout each other and be \"on top\" (as whichever stream is on top usually dictates my actions). For the majority of the time harm is on top so after days or weeks of being yelled at to slash my arms I finally give in and do it. And guess what, then the voices shut up and give me some peace because I did as I was told.\n\nThe 3 times suicide has been on top I've been in psych facilities and have had nurses find me mid attempt before I was successful, but regardless of if an attempt is successful or not the voices still stop and I get a break. Honestly nothing is as relieving as having some quiet time, my head gets so loud. I'm just so sick of this cycle of voices becoming unbearable > I cave > I harm/attempt > I get short term relief and repeat.\n\nI don't talk back to them as it's futile. There's no negotiating, ignoring or escaping them. I'm 21 and this has been happening since I was 17. I started hearing voices at 15 but they were paranoia based and I only had them when I left the house (so I never did). I've spent nearly all of the last 4 years in various psych facilities, this is all the antipsychotics I've been on and none have been successful:\n\nQuetiapine\nQuetiapine XR\nAsenapine \nOlanzapine \nChlorpromazine \nRisperidone\nZiprasidone\nClozapine \nPaliperidone (tablet)\nPaliperidone (injection)\n\nTL;DR \nVoices tell me to harm and kill myself and the only peace I get from them is if I do what they say. As a result I'm nearly always in psych facilities where they try antipsychotics which have been so far unsuccessful. ",

        "text": "Hello, I've been a lurker for awhile now and thought I'd step out and introduce myself.\n\nI'm 26 and from the UK, I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in January 2016 after being sectioned. Prior to being diagnosed I had had various diagnoses including bipolar, bpd, OCD, recurrent depression and ptsd. I had been in various medication including a couple of antipsychotics. \n\nIt all started when my CPN had suspected for a long time that I was hearing voices, although I was completely unaware of it and asked me outright what I could hear. I said I could hear him and 5 people outside talking about me. There was no one outside. That's how I became acquainted with Olanzapine. But only 2.5mg. That was in September 2015. By December I had taken myself off of my tiny dose of Olanzapine and my 200mg of Lamotrigine. This worried the CMHT. I never keep it a secret when I come off my meds but I will only tell when asked. So yes, I am a bit crafty. By January I was in a proper psychosis and as I mentioned earlier I was sectioned. I was put straight on 15mg of Olanzapine, told I had all the classic symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and that after going through all of my notes the Dr theorised that my prodromal phase started when I was about 17. In his report for the tribunal the Dr was highly critical of the mental health team and suggested that intervention had been missed on numerous occasions. I was discharged by tribunal after 2 weeks.\n\nOlanzapine was great for my positive symptoms but it made me very anxious, restless and fat. So I switched to Amisulpride (omfg it was awful). I was hospitalised again in June 2016 and put on Aripiprazole (amazing) but cleverly decided I didn't need it and was promptly sectioned again in September 2016. I was recommenced on Aripiprazole (maintena) and my section 3 was converted to a community treatment order. In February 2017 I was recalled to hospital because the Aripiprazole wasn't working I was there for 2 months this time and put on Clozapine. I stayed mentally well for awhile but physically was a wreck. A very helpful GP (not mine) told me to stop taking Clozapine. I knew I shouldn't of but felt so awful it gave me a good excuse to stop it. What ensued was hell but I managed to avoid hospital by going on Flupentixol depot. Up until recently I've just bumbled along but became ill again. How I wasn't sectioned again I'll never know, there was talk of it. Was coaxed into taking 10mg of Haloperidol by my psychiatrist and have bounced back surprisingly well for someone who has been labelled as treatment resistant. My depot has now been changed to Haldol and I'm starting to feel much better. \n\nSorry for such a long post. It looks like I've got the verbal shits. Anyway I take a cocktail of Haloperidol, Chlorpromazine, Vortioxetine and Clonazepam for my mental health. Oh and I'm female. \n\nTl;dr 26. F. Paranoid Schizophrenia. Various sections. Various meds. Taking Haloperidol. Feeling a bit better now.",

I'm sure the result would be similar for other antipsychotics, and maybe even work to combat such symptoms from SSRIs / SNRIs. I'd suggest talking with your doctor, and giving it a shot. Sure, trying other medicine could be an option, but for those of us that don't have many options, this could help a lot.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nI don't trust doctors much at all. Being frank with you, I think letting your doctor decide what medicine you should be on, is foolish. You know yourself better than anyone, after all. I personally refuse to attend any type of therapy, either. I've lived my entire life only depending on myself, only trusting myself. I'm a very intelligent and philosophical person, and I take the time to figure things out for myself, work things out for myself. I'm sure other people could benefit from therapy, but I'll share with you my technique. By the way, when doing research on medicine, try checking them out on RxList for dosage guidelines. It's a nice website to use. \n\n**Step One \\~ Reflection:**\n\nTo be quite frank with you, I don't care much about diagnoses. You know what you deal with on a daily basis better than anyone. If you can't put a label to certain feelings, or why certain things are happening, do some research. Do you have psychosis in the absence of mood episodes? Is it only during an episode? Be reflective; look at the past, look at the present, figure out why things are happening, under what circumstances they're happening. Maybe keep a journal? When you're feeling some type of way, try to write what brought it on, try to write about the circumstances at the time. Were you really tired at the time? If you were, did it exacerbate the symptoms significantly? Are these symptoms happening for a long period of time under normal circumstances? Just be reflective in general. I consider this part to be the most important part. Taking time to deeply reflect, journal things as they're happening, or after they've happened. Once you get to the root of your problems, you can go from there. If it's a persistent problem significantly effecting your life, you'll probably need medicine. Besides that, YOU have to put in a lot of work, too. It's not just the medicine's responsibility to fix all your problems. \n\nWant my advice? Go with the flow, live in the moment, and do you naturally. Don't dwell on shit, just LIVE. You are RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW. The past has gone and the future is yet to come. All you can do is choose what to do with the current moment. Literally everything is a choice, if you think about it. You are the only one responsible for your destiny. You are the only one responsible for controlling your actions and reactions in life. If you're going through a hard time, you CAN control your reaction to it. Sure, you might feel bad, but dwelling on it and refusing to move on, isn't going to help. So, go with the flow, live in the moment, and do you. Regardless of what type of person you are, or what you believe in, just do you. It doesn't matter if society disagrees with your way of life, what you are, or what you do; fuck them. It's your life, and only your life. So, be who you are naturally, and don't hold back. Why be afraid of people judging you? Sure, they might judge you, but FIGHT BACK. Why be so focused on trying to please others? Please yourself and take care of yourself FIRST. Do you FOR you. I'll give you an example: I really like to be barefoot. If someone sees me barefoot and they think, \"Wow. That guy is weird, that guy is gross.\", good for them. They have the right to their sheep minded opinions. If they'd try to call me out on it though, I'd say, \"Wow. I think it's pretty self\\-centered of you to think I give a fuck about your opinion. I don't even know you, and you expect me to live a way you approve of?\" \\~ If they'd ask me why I'm barefoot, I'd say \"Why are you wearing shoes?\". Dumbfuck questions get dumbfuck answers. I'm barefoot obviously because I decided not to put shoes on. You get my train of thought? You just gotta do you and LIVE. Your personal happiness is your right; don't let anyone take that away from you.\n\n**Step Two \\~ Medication:**\n\nAt this point, you should have taken time to reflect, research, and find the root of your problems. Honestly, diagnoses are kind of irrelevant in my personal opinion. What I consider to be the best treatment, is a symptom focused approach. Get to the root of the problem, get medicated if you need medication, and continue to go with the flow and use every moment to grow stronger; use every moment as a learning opportunity. Knowledge is good, but putting knowledge into action, is wisdom. Think of your plans and research for medicine as a constantly changing rough draft. If it doesn't work, go back to the drawing board and come up with a plan B. Are you on a SSRI but still not having the results you want? Consider upping the dose, changing the medicine, or augmenting it with a different medication. \n\nI deal with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, ADHD \\- Combined Type, and Persistent Depressive Disorder, that much is 100&#37; for sure. On top of that, I either have Schizoaffective Disorder \\- Depressive Type, or Schizotypal Personality Disorder. Honestly, I have so many fucking problems, it's really hard to put a finger on what exactly my diagnoses should be. So, I just take a symptom based approach rather than trying to figure the differences out. Too much overlap. \n\nI recently went to a psychiatrist a couple months ago for basically the first time in my life \\(besides when I was tested for ADHD as a kid\\). I always refused medication and help, but yeah... I need it now, lol. Right now I'm on Venlafaxine and Atomoxetine. Previously, I was on Guanfacine, Buspirone, Hydroxyzine, Atomoxetine, and Lamotrigine. There's so many interactions between all that shit, it's literally ridiculous. Not to mention, I literally had no reason to be on Lamotrigine. I don't have bipolar disorder, I have ADHD!!! The Buspirone did absolutely nothing, the Hydroxyzine was interacting with pretty much everything and making me feel like shit. I had no reason to be on Guanfacine and Atomoxetine at the same time, I mean seriously, holy shit lol. Ever since that first meeting, I've been going to him and telling him what I want and why I want / need it, and basically just being my own psychiatrist. It's working out pretty good, lol. Like I said, you know yourself better than anyone! Don't put up with bullshit, do it yourself! Some of these doctors are literally just fucking quacks. You really have to take them with a grain of salt, and do research on your own part. That's where taking into account the risk / reward ratio of the medicine you're taking comes into play.\n\nSo, my cocktail is going to be:  Venlafaxine 150mg, Atomoxetine 80mg, and Olanzapine 10mg after my next meet \\~\\~ If the Olanzapine starts giving me too much trouble, I'm going to look for a good alternative. If I decide the risk / reward is worth it though, I'll keep the Olanzapine and add Topiramate 100mg \\(depending on how the Olanzapine effects me\\). \\~\\~ Before you even get into choosing a SSRI / SNRI, antipsychotics, ADHD medicine, or anything of the like, you need to focus on one thing: **Risk / Reward**. You need to choose what you take wisely; aim for the most effective medicine possible, that treats as many problems of yours as possible, with as little interactions as possible, and as little side effects as possible. Medicines can interact in a positive way, as well. For example, some antipsychotics are better than others in dealing with negative symptoms. Therefore instead of increasing your SSRI to a crazy level and risking more side effects, or adding another SSRI and adding more interactions, consider perhaps another antipsychotic that's better at dealing with the negative symptoms than the one you're on. Or upping your antipsychotic dose if it's a low dose? Remember, you have soooo many options with all the medicine out there nowadays. Just be smart and focus on Risk / Reward, consider all alternatives!\n\nAnyways, I'm going to give you the process I used to figure out the drug cocktail I'm going to get on soon. I don't know if this will help anyone, but I hope it does. \n\nDo you have ADHD like me, but also need to be on an antipsychotic? That means you can't take stimulants because of interactions. Which means you'd have to take the Atomoxetine \\+ Antipsychotic combo. The Atomoxetine could take care of the inattentive side of things, the antipsychotic would undoubtedly take care of the hyperactivity side of things. Anyways, knowing that, Atomoxetine is the #1 medicine on my list, as it's a pill I really need. So, I'm going to build around that pill and choose the SSRI / SNRI & antipsychotic combos that have as few interactions and side effects as possible, balancing that risk / reward.\n\nI checked out the SSRIs and SNRIs on that list and googled all of them, checking what symptoms they treat. After picking through it, I wound up with 5 or 6 that would treat treat the Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Depression. Then, I took each pill and ran it through the [drugs.com](https://drugs.com) interaction checker, and was left only with Venlafaxine. Why? All those other pills had MAJOR interactions with the Atomoxetine. Like I said, just try to focus on balancing out the risk / reward. I'm very satisfied with my choice of Venlafaxine; it's 78&#37; more effective than placebo as stated earlier, so the numbers look good too, which is always nice.\n\nSo. I'm currently taking Atomoxetine and Venlafaxine. I've seen some improvement on my inattentive symptoms, but I'd like more. I'm going to wait on bumping the Atomoxetine up to 100mg until I get the other medicine straight, though. See, another thing to consider with medicine, is how they'll do working together. Both the Venlafaxine and Olanzapine will have effects on my ADHD. Therefore, I'm going to see how those two effect my ADHD before upping my Atomoxetine dose \\(once again, risk / reward\\). I've had persistent and debilitating depression ever since I was like, 4 or 5 years old. The 75mg of Venlafaxine isn't cutting it. I've noticed that it is helping a bit, but once again, I need more. This is what I was talking about when referencing a \"constantly changing rough draft\". You just have to take it one step at a time, and think smart. Knowing where I'm at right now, my plans are to increase my dose of Venlafaxine to 150mg. This should help with the ADHD, help with the depression, and ease the anxiety even more. Okay. So, at this point I've got a solid plan. Atomoxetine 80mg, Venlafaxine 150mg. Now, I need to add an antipsychotic to the list. Going through the list of antipsychotics, it's really sad how little efficiency most have vs placebo. Currently with the Atomoxetine & Venlafaxine combo, I've got the choice between Luraisdone and Olanzapine. All the other ones have very bad interactions with Atomoxetine & Venlafaxine. Anyways, the Olanzapine should work really good with the Venlafaxine to basically kill the depression and anxiety. I hope so anyways, I'm kind of hesitant to up Venlafaxine all the way up to 225. Considering at that dose Venlafaxine starts effecting dopamine, I don't think it'd be a good idea \\(antipsychotic interaction\\). But yeah, guys. Check [drugs.com](https://drugs.com) interaction checker for all your medicine. Google it too. Ie Venlafaxine and Olanzapine. Check which receptors drugs effect, see if there's conflicts the interaction checker missed. See if there's opposing mechanisms. Just, do research. It's better safe than sorry. Remember, you need to balance out risk / reward as much as you can. \n\nThe plan is simply to be on Atomoxetine, Venlafaxine, and Olanzapine. If the negative side effects of Olanzapine become too much though, I've got multiple options. I could add the Topiramate, or switch to the Lurasidone. The third route is switching to a less effective SSRI / SNRI. I could also always use two SSRIs if needed. And if I change SSRI, that means I possibly have more antipsychotic alternatives. If it really came down to it, I could just cut out the Atomoxetine and then having way more freedom of choice. This just goes to show you, you always have options. Just take it one step at a time, do lots of research, and balance risk / reward. You'll find the perfect combo for you :\\)\n\nI know this was a REALLLLLYYYY drawn out post, but I hope it helps you guys. Remember, think for yourself and take control of your own life, YOU CAN DO THIS!",

I sometimes 'see' this demon - this is the hardest one to explain to people... Sometimes I see the demon in my head, like it wants only me to see it, and other times I see a shadowy figure lurking... Sometimes the demon is also random strangers. \n\n* Paranoia to the extreme. If people are talking away from me, then I think they're talking about me/plotting to get rid of the dog. Sometimes people have poisoned my food. Sometimes my girlfriend is only with me for her own amusement. Sometimes there's someone falling me. Every time I get meds they're placebos, but I need to take them so that they don't realise I know because it's probably one big test to make sure I'm not faking it at all. \n\n* Noise. I can't distinguish between noise sources if there is too many. It ends up overwhelming me and I can't distinguish what is in my head and what isn't. Speaking of what's in my head, I don't even know how to explain it... It's like there's multiple voices all commenting on my life, they come and go and typically are abusive... but they sound like my voice but they don't like my voice, I don't believe that they're me. \n\n* I get so overwhelmed I start hitting myself, pulling my hair, scratching myself... Last night I scratched so hard that it now hurts to move the hand I was scratching. \n\n* I can't remember the last time I had a shower or a bath but if I wash too often then my skin dries out. The days just blend together and I have no idea what's going on. \n\nI've been off work for the last 4 weeks and 4 days, and I'm due to go back tomorrow but honestly I feel like I'm in the middle of some weird psychedelic high type thing - I don't even know how to describe it. \n\nI haven't been officially diagnosed (it's been tossed around by a few professionals and there seems to be a family connection of mental health disorders). I've just started the mental health team (I'm in the UK) and I've only seen a nurse and they've put in referral off to psychiatry. My GP has prescribed Trazodone - for the first month it was only 50mg, but in the last week it's been upped to 150mg - and chlorpromazine 25mg for the last 2 weeks. \n\nI go back to work tomorrow and I honestly don't know how I'm going to function - I work in a call centre. I'm no closer to any answers as I was at the start of all this and the trazodone and chlorpromazine aren't helping me sleep - they just make me tired when I wake up and throughout the day... I don't even know if I'll be able to wake up in time to go to work.\n\nIt's honestly all just a mess and I don't know what I'm even looking for by posting here... ",

        "text": "Hi everyone.\n\nI (F/30s) was initially diagnosed and put on anti-psychotics between the ages 17 to 29. I had been prescribed everything from Haloperidol (Haldol), Lurasidone (Latuda), Risperidone (Risperidol), Clozapine, Aripiprazole (Abilify), Ziprasidone (Geodon), Chlorpromazine (Thorazine), and probably others I cannot remember. Several of these were short-term to see their efficacy while others I took for longer. Geodon was the medication I was on the longest.\n\nOver the past several years I have had serious problems with my teeth. Tooth care has never been an issue for me - I take good care of them. However, it seems the integrity of my teeth are horrendous. I have had several root canals, pulled teeth (followed by having implants and crowns put in), cavities, and now I have a tooth that is basically crumbling out of my mouth. I cannot come up with any reason for having such poor teeth to anything but having taken the above medications for a long time. My family have run-of-the-mill dental issues but nothing like what I have, so I have all but ruled out genetics. This issue is causing me real anguish and serious depressed states because I feel like there is nothing I can do, no matter how well I take care of my teeth.\n\nDoes anyone else have any similar problem? Especially those who have taken medication for prolonged periods of time? If anyone does have a similar issue are you managing it somehow?\n\nThanks :)",

        "title": "Evolution of and History Excerpts of Schizophrenia",
        "text": "I've recently come to the theory that schizophrenia has been with mankind throughout history. I am pasting some excerpts by an MD who wrote an article on the subject...\n\n\"In antiquity, people did not think of \u2018madness\u2019 (a term that they used indiscriminately for all forms of psychosis) in terms of mental illness, but in terms of divine punishment or demonic possession. Evidence for this comes from the Old Testament and most notably from the First Book of Samuel, according to which King Saul became \u2018mad\u2019 after neglecting his religious duties and angering God. The fact that David used to play on his harp to make Saul better suggests that, even in antiquity, people believed that psychotic illnesses could be successfully treated.\n\nBut the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him \u2026 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him. \u20141 Samuel 16.14, 16.23 (KJV)\n(cont)\n\nIt is perhaps worth noting that not everybody in antiquity invariably thought of \u2018madness\u2019 as a curse or an illness. In Plato\u2019s Phaedrus, the Greek philosopher Socrates (470-399 BC) says,\n\nMadness, provided it comes as the gift of heaven, is the channel by which we receive the greatest blessings \u2026 the men of old who gave things their names saw no disgrace or reproach in madness; otherwise they would not have connected it with the name of the noblest of arts, the art of discerning the future, and called it the manic art \u2026 So, according to the evidence provided by our ancestors, madness is a nobler thing than sober sense \u2026 madness comes from God, whereas sober sense is merely human.\"\n\n(cont)\n\nIn the Middle Ages, religion became central to cure and, alongside the mediaeval asylums such as the Bethlehem in London, some monasteries transformed themselves into centres for the treatment of mental illness. This is not to say that the humoral theories of Hippocrates had been forgotten, but merely that they had been incorporated into the prevailing Christian beliefs, and the purgatives and blood-lettings continued alongside the prayers and confession.\n\n(cont)\n\nEmpirical thinkers such as John Locke (1632-1704) in England and Denis Diderot (1713-1784) in France challenged this status quo by arguing, very much as Cicero had done, that reason and emotions are caused by nothing more or less than sensations. Also in France, the physician Philippe Pinel (1745-1826) began regarding mental illness as the result of exposure to psychological and social stressors. A landmark in the history of psychiatry, Pinel\u2019s Medico-Philosophical Treatise on Mental Alienation or Mania called for a more humane approach to the treatment of mental illness. This so-called \u2018moral treatment\u2019 included respect for the person, a trusting and confiding doctor-patient relationship, decreased stimuli, routine activity, and the abandonment of old-fashioned Hippocratic treatments. At about the same time as Pinel in France, the Tukes (father and son) in England founded the York Retreat, the first institution \u2018for the humane care of the insane\u2019 in the British Isles.\n\n(cont)\n\nFebrile illnesses such as malaria had been observed to temper psychotic symptoms, and in the early twentieth century \u2018fever therapy\u2019 became a common form of treatment for schizophrenia. Psychiatrists tried to induce fevers in their patients, sometimes by means of injections of sulphur or oil. Other popular but unsatisfactory treatments included sleep therapy, gas therapy, electroconvulsive or electroshock treatment, and prefrontal leucotomy\u2014the removal of the part of the brain that processes emotions. Sadly, many such \u2018treatments\u2019 were aimed more at controlling disturbed behaviour than at curing illness or alleviating suffering. In some countries, such as Germany during the Nazi era, the belief that schizophrenia resulted from a \u2018hereditary defect\u2019 even led to atrocious acts of forced sterilization and genocide. The first antipsychotic drug, chlorpromazine, first became available in the 1950s, and opened up an era of hope and promise for schizophrenia sufferers and their carers. Since the advent of antipsychotic drugs, the use of electroconvulsive therapy in schizophrenia has become increasingly rare. Nevertheless, it should be underlined that modern electroconvulsive therapy is a safe and humane intervention, and that it can be highly effective in the treatment of severe mood symptoms that have not responded to medication.\n\n(cont)\n\nToday, schizophrenia sufferers stand a better chance than at any other time in history of leading a normal life. And thanks to the fast pace of on-going medical research, a good outcome is increasingly likely.\n\nEND\n\nPlease note: Dr. Neal Burton wanted to make the distinction of 'schizophrenic to schizophrenia sufferer' in an attempt to not limit the sufferer to simply the disease itself.\n\n\n\nHow does this make you feel? This makes me feel that we are way better off than we were in antiquity but we still have ways to go. I have often times thought that the system in which we live in is still far than efficient in treating the illness. It seems almost that some parts in history, when the disease was considered more spiritual as it is still considered in some eastern countries prognosis, stigma, and treatment were/are better. I still find it fascinating. But that is my interpretation.\n\n\nWhat are yours? Any comments?\n\nHere is a link to the full article: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201209/brief-history-schizophrenia\n\n",

        "comment": "I've seen 400mg used for a 10 year old. Those were extenuating circumstances- he had *intense* homicidal rage, and Thorazine was the only thing that kept him from attacking people. He had attempted to murder other children before that, so it made a very compelling argument for \"the ends justify the means.\"\n\nI've only ever seen Thorazine used for children who had shown an inclination to violence in the past. If this is the case for you, I would *strongly* urge you to consider that any dose of Thorazine is the lesser of two evils. \n\nThe alternative is incarceration, because if those violent urges are not addressed and kept at bay, you will eventually act on them, hurt someone, and be put into the system. Once you're in the system for that, your fate is effectively sealed. You will not go on to succeed in life. You will be a product of the system, a tragic cautionary tale. You don't want that. Thorazine gives you a chance to live a somewhat normal life.\n\nTry it. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. Tell your doctor, and *be honest with them.* There are high stakes here, and the worst thing you can do is lie.",

        "comment": "Yeah, I'm not surprised. That's about the only reason they use Thorazine for kids nowadays.\n\n100mg isn't an unreasonable dose. Thorazine was the first antipsychotic, has been in use for several decades now. There's a ton of evidence on its use, what is and is not appropriate, and it created the roadmap for the rest of antipsychotics. The original use for Thorazine *was* as a chemical restraint to prevent violence, the antipsychotic action was actually a \"side effect.\" Fun history lesson there.\n\nBefore Thorazine, there was no hope for people like you- or even me. The alternative was a lobotomy, which was taking an icepick to your frontal lobe through your eyesocket and driven in with a hammer, then violently jerked to amputate the frontal lobe- and people were willing to do that, willing to allow the institutions to do it to other people, because they perceived it to be a situation of \"the ends justify the means.\"\n\nYou have to do *everything* in your power to fight those thoughts. Consider Thorazine a weapon- and a powerful one- in that fight. If it is not working well enough, tell your doctor you need more. The price of failure is astronomical, the stakes could not be higher.\n\nYou seem like a good kid, though. I went bonkers around your age, and I wish I had the presence of mind that you do when I was fifteen. So long as you stay with it, keep walking the good path and doing the right thing, you've got a good future ahead of you.\n\nTake care of yourself.",

Additionally, my mom refuses to take any medications. She is afraid of leaving the house, to the extent that she won't even go to the back yard anymore. She believes that she will disappear or evaporate if she goes outside. We cannot physically force her due to her age and physical condition.\n\nOur family doctor did recommend mixing a small amount of chlorpromazine with her food. My concern is that the medication might have adverse effects and potentially harm her. Additionally, there is a possibility that she may discover the medication in her food and refuse to consume anything we offer her.",

        "text": "His name is Joe. There was another version of this video where a short comment was given by no other than dr. Heinz Lehmann [1], who is also doing the interview with Joe. He said that  Joe exhibits several major symptoms of hebephrenic schizophrenia: untidy appearance, disorganized thinking and behaviour, gross attention deficit, mannerisms, complete confusion in time and space, etc. In two words, a textbook case. Dr. Lehmann also said that he arrived to the ward in catatonic stupor 12 years ago (shown to Joe on a photograph), and he progressed towards hebephrenic type which is not uncommon over the course of years. He said nothing about therapy, but I vaguely remember the interview was said to have been made somewhere around 1950. That's just before chlorpromazine was introduced.\nDr Lehmann has remarked that this is not the way a psychiatrist should do an examination interview, it was guided in a way to clearly show the major symptoms.\nAnyhow, here's the video:\nhttps://youtu.be/wXmJJbia2o4\n\nI'm no psychiatrist (though I regularly see one) but I find this video fascinating. Joe must have suffered, I wonder if chlorpromazine helped him.\n\nIf you're bored here's a riddle: both my user name and password are something that Joe said. Good luck! :)\n\n\n[1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Lehmann?wprov=sfla1",

Chlorpromazine (Thorazine) is all right for schizophrenia and manic episodes though not my first choice unless sedation is a primary goal of the medication treatment. It's also not seen as a primary treatment for catatonia; that is best managed by benzodiazepines (formerly barbiturates) or ECT, though sometimes an antipsychotic is added on to help if there is an underlying psychotic disorder contributing.",

        "text": "I've been diagnosed with severe depression and living on meds for over a year now. After having been in the hospital for four pretty long stays (up to four and a half months) and having had sertraline, abilify, cyamemazine and chlorpromazine, I'm now on venlafaxine (300 mg), mirtazapine (30 mg), quetiapine (300 mg) and levomepromazine (depends on my anxiety but up to five times 15 mg). I have a really hard time figuring out how I feel regarding my treatment. I know this doesn't necessarily say much but is it a \"heavy\" treatment? I mean, heavier than average. I just feel like a lost cause because despite all the different med changes i've had I still don't feel good (tho better than it has been). I don't have too many side effects but sometimes I feel like meds are kind of changing who I am, in the sense that they dull my emotions (I guess it's better than feeling desperate all the time) and I wonder how they are messing up my brain mechanisms and if I stop someday I will ever go back to normal. I'm constantly switching between knowing I need my meds and feeling like I should just stop taking them because they're useless, not to say counterproductive. The only time I mentioned it to my psychiatrist she became defensive and just asked if I was against meds in general. I am absolutely not and I know they are helpful for some people but it feels that for me they're just not. So I wondered if any of you guys ever experienced the same kind of thoughts and how you dealt with it. I know it shouldn't but my relation to my meds has become something I spiral about, I feel like I'm becoming crazy because I don't recognize who I thought I was, like I'm not supposed to question meds, I'm not supposed to think meds are changing my personality, that kind of things.

        "text": "**TL;DR:** Decreased dopamine system activity, induced by both SSRIs and typical antipsychotics, can cause hypothyroidism and sexual dysfunction (hyperprolactinemia, low testosterone, high estrogen) in both rats and humans. Taurine and CoQ-10, which have antioxidant properties, significantly attenuate hormonal and sexual dysfunction induced by Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a dopamine D2 receptor typical antipsychotic, in rats - and even reverse previously established damage. They might also help with SSRI-related sexual dysfunction since it may also involve dopaminergic dysfunction.\n\n****\n\nSSRIs are well known to induce sexual dysfunction through serotonin-induced decreases in dopamine neuron firing. This sexual dysfunction may persist beyond cessation in an unknown percentage of users.\n\nTypical antipsychotic drugs, which block the dopamine D2 receptor, are known to induce sexual dysfunction as well - usually even more severely than SSRIs. They are notorious for decreasing testosterone levels in men, increasing prolactin levels in both sexes, and decreasing thyroid activity in both sexes. This is due to dopamine's crucial role in the functioning of these hormonal systems.\n\nWhile SSRIs are not antipsychotics, what antipsychotics and SSRIs have in common is the decrease in dopamine system function they each cause - SSRIs indirectly by decreasing dopamine release, and typical antipsychotics by blocking the dopamine D2 receptor.\n\n****\n\nAccording to a 2021 study done in rats^[[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33146779/) , the combination of the antioxidants Taurine and CoQ-10 can powerfully prevent and even reverse established hormonal and sexual dysfunction induced by Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a typical antipsychotic. This is reflected by the normalization of motor behavior, which is impaired by CPZ. While CPZ alone decreased dopamine, testosterone levels and decreased thyroid activity - the combination of CPZ with Taurine + CoQ-10 resulted in almost complete prevention of these effects. In addition, CPZ increased estrogen levels, which was also attenuated by Taurine + CoQ-10 co-treatment.  More remarkably, Taurine + CoQ-10 partially but significantly reversed previously established hormonal/sexual dysfunction induced by CPZ.\n\nIn yet another study from 2021^[[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33548410/) , Taurine + CoQ-10 reversed testicular dysfunction induced by CPZ. Decreased dopamine signaling by CPZ leads to testicular dysfunction through derangement of sexual hormones - decreased testosterone, increased estrogen, and decreased FSH and LH were caused by CPZ, and all were attenuated by Taurine + CoQ-10 treatment.\n\n****\n\nHopefully this will be studied in humans soon. Taurine and CoQ-10 are both safe supplements, and it seems like in the meanwhile there's not much harm in trying the combination.",

I\u2019m after some advice/experiences from peers with a similar knowledge base to me. \n\nI\u2019m 35/f/uk and have been on medication since I was fifteen, so twenty years now. I\u2019ve been diagnosed for about ten years with PTSD, Borderline, Avoidant and Dependent PDs, chronic dysthymia (depression) and I also have quite high anxiety at times, but it\u2019s more linked to trauma response. Sorry for the essay \ud83d\ude44 I\u2019m in recovery but the pandemic has caused a couple of significant breakdowns.\n\nThis is what I\u2019ve tried so far:\nFluoxetine\nCitalopram\nEscitalopram\nRisperidone\nQuetiapine\nVenlafaxine\nChlorpromazine\nOlanzipine\nLamotrigine\nMirtazapine\nSertraline\nDuloxetine\n\nNow around the time I started taking sertraline I also had life-changing therapy (ACT) and my recovery was going really well. I had two children and the stress of that meant I maxed out on that and my psychiatrist changed me onto duloxetine. I\u2019ve been taking it for around three years now, but I\u2019m not a great fan of it. I\u2019m currently taking 120mg daily, which I think is the max dose again. I most recently increased the dose in spring 2020, so around eighteen months ago.\n\nSince I started taking it, I\u2019ve experienced withdrawal symptoms and brain zaps even when I know I\u2019ve taken them on time. I know the half life is shorter than sertraline and it\u2019s more closely related to venlafaxine, but even on 300mg venlafaxine I never had this pseudo-withdrawal. \n\nI feel that this side effect is bad enough that I would like to change medications, but I don\u2019t know what else is out there. If I were to go back on sertraline, would I be put on the max dose? If so, where would my safety net be? Sertraline just stopped working for me, so is it even an option?\n\nI would rather steer away from these venlafaxine-related ones because of the side effects. \n\nI\u2019m not currently under a psychiatrist or CMHRS but anticipate needing to make contact with them via my GP. I\u2019m just after peer support at the moment. \n\nThanks so much if you read all that!!",

        "comment": "Mirtazapine is an easy one to get from a GP, but it's known for weight gain / food cravings which not everyone likes. Also gives you tiredness when you start it. \n\nVortioxetine may well be available for you. Possibly a GP could prescribe that but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nMoclobemide (reversible MAOI) is available but local rules very likely need the recommendation of a psychiatrist before a GP can prescribe. It's normally well tolerated. Doesn't tend to cause sexual dysfunction. However some people complain that it just doesn't do anything at all.\n\nBupropion is occasionally used for treatment resistant depression, but it's off label prescribing in the UK, so it would come down to the luck of whether your local psychiatrist was willing to recommend it or not.\n\nTricyclics are available and possibly a GP would write a prescription. Other than Lofepramine, they are dangerous in overdose, so doctors sometimes worry about that issue.\n\nThen you have irreversible MAOIs like Phenelzine or Tranylcypromine, which unfortunately are a bitch to get prescribed here.",

He had seen what he thought was inflammation in the back of my eye, but when the eye specialist dilated my eyes and looked into them, she saw no inflammation and told me I had the best eyes she'd seen all day. I have been noticing that I'm very sensitive to light ever since I moved to AZ. I'm not sure if it was this bad before (I usually shrugged any pain off thinking that I was overreacting, I've recently been trying to not ignore the pain I've been feeling), but when I go outside it can be a level 4-6 pain initially, and then it fades into like a 1-3 depending on how bright it is. When I went home from the eye specialist (note, they didn't give me any kind of sunglasses or eye protection) and I went outside, the light was overwhelming but not painful.\n\nToday, my eyes have gone back to normal, and the pain is back. In the office building where I work, my eyes have been in a constant level 2 pain, which isn't a lot of pain but it's been incredibly annoying. When I went outside this morning, I tried to feel exactly where the pain was in my eyes, and I'm pretty sure it comes from the contraction the eye makes when it tries to adjust to the light. I should also note that I mentioned my light sensitivity to the specialist and she told me she has no idea what's causing it. She was in a rush, and that wasn't the primary reason I was there, so idk if she brushed it off because of that. Is there a way to stop the pain? Do I need to take eye drops? Should I see another specialist?",

GP changed my contraceptive pill to one that does not contribute to high blood pressure (Cerelle) thinking that was the problem. It was not. I was referred to a cardiologist to do a 24hr blood pressure monitor in which the results came back positive for diastolic hypertension. They wish to do further investigation for the cause of the hypertension as I\u2019m told it\u2019s extremely unusual for someone my age and weight to have high blood pressure. I\u2019m extremely worried. Doctor has not put me on blood pressure medication due to extra investigation needed and it\u2019s freaking me out. My father had a heart attack age 30, I don\u2019t know the reasons for this but that seems incredibly young to me. My mother has diabetes and got diagnosed with high blood pressure in her 40s. I don\u2019t know what to do or if I should ask my doctor to put me on medication. Every time I get chest pains I think it\u2019s my time. I have a lot of health anxiety as it is since I have so many health problems so it just feels like one thing after another. Is there anything I can do or ask to ease this or reverse it? \n\nSome extra notes: I quit smoking as soon as I found out. I don\u2019t drink alcohol or take drugs. I have a sedentary lifestyle due to having patella baja in knees. I\u2019m a university student. Other medications I take regularly (UK names): co-codamol 30/500, Lofepramine, Chlorpromazine, Cerelle. \n\nEDIT TO ADD:\nBlood tests have come back fine for years. Had a chest xray recently and heart etc. look fine according to radiologist. I get frequent pain under left breast which I assume is pleurisy. My average blood pressure readings from a few months ago (I haven\u2019t measured it myself recently) was around 137/92. My average resting heart rate is 80BPM. When walking outside it can shoot up to 170+ BPM. Sometimes my Apple Watch says it\u2019s as low as 54 BPM, but I understand these readings can be inaccurate if you\u2019re heavily tattooed like my arms are. ",

They were constant, every few seconds. At times he would hiccup so much within a short time he was unable to breathe. Since then, he has started to take baclofen and chlorpomazine together and it helps. However, he will still get his hiccups back for 2-3 days non stop at times and we\u2019re not sure why. He\u2019s still on the medicine now and currently has non-stop hiccups again. None of his doctors know why. We are awaiting a neurologist appointment but would really like some help/ answers as to why this is happening and how to manage it. \n\nThe pattern seems to be related to when and what he\u2019s eating but the GI doctor and hernia surgeon kept insisting it\u2019s not related to any of his GI problems and are sending us to other specialists.

I have been hearing far away conversations (think mumbled voices, far away laughing, and whispering) that I'm not sure are real - sometimes I think it could reasonably be my neighbours and sometimes it happens when I'm driving in my car alone, so I am 99% convinced it's not real. I believe I have lumps in my breasts but they're always changing and moving and I can never find them to show my partner, I am not 100% certain they are real, and think I may be having some health related paranoia also.\n\n\nI'm concerned by the increasing frequency and intensity of these symptoms and want to know if this is \"normal\" post concussion brain activity or if it may be psychosis?\n\nMy BPD has been well controlled with my current meds for the past 2-3 yrs, but I know psychosis is possible and common.\n\n\nI have a GP appt in a few days but would like to know if I should think about seeing a psych v neurologist or both?

It was started at sunday night, September 25th. As usual, I slept the whole day during sunday. I felt normal until I was about to sleep at the middle of the night. I suddenly couldn't sleep. I kept trying but it only increased my anxiety.  So, I spent sunday night sleepless\nMonday September 26th I go to the psychiatrist. She told me that I have Generalized anxiety disorder and she gave me clobazam and fluoxetine. However, they didn't work well. Then, I go to an  internist doctor. He gave me a cocktail that consists of 4 or 5 medicines. It helped me sleep for about a month. However, my wife suggested me to go to the psychiatrist instead depending on the cocktail from an internist doctor. So, I went to the psychiatrist. He gave me cocktail consists of aripiprazole, hexymer, lorazepam and chlorpromazine. It worked wonderfully for about 2-3 months. Then something strange happened. When I was napping, I felt a searing headache that made me woke up from my nap. After that headache, I couldnt take a nap until now. I asked my psychiatrist but he didnt know what caused my headache and inability to take a nap. He just gave me the same cocktail. I could sleep fairly well at night but I couldnt take a nap, which made me frustrated because I love napping. Besides that, the medicine started to give me adverse effects like blurry vision, tremor, etc. What must I do? Should I change to another psychiatrist? What is your suggestion?",

However, my wife suggested me to go to the psychiatrist instead depending on the cocktail from an internist doctor. So, I went to the psychiatrist. He gave me cocktail consists of aripiprazole, hexymer, lorazepam and chlorpromazine. It worked wonderfully for about 2-3 months. Then something strange happened. When I was napping, I felt a searing headache that made me woke up from my nap. After that headache, I couldnt take a nap until now. I asked my psychiatrist but he didnt know what caused my headache and inability to take a nap. He just gave me the same cocktail. I could sleep fairly well at night but I couldnt take a nap, which made me frustrated because I love napping. What must I do? Should I change to another psychiatrist?",

        "text": "35 year old female, smoker, currently 322lbs 6ft tall BMI of 45, BPD with GAD that is well controlled with 120mg Duloxetine and 100mg chlorpromazine daily, ME/CFS with pain being treat with 30mg amitryptiline daily, PCOS being treat with 2000mg metformin daily and 30mg norethisterone daily for 10 days every 3 months to bring on menses, subclinical hypothyroidism being treat with 25mg levothyroxine daily, have been diagnosed with borderline type 2 diabetes but am not considered bad enough for further intervention considering I'm already prescribed metformin for PCOS\n\nSo I'm a morbidly obese woman who has struggled with my weight all my life. I am in the UK and am a candidate for bariatric surgery but I'm currently waiting for approval for funding for the surgery which given my list of medical issues is expected to be granted but as with everything in the NHS post COVID it's taking a while. \n\nIn the meantime I've been instructed to lose weight and I have been doing so slowly through calorie counting over the past year and a half. Some months I stalled or even gained a little back but it's been an overall downward trend and my bariatric team have been happy with my progress. At my heaviest I was 352lbs.\n\nThe problem is that my weight loss has suddenly increased rapidly with me going from losing a couple of pounds a month to losing 9lbs this month. My appetite has decreased dramatically in this time. I struggle to finish meals and probably would just forget to eat if my husband didn't bring me food.\n\nI recently started amitryptiline to treat ME/CFS related pain but there's been no other change in my medication. \n\nI know that as an obese woman who is headed towards bariatric surgery I should be thrilled with my losses but I'm worried that this sudden change in my appetite could be a sign of some underlying ill health and I don't want to end up ill so that I can't get my surgery. \n\nCould this be down to my recently starting amitryptiline? My decreased appetite didn't come on overnight when I started taking it but has been more gradual.\n\nMy bariatric team are thrilled with my progress and that's all they are focusing on but I wonder if it's worth seeing my GP for a checkup?",

I take 75mg venlafaxine a day and when really anxious take 25mg chlorpromazine as needed.\n\n\nAt times I get phrases stuck in my head that won't go away. Last night and today it's 'stupid, idiot' - it's like either two sides of my brain are saying either word. It's not 'voices' per say as it's my own internal dialogue but when it's 'loud' I can almost hear them. I can't usually stop them but I try distract myself best I can.\n\n\n\nI don't know if that makes sense. Usually its self deprecating like that, 'insane, evil' is one I've had recently too. I'm just guessing this is just something to do with having lots of mental health issues. It's only popped up in the last couple of months and I've actually been feeling better- however last night I self harmed because it was so 'loud' in my head and I couldn't take it.\n\n\n\nI guess I'm just asking if this is a thing that happens and is normal to a certain extent.\n\n\nEdit: will add that I do drink alcohol a decent amount, I smoke a couple cigarettes a day and also take recreational drugs occasionally. However this usually happens when I'm sober and I've cut down on a lot of that now too, so usually sober 9/10 days.",

Eventually, after trying several medications, an older, more experienced neurologist who had seen 5 cases in 30 years prescribed chlorpromazine - and it worked. Was fine for 7 years.\n\nThey started back up this past September. Chlorpromazine didn't work this time. Neither did baclofen, pregabalin, gabapentin, and one other I've forgotten as it actually made them worse. Yes, trigging vomiting will stop them - but only temporarily unless I lie down within about 15 minutes - so that's the go-to method just before going to bed. If I do it during the day, within max 20 minutes they start back up unless I lie down, at which point the effect lasts as long as I stay horizontal. Very often as soon as I sit up, they start again.\n\nMy GP is still getting appointments with various specialists, but so far all those who have seen me or done tests say everything is normal, of course. I'm a zebra, not a horse, to quote the old expression about diagnoses.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with what *might* be another option besides surgery/ nerve stimulators?",

I have been having cluster headaches daily since I felt a rubber band snapping like pain in my head back in January. I have had cluster headaches since I had a TBI when I was 13 however they have never been this severe and they have never been in this long of a cycle. I have gone to the ER numerous times and have had an x-ray and CT, been told there is no evidence of a \"recent brain bleed\" (to my knowledge I've never had a brain bleed). The pain comes usually upon waking up, mid day, and around 8:30-9 PM. I don't always have three cluster headaches in a day but I do have them everyday. The ER gives me a migraine cocktail that doesn't work and sends me home, my PCP did everything he could think of and refered me to a neurologist. I received Botox injections and there was no relief from that. I don't know what to do at this point, I feel like a doctor needs to take this more seriously as it has, for lack of better words, ruined my life. Now I have a soft bump where the pain is most profound and the ER says I bumped my head and do not remember and it's nothing to worry about. Triptans have proven to be useless. My medications are following and categorized, I rarely take OTC medication for the headaches because it does not work 95% of the time to take the edge off. None of my medications have been changed in the last 2+ years.

        "title": "Ran out of klonopin, can restoril help with panic attacks and anxiety?",
        "text": "I\u2019m a 39 year old caucasian female. I live in California. I\u2019m 5\u20192, 200lbs.\n\nI have a tendency to write too much and give too much info, so I tried to do a shorter version, if the longer version is just too much, although it's still long (sorry). The longer version has more details below that. I wasn't sure how much info to share. Pretty much included the shorter version in the longer version, longer version just has more details and the back story in the beginning. My health conditions and medications are listed below the longer version. \n\nSHORT(ER) VERSION: Current primary complaint is that I'm withdrawing from klonopin and not sure what to do. I have long history of addiction, many physical and mental health conditions. I have severe insomnia and seroquel is the most helpful medication I've found for sleep but causes weight gain. My weight fluctuations a lot. After a hospital stay for suicidal ideation in 2020 I did a partial hospitalzation program from 8/2020-2/2021 where I restarted seroquel at the end because I was only sleeping 3-4 hours a night and needed to sleep. I take 2,000mg of Metformin ER daily to try to prevent weight gain but it hasn't worked. 2/2021 up until now I've gained apps 50lbs. When I first tried seroquel years ago I gained 150lbs in 2 years. I have a history of eating disorders, mostly binge eating. Been on and off klonopin for years. For the past 4-6 months (I have memory issues so could be wrong) I've been VERY desperate to lose weight so I thought I could lose weight quickly by taking vyvanse at night (when I binge the most) and only eating every couple of days. I have panic attacks and an irregular heartbeat, so it's kind of risky. I went to the ER once after a bad panic attack from taking 50mg of vyvanse and a few cups of coffee. I started taking klonopin and propranolol with the vyvanse to help me calm down from the anxiety that I get from vyvanse and the irregular heartbeat. I haven't told any of my doctors what I've been doing. I wasn't losing any weight, even though I end up only eating every 2-3 days and I only sleep every couple days as well. I take vyvanse and adderral around the clock and then after 2-3 nights I stay up until around 6-8am and then use cannabis, about 3-4mg of Klonopin to come down from the stimulants and help me sleep. I use the seroquel as well. Anyway, so for 4-6 months I've been taking appx 120mg of vyvanse a day (60mg every 12 hours), plus 20mg-40mg Adderall IR over a 24 hour peroid (usually take 5-10mg at a time) when the vyvanse is wearing off but it's too soon to take another dose, or when I just need a little more of a pick me up. I take about 4-6mg of klonopin throughout a 24 hour peroid. I've felt really awful physically and mentally this whole time but my mental health has gotten especially bad. So I've wanted to stop this whole cycle, but so afraid of weight gain so on my binge/sleep days I started purging and taking laxatives after a binge. I still wasn't losing weight. So, obviously my plan is not working and I feel terrible, and haven't seen friends or family for so long bc I just feel too awful, and don't make any of my appts anymore or work anymore. So I was gonna start tapering off everything. I thought I had at least 2 more bottles of klonopin to get me through a tapering plan (I've tapered off many times by myself), and I have one doctor who does prescribe me klonopin, but only 30 1mg at month and I don't have a refill for another few weeks. So when I went to get the bottles I thought I had, they were gone. Either lost, or I probably just have been taking more than I realized. So suddenly one day I have zero klonopins left. I know it's dangerous and I'm not really sure what to do. It's been about 5 days now and I'm crying constantly, having suicidal thoughts (I am safe right now and have a therapist), and did have a panic attack, but took propranolol, restoril and gabapentin, which seemed to get me through it. Ok, so basically what I'm wondering is what are the chances I'll have a seizure, or something else? Would taking restoril (I have a few bottles of that), help get me through the detox process? I know it has a shorter half life, so I'm not really sure how much I should be taking and how often. I have 30mg bottles, 15mg bottles and 7.5mg bottles (I think). I tried to get an early refill of klonopin saying I lost it, but that didn't work. I'm still using the stimulants and cannabis, but just a little less to try to prevent a panic attack, and I'm taking gabapentin and propranolol throughout the day. When I was in detox before they had me taking gabapentin, among other meds, and I have a lot of gabapentin and am prescribed it as a prn, 1,200mg 1-3x per day), so will that be enough to prevent a seizure? I have my other meds listed below, along with some other meds that I have extra. Kind of at a loss of what to do. Not sure if I can ask what to do, but I'm just putting it out there in case anyone has any suggestions or anything. I want to get off all addictive substances, but it kind of feels impossible bc I can't tolerate my feelings, plus I can't live in this cycle anymore, yet I CAN'T gain anymore weight and I think it's possible that this cycle has kept me in the 195-205lb range when normally I would gain weight a lot faster. I'm working with a therapist around that. I want to avoid the ER or urgent care as I have been assaulted by a staff member in the ER. The urgent care where I'm at is weird and hard to get into for people with my insurance (long story). I have a lot of meds, so maybe some of them could help with the process. So... suggestions or advice that don't include going to the ER or urgent care? I can't live in this cycle anymore, yet I CAN'T gain anymore weight and I think it's possible that this cycle has kept me in the 195-205lb range when normally I would gain weight a lot faster. \n\nLONGER VERSION: Current primary complaint is that I'm withdrawing from klonopin and I'm not sure what to do. I have been taking klonopin on and off for about 20 years. I have a history of addiction. I drank excessively for about 15 years and quit 8 years ago (had to go to a detox center for 5 days), have also been to detox for klonopin 4 years ago. For the last 6 years I've also been using excessive amounts of cannabis, mostly edibles, about 40-50mg of thc daily. For the last 6 years I've also been using stimulants (vyvanse and adderall). I was originally prescribed vyvanse for binge eating disorder. After I detoxed from klonopin I quickly relapsed. I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation in July of 2020. I've had about 15 hospitalizations for suicidal ideation (10 in 2009 and 5 in 2017) and I've attended many partial hospitalization programs. I've been in and out of substance abuse programs, including AA and NA, for the past 20 years. Longest peroid of sobriety was after my detox 8 yeras ago. I was originally prescribed klonopin about 20 years ago because I was experiencing panic attacks that get so bad that I'm 100% convinced I'm dying and I end up calling 911 and go to the hospital where they just give me a benzo anyway. I was off klonopin for those 2 years of sobriety, except when I'd have a panic attack. The panic attacks, without the use of cannabis or stimulants, happen maybe 3 times per month. I kept getting refills and had a stash that I thought would last me years. I was doing ok until 2016 when my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer (she was a downwinders victim) and I began a toxic relationship around the same time. My mom lived for exactly one year after her diagnosis (was diagnosed June 30th of 2016 and passed away on June 30th of 2017). My mental health went downhill very quickly after her diagnosis and my relationship started. I moved in with my bf who was an addict and he relapsed on cannabis and stimulants a couple months after we moved in together and my substance use went way up then (mostly cannabis and klonopin) bc I couldn't deal with what I was going through and plus the substances were there and I wanted a way to connect with my bf. I was taking about 4-5mg of klonopin daily, smoking cannabis all day most days and after about 1 year of being with him I started using vyvanse. I went to detox for the klonopin in 2018 but relapsed a couple days after on weed, cannabis and stimulants. Until about 6 months ago I was just using about 1-2mgs of klonopin a day for sleep or when I had a panic attack. Appx 3-4 days a week I'd use the klonopin with with cannabis because cannabis often causes me to have panic attacks, but the combination of klonopin and cannbis is something I enjoy very much and is the closest I've felt to drinking. Alcohol was always my 1st choice but caused too many problems. I can't use stimulants or cannabis without klonopin because it causes me to have panic attacks. I have been on and off seroquel for about 20 years as well and my whole life I've experienced extreme weight fluctuations. I've been 90lbs and I've been 300lbs. In my 20s my weight fluctuated between 150lbs-240lbs and then when I was taking 200mgs of seroquel my weight went up to 300lbs. Once I found out I had celiac and cut out the gluten I started losing some weight and then when I quit drinking I lost more. In 2016 I was 200lbs but then during the year my mom got sick I was never hungry because of the anxiety and depression I was experiencing throughout it all. I lost 50lbs in 1 year and then gained back 60lbs over the next year. I always become more depressed when my weight goes up. I was off vyvanse and stimulants and just using cannabis and klonopin. I stayed in the 200-215 pound range from 2017-2020 and then I started losing weight. Btw I am a serial monogomist, am codependent and have attachment trauma and am like a relationship addict but when my weight is up I don't even try, I mostly just isolate. Whenever I experience the excitement of a new relationship then I stop caring about food as much and lose weight, so once I got involved with him I was losing weight. So between 7/2020-9/2020 I lost 50lbs. I met a man in the hospital and got involved with him and started losing weight. I have severe insomnia and without seroquel it takes about 3-4 hours to fall asleep and with seroquel it takes about an hour. The only other things that have helped me sleep are saphris, which was not as helpful as seroquel but maybe the 2nd most helpful medication I've tried for sleep. It takes about 2 hours to fall asleep on saphris, but I still experienced the weight gain with it, so I just stuck with seroquel and klonopin since that combo was more effective. I didn't really NEED the klonopin with the seroquel, but I'd take it earlier in the evening to relax. When I combine cannabis and klonopin that also helps me sleep within a couple of hours, but I still experience the weight gain bc of the munchies. Alcohol also helped me sleep, but I quit drinking 8 years ago. I've tried EVERYTHING under the sun for sleep that's out there, trust me. Even without being on stimulants. Ambien did nothing, I tried taking up to 200mg of benadryl and it did nothing, trazadone did nothing and I could go on and on and on about everything I've tried, and even at the highest doses, that did nothing or had minimal effects. If I combine about 6 different meds that don't cause weight gain (1,200mg gabapentin, 200mg benadryl, 20mg propranolol, 30mg restoril, unison, melatonin) then I can fall asleep within 2 hours usually. So for a while there (about 2 months) I was using that combination and used restoril instead of klonopin, but it was just too many meds and would make me super drowsy the next day. I was always tired and so my dr prescribed modafinil and that made me too anxious and so I went back to vyvanse bc that helps me with energy, plus I thought it would help prevent weight gain and also it just helps me be more outgoing and fun. I ended up going back to seroquel and Klonopin for sleep bc I didnt want to be on 6 meds for sleep. The relationship I was in died and shortly after that I got into another one but that only lasted 2 months and then I met another guy and we've been involved for over a year now. It's not a relationship though, it's a whole big mess of toxicity, codpedency and verbal and mental abuse. It is a sexual relationship as well, but we don't want to be in a relationshiop together, we seem to just be addicted to eachother and all the drama. He kept mentioning my weight gain and trying to control what I ate and I'd feel so bad and binge everytime after I hung out with him. So I think the weight gain has happened bc of the combination of seroquel, the situation with the guy (all the excitement that usually causes me to lose weight died within 2 months), the isolation and depression around covid. Oh, plus I've never been very active before but before I experienced all this weight gain I had really gotten into hiking and then last summer all these things happened. I started lexapro and I've had mixed opinions from doctors about weight gain from lexapro. I've asked about 10 different doctors and half of them say lexapro is weight neutral and the other half say they've seen a lot of patients gain weight on it. In July I moved into my own place, it was the 1st time living alone in 10 years, then 2 weeks after I moved I broke my foot and couldn't be active and then about a month later I started having migraines all the time for about a couple months. I had never experienced migraines before but then suddenly had a 2 week migraine, then more, after visiting family over the summer when the smoke was really bad. So, I was basically homebound for a few months and got used to that and ever since July, when I moved. I gained more weight after July. I went from about 175lbs-200lbs since July. I was already gaining weight before that, but it started happening faster after all of that. I have memory issues (mild cognitive impairment), but I'm guessing sometime around 4-6 months ago I became really desperate to lose weight. I mostly binge at night so I started taking vyvanse at night and staying up all night and sleeping all day. The stimulants caused a lot of anxiety, so I started taking klonpin and propanolol around the clock too. Then I started staying up 2-3 nights at a time and not eating for 2-3 days. I'd always want to stay up longer but my body would not allow it. I would come down from the stimulants with klonopin and cannabis and then take seroquel to finally sleep. I'm sorry, the next part might be repetitive but I'm feeling too awful to keep typing so I'm gonna copy and paste some from the shorter version.  - I started taking klonopin and propranolol with the vyvanse to help me calm down from the anxiety that I get from vyvanse and the irregular heartbeat. I haven't told any of my doctors what I've been doing. I wasn't losing any weight, even though I end up only eating every 2-3 days and I only sleep every couple days as well. I take vyvanse and adderral around the clock and then after 2-3 nights I stay up until around 6-8am and then use cannabis, about 3-4mg of Klonopin to come down from the stimulants and help me sleep. I use the seroquel as well. Anyway, so for 4-6 months I've been taking appx 120mg of vyvanse a day (60mg every 12 hours), plus 20mg-40mg Adderall IR over a 24 hour peroid (usually take 5-10mg at a time) when the vyvanse is wearing off but it's too soon to take another dose, or when I just need a little more of a pick me up. I take about 4-6mg of klonopin throughout a 24 hour peroid. I've felt really awful physically and mentally this whole time but my mental health has gotten especially bad. So I've wanted to stop this whole cycle, but so afraid of weight gain so on my binge/sleep days I started purging and taking laxatives after a binge. I still wasn't losing weight. So, obviously my plan is not working and I feel terrible, and haven't seen friends or family for so long bc I just feel too awful, and don't make any of my appts anymore or work anymore. So I was gonna start tapering off everything but I'm also TERRIFIED bc I can't live in this cycle anymore, yet I CAN'T gain anymore weight and I think it's possible that this cycle has kept me in the 195-205lb range when normally I would gain weight a lot faster.  I thought I had at least 2 more bottles of klonopin to get me through a tapering plan (I've tapered off many times by myself), and I have one doctor who does prescribe me klonopin, but only 30 1mg at month and I don't have a refill for another few weeks. So when I went to get the bottles I thought I had, they were gone. Either lost, or I probably just have been taking more than I realized. So suddenly one day I have zero klonopins left. I know it's dangerous and I'm not really sure what to do. It's been about 5 days now and I'm crying constantly, having suicidal thoughts (I am safe right now and have a therapist), and did have a panic attack, but took propranolol, restoril and gabapentin, which seemed to get me through it. Ok, so basically what I'm wondering is what are the chances I'll have a seizure, or something else? Would taking restoril (I have a few bottles of that), help get me through the detox process? I know it has a shorter half life, so I'm not really sure how much I should be taking and how often. I have 30mg bottles, 15mg bottles and 7.5mg bottles (I think). I tried to get an early refill of klonopin saying I lost it, but that didn't work. I'm still using the stimulants and cannabis, but just a little less to try to prevent a panic attack, and I'm taking gabapentin and propranolol throughout the day. When I was in detox before they had me taking gabapentin, among other meds, and I have a lot of gabapentin and am prescribed it as a prn, 1,200mg 1-3x per day), so will that be enough to prevent a seizure? I have my other meds listed below, along with some other meds that I have extra. Kind of at a loss of what to do. Not sure if I can ask what to do, but I'm just putting it out there in case anyone has any suggestions or anything. I want to get off all addictive substances, but it kind of feels impossible bc I can't tolerate my feelings. I'm working with a therapist around that. I want to avoid the ER or urgent care as I have been assaulted by a staff member in the ER. The urgent care where I'm at is weird and hard to get into for people with my insurance (long story). I have a lot of meds, so maybe some of them could help with the process. So... suggestions or advice that don't include going to the ER or urgent care? \n\n\nExisting medical conditions: Hypothyroidism (due to a partial thyroidectomy 11/2020 because of papillary thyroid cancer), possible hashimotos (thyroid peroxidase antibodies were slightly elevated, tests showed up as 13H), celiac disease, long history of eating disorders (mostly binging, some purging and restricting), mild cognive impairment (don't think it's due to all the meds bc I have the same issues off meds), low blood pressure, high platelets, obesity, supraventricular tachycardia, tenia versicolor, chronic pain due to injuries, hyponatremia (I'm ALWAYS thirsty and drink about 2 gallons of water a day, not diabetic), panic disorder, complex ptsd, major depression, anxiety, insomnia, alcoholism, drug addiction, possible borderline personality disorder.\n\nSorry if some of this doesn't make sense. I am not in a good mental state. \n\nIn case it's relevent at all, I've tried TMS and it didn't work. I did ketamine for a year and it didn't work. I could do ECT but some of my docs think that it wouldn't help since they say my symptoms could be a result of the trauma and that ECT wont work for that type of depression. Some docs say it's possible it would work and worth a try. I've known about a dozen people who have done ECT and none of their symptoms have improved, it just seems to make their memory really bad. I tried using all natural methods before, had a functional medicine doctor, got off all meds for a couple years, and did acupuncure, meditation and saw an amino acid coach or therapist or speciaslist changed my diet... i can't remember, but I did the mood cure protocol by julia Ross. Didn't do much for me. \n\nMedications: \n\n\n- Prescribed daily meds: 50mg tirosint 5x per week, 5mcg cytomel,10mg lexapro, 2,000mg metformin ER(is it even safe to take metformin since I'm not eating many days?), 400mg lamictal, 60mg vyvanse (though I end up taking about 120mg daily), 20mg adderall IR (end up taking appx 40mg daily), 1mg klonopin (prior to running out was taking appx 4-6mg daily), 25-200mg seroquel, 10mg melatonin, 21mg nicotine patch + thoughtout the day maybe a total of 30mg of nicotine from lozenges, 0.1% azelastine nasal spay, flonase\n\n- Prns: 300-1,200mg gabapentin 1-3x per day, 20mg propranolol 1-3x per day, 25mg doxepin as needed (I rarely use), 15mg meloxicam 1x per day, 8mg zofran (use often bc of constant nausea, perhaps due to lack of food and the binging), \n\nDaily vitamins and supplements: Daily: 10,000iu vitamin d, 15mg l methofolate, multivitamin, iron supplement, chromium, vitamin b, chromium\n- supplements I have but currenly use sometimes, rarely or not at all: l-gulatmiine, chromium, saffron extrac, l-theanine, magnesium, gaba, 5 http, passionflower, omegas, DLPA\n\nLeftover meds: Modafinil 100mg and 200mg pills, 5mg and 10mg saphris,100mg trazadone, 15mg atarax, 50mg naltrexone, 50mg tramadol, wellbutrin xl 150mg and 300mg tablets, chlorpromazine, Prazosin 0.1mg, clonidine, 25mg desvenlasafaxine, norcos 5/325 and 10/325, 10mg ambien, 20mg omeprazole, 25mg chlorpromazine, prazosine, and probably more, but I just have so many bags of meds I'd need to go through",

I've googled this once and saw something about skin bacteria that could ferment and produce some weird gases, but I'm not that sure if I should just go down into antibiotics without any suggestion (since I work in a lab that deals with multi-resistant bacteria).\n\nI tried using deodorant with aluminum, which helped for sometime, but even though I still have to take at least 2 or 3 shirts with me anywhere I go because within hours I'll be stinking (mainly from my armpits). Sometimes, even with barely using the deodorant I feel like cold sweating, and my anxiety goes up just by the though of making  an unpleasant area around me. \n\nThe point is: I have no money to pay a dermatologist and living in a tropical country makes my life really hard, to the point that sometimes I won't go to social events due to the fact that I'm afraid of this smell. My shirts are now getting this weird odor and it seems nothing can get them off, I know I may sound crazy, but this is really, really bothersome to me, and makes me very afraid of hanging with my friends or anyone.\n\nSome important facts:  \n\\- I had those kind of odor when I was younger, mid 15y then no more.\n\n\\- I'm bipolar, so I take meds (Lithium) and even some anxiolytics (Alprazolam and chlorpromazine) but I don't think that's the origin of the problem.\n\n\\- Even when I'm not in a crowded environment, in my room alone, anyway, I still have this problem, so I don't think it's associated with social interaction, although it may have some influence.\n\n\\- I do shave. I do tried using more than one deodorant. I take usually 2 baths/day. There's no difference between different shirts fabric. I do not use perfume nor anything except neutral anymore.\n\nSorry if my english sounds weird, I'm not a native speaker so it might look clumsy. Anyway, if someone could help me I would be very, very, very happy. Thanks in advance.",

This is one of the hundreds way that I'm trying to find some help.\n\nMy mother lives in Italy (I'm in Germany) and she's locked at home since beginning of COVID-19 with her mother (78F), with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThings are getting out of hand, to say the least. And I cannot go there to take some stress off from my mom.\n\nMy grandma is peeing on the floor, she's beating my aunt, she walks around naked..like, \"funny\" for us that we don't have to deal with this on a daily basis in lockdown while managing our job and our own stress...but yeah, my mom has to do that, and it's no fun.\n\nMy mom can't sleep, cause my grandma would go to sleep too early (8pm) and wake up at 5am.

I currently take 150mg lamotrigine and 50 mg chlorpromazine at night and 50mg of lamotrigine in the morning.  \nI took one cap size of MDMA (about 0.1mg) on Saturday night (last night) at approx. 2100pm and two caps (about 0.2mg) on Friday at approx. 2200pm. This was also accompanied by heavy drinking (about 10 standard drinks on Friday, at least 10 standard drinks on Saturday). When I took the MDMA initially both times I felt completely fine as I'm used to taking that amount and in fact was pretty low compared to other times I've taken it. But at approx. 0318am Sunday (about 5 hours after I had ingested the second dose of MDMA) I started to not feel alright. I started to shake, I was scared of putting my hands near my face, my vision was blurry, very sensitive to light, I was thinking incredibly scary thoughts and was very sure something bad was going to happen. These symptoms I had never ever felt before after taking MDMA. I felt as if something was wrong. I had already taken my night medication by that point also so I was very tired and ended up falling asleep.\n\nFast forward to today, I woke up at 1400pm and felt reasonably fine. Went about my day as usual, but then the same symptoms and feelings from 0318am started to come back but in waves. I would feel alright for a second but then start having delusional thoughts and becoming very unwell. It is 2000pm and it is still happening. Unsure of what to do, will probably wait until morning to see a doctor as they are not open on weekends.\n\nI've been keeping up my fluid intake with hydralyte and also have eaten two meals.\n\nI am unsure of what to do, and mainly here to ask what could be going on. I've looked up drug interactions with my medication and I was under the impression that it was reasonably safe to take a small amount. I've been taking MDMA occasionally since I was 18. I take it at most about once a month but also have gone months without having it. I mainly use MDMA at special events. I have never felt like this after taking drugs at all either. It feels very different to a come-down or a hangover. I am having waves of imagining things in my head and paranoia today alongside everything else. Could this be seratonin syndrome? Am I overthinking things?\n\nI know that mixing drugs with my mental illness is incredibly risky and I am currently undergoing DBT, and I'd appreciate it if people wouldn't make comments to do with stopping drugs. I am doing my best to stop this but life and social situations can get in the way sometimes.\n\nWould love to hear your opinion and will update the thread tomorrow once I am able to book in with a GP.",

        "title": "Second year female medical student in the middle of sudden 5-day long \"migraine\" attack with no Hx - IV drugs in hospital didn't relieve - please help!",
        "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm a 27 yo female and about 5 days ago I started getting really bad headaches with no apparent trigger (although I did receive a very light knock to the side of the head around the same time but nothing special - very minor bruising - ER doc didn't seem to think much of that).  Symptom-wise they seem migrainous - I have been getting assoc. nausea / vomiting, photophobia etc.  No aura.  The pain is mostly bilateral at all times and in the frontal / temporal region.\n\nLying supine *usually* provides almost instant relief, and as soon as I get up the headaches slowly return.  Paracetamol / ibuprofen seem to do very little to move the pain when I am moving around or sitting up, although they *may* help if I take them and lie down (then again it may just be the lying down).  I can't tolerate codeine (makes me vomit).\n\nThey were so bad during a class at the hospital yesterday that I left early and presented to the ER.  The ER doc ran a head CT (without contrast) which was clear and gave me IV chlorpromazine / fluids for symptom relief.  After being in the ER for a couple of hours w the IV I did feel better, so I was discharged.  However as soon as I started to move around after being discharged (like within minutes) I started to feel the rumblings of it returning.  I went back to the student lounge and literally passed out on a couch for five hours, which wasn't very ladylike of me (I felt indescribably exhausted).  When I woke up the headache was gone but then after walking around for a while it returned on my way home and became almost as bad as before.  \n\nI am only in my second year of medicine and I do not know a lot about headaches or migraine yet but I am just really worried about the fact that the IV drugs haven't terminated it, that it's been going on for 5 days and that it is a sudden onset with unknown cause and no history of migraine whatsoever.  I've never had a migraine before and I've never been prone to headaches ever - I get them very rarely and when they do come 2 advil is all I've ever needed to shift them.  I'm concerned about underlying pathology and also I am completely unable to go to class atm. I've just started second year and I really don't want to fall behind!\n\nI'm seeing my GP tomorrow hopefully but in the meantime I was just wondering if anybody had any thoughts.\n\nI'm wondering if I have a postural headache caused by CSF leak from the light knock to the head?\n",

        "comment": "Just a medical student, but I can give you my $0.02 based on my understanding of the medications that you're on. \n\nZolpidem is a pretty horrible drug for the long term treatment of insomnia. It work -- in the short term -- but patients can have issues with tolerance and it is somewhat habit forming. There are probably better options (i'm guessing you've tried most of them) but its not a great drug for people to be taking every night. \n\nSimilarly Xanax is a terrible medication for the treatment of anxiety. Its very addictive, very challenging to stop taking, and only provides short term relief of symptoms and really only masks the anxiety. Its basically only used to help treat panic attacks until a better medication regimine can be started. \n\nWhy are you afraid to stop these medications? What do you think the benifit will be if/when you stop them? \n\nI would caution you that you really shouldn't change your dose or stop taking any of these medications without talking with your doctor first about it (xanax, especially, can be dangerous if you've been taking it daily and suddenly stop)",

        "text": " 7 Popular Medication Classes For Anxiety, Explained By an RN\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Selective_Serotonin_Reuptake_Inhibitors_SSRIs)\n* [Azapirones](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Azapirones)\n* [Antihistamines](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Antihistamines)\n* [Benzodiazepines](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Benzodiazepines)\n* [Beta Blockers](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Beta_Blockers)\n* [Tricyclic Antidepressant\u00a0 | TCAs](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Tricyclic_Antidepressant_TCAs)\n* [Antipsychotics](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Antipsychotics)\n* [Medication Log PDF](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Free_Medication_Log_PDF)\n\n## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs\n\n**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**\n\nDrug class\n\nThis is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain.\n\n**Over 10% of the US** takes an SSRI\n\nWhat Do SSRIs Do?\n\nWhat does **every** medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, you\u2019re blocking the neurons from *reabsorbing* Serotonin, meaning there is **more Serotonin** available.\n\nSince this medication increases serotonin levels, you\u2019ll have more of it to regulate your mood and symptoms of anxiety. Your brain also has to adapt to more Serotonin. It\u2019s thought that by your brain having to restructure from an increase in serotonin, it becomes more able to \u201cremodel\u201d and better able to adapt to stressors like anxiety.\n\nSo what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, and our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nSerotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. We can measure the levels in our blood, but we can\u2019t measure the levels within our brain. Meaning we\u2019re all in the dark as to how much we have in our brain.\n\n## Azapirones\n\n**Buspar Buspirone**\u00a0\n\nDrug Class\n\nBuspirone is in the drug class of Azapirones. There is no addiction risk, overall there are less side effects than many other anxiolytic medicines. It can take up to a month for the medication to work fully. Typically prescribed for *generalized* anxiety.\n\nWhat Does It Do?\n\nThis drug class impacts serotonin and dopamine receptors. The full mechanism of the drug aren\u2019t known actually. But, because it seems to take 2-4 weeks to make a difference, that would mean it likely has to do with the receptors for serotonin and dopamine.\n\nIt is thought that by the receptors adjusting, it can make them more adaptive and therefore *better able* to handle stress. Another possibility is that by blocking serotonin receptors, an increase of serotonin is available, which improves symptoms for some types of anxiety disorders.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe drug Buspar was originally developed for schizophrenia, but wasn\u2019t useful. It did however seem to help people with anxiety. Dizziness seems to be one of the most common complaints as far as side effects.\n\n## Antihistamines\n\n**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom,\u00a0 hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan,\u00a0 triprolidine, triafed**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different \u2018generations\u2019 & target different histamine receptors in our body.\n\n* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body\n* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion\n* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System\n* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched\n\nWhat Do Antihistamines Do?\n\nWe\u2019re actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that\u00a0**anti-**histamines are usually anticholinergic;\u00a0**blocking** receptors for choline.\n\n**Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax** are commonly prescribed for anxiety.\n\nWhile your risks with this drug class are much less severe than when taking benzodiazepines, these are first generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this also means they can impair our ability to remember, think and learn. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain.\n\nAn example of **second** generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won\u2019t do you much good.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways **in addition** to the reason why it\u2019s administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much **less** specific in their effects, they have more side effects.\n\nThough, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings (for anxiety included).\n\n## Benzodiazepines\n\n**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThese are commonly used as anxiety medicines (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.\n\nThis drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which **slows down** our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).\n\nAnesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?\n\nThe Drawbacks of Benzos\n\nWhen Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is we\u2019re now in a benzo addiction crisis. We\u2019re learning over time as a society, and those changes don\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nThis drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is **advantageously quick acting**, the effects linger.\u00a0 Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory.\n\nThe effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.\n\nThis is why a rehab center isn\u2019t going to allow the use of this drug class while recovering. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking benzodiazepines while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning at full capacity & you\u2019re not able to retain information, progress becomes much more difficult.\n\nThe most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.\n\nObviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They\u2019re a life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with consistent\u00a0*repeated*\u00a0use we will need\u00a0**increasingly** higher doses.\n\nAnother point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.\n\nThis is often what is referred to as\u00a0*\u201c****rebound anxiety****\u201d*\u00a0 because your anxiety is likely to get worse, **before** it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken frequently and long term.\n\nThe mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time. I\u2019ve even worked with prescribers who won\u2019t prescribe them, period.\n\nNow, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please don\u2019t go flush yours down the toilet after reading this!\n\n## Beta Blockers\n\n**acebutolol, atenolol, tenormin, bisoprolol, zebeta, metoprolol, lopressor, toprol XL, nadolol, corgard, nebivolol, bystolic, propranolol, inderal, innopran XL**\n\nDrug Class\n\nA beta blocker is most often used for heart conditions since this drug class lowers blood pressure and heart rate. But, they do this by blocking epinephrine which we commonly refer to as adrenaline. By blocking adrenaline, you prevent the progression of the physical symptoms of anxiety, like increased heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nThese can be prescribed \u201cas needed\u201d and is also prescribed long term to be taken regularly.\u00a0 Sometimes doctors will prescribe them for public speaking, or other stressful events someone has to face.\n\nWhat do Beta Blockers Do?\n\nWell, they Block Beta-adrenergic receptors, preventing norepinephrine and epinephrine from activating those receptors. This relaxes heart muscles, slows the heart beat, and lowers blood pressure.\n\nThat might seem completely unrelated to anxiety to some people, but when anxiety starts it will create **physical symptoms** that tend to make us feel even more panicked. This is why it can be pretty helpful to stop the physical symptoms from escalating an already *not-so-good* state of mind.\n\nDid you know?\n\nBeta blockers can be used for tremors, migraines, abnormal heart rhythms, and chest pain too.\n\nSummary\n\nBeta blockers can be a useful anxiety medication. As a nurse some of the things I pay attention to when a patient is prescribed them are obviously heart rate and blood pressure. **Energy level** is always something that can be impacted too.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for someone to become tired, groggy, lightheaded, or get headaches from beta blockers. Even for people who take it for high blood pressure and heart rate, it can have a tendency to drop them too low.\n\nEveryone is different, our diets change, our weight changes, our stress levels change, how hydrated we are fluctuates, our salt intake varies; and **all of these** impact our blood pressure. So, it\u2019s always a good idea to be keeping an eye on your heart performance with a beta blocker and your doctor who is prescribing should be too.\n\n## Tricyclic Antidepressant\u00a0 | TCAs\n\n**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThe word \u201ctricyclic\u201d refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed **before** SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays.\n\nTCAs are still often prescribed for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.\n\nWhat do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?\n\nWhat do **all** TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors.\n\nThese key differences from SSRIs create a cascade of effects in the body that make them a bit more likely to cause side effects; like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nIn 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 (a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new \u2018invention\u2019 was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.\n\nSummary\n\nThese drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life, while for another it can leave a bad impression.\n\n\\*Note each drug **within** the class impacts the *degree* of these effects a little differently.\n\n## Antipsychotics\n\n**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics**\n\n**risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette\u2019s syndrome, Huntington\u2019s disease, and anxiety.\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nMost drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.\n\nSchizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it\u2019s to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.\n\nThis class is broken up into two categories;\n\n**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which can impact our cognition and the complex way in which we store memories.\n\n\\*More movement disorders come with the first generation antipsychotics.\n\n**Second Generation: (new, atypical):**\u00a0Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors**.**\u00a0Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.\n\nHopefully this helps clarify some information on these common 7 classes of medications. If not feel free to submit a question in the comments, or by using my contact form below and I\u2019ll do my best to answer.\n\nOriginal Post  [https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/)",

        "title": "Memory Loss and Mental Health Medications",
        "text": "Memory loss is a common topic within the mental health world. I'm an RN that works in Mental Health & going to do my best to summarize some research on *which* mental health medications impact our memory and *why* they do.\n\n**Memory** refers to the mechanisms that are used to collect, accumulate, preserve, and later retrieve information. There are three actions involved in **'memory'**: processing, storing, and recalling.\n\n## I will Include the link to the original post that is probably easier to follow but also going to include all the info below.\n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs\n\n**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**\n\n### Drug class\n\nThis is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain. Over 10% of the US takes an SSRI.\n\n### What Do SSRIs Do?\n\nWhat does every medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, you\u2019re blocking the neurons from reabsorbing Serotonin, meaning there is more Serotonin available.\n\nSo what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nSerotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. While we can measure the levels in our blood we cannot measure the levels within our brain. Meaning we\u2019re all in the dark as to how much is within our brain and whether or not it\u2019s even correlated to the amount in our blood.\n\nHow SSRIs Impact Memory\n\nAge and gender do not seem to influence the data that SSRIs are correlated with memory effects. Something that is important to mention, is that while research has shown that SSRIs are *correlated* with memory loss, that doesn\u2019t exactly mean that they CAUSE it. Correlation and cause are two different things. Many people that take SSRIs also take benzodiazepines, drink, smoke, have genetic predisposition to memory loss, etc. Depression and anxiety themselves can even cause memory problems.\n\nSummary\n\nSo, after reading through many articles, there overall wasn\u2019t enough credible information to emphatically say that an SSRI causes memory loss. In fact, I came across more research that suggested SSRIs improve cognitive performance and memory. Some data also specifically supported that SSRI\u2019s can improve memory for patients experiencing psychosis and depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Tricyclic Antidepressant\u00a0 | TCAs\n\n**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThe word \u201ctricyclic\u201d refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed before SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays. TCAs are still often administered for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.\n\nWhat do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?\n\nWhat do all TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors. These key differences create a cascade of effects in the body that do impact memory. These key differences are also the culprit for the common side effects in this drug class like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nIn 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 ( a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new 'invention' was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.\n\nHow TCAs Impact Memory\n\nThere are multiple reasons why a TCA impacts our memory. **The first reason** is that we retain memory best when norepinephrine is released at an optimal rate. These drugs block the reabsorption of norepinephrine; which is known to be a moderator of memory. With too much of it, we are anxious and stressed, too little of it and we are drowsy and not as coherent. Either way, the drug has an impact on norepinephrine which directly influences how we store memory.\n\n**The second reason** why this drug class impacts memory is because it competes with our natural antagonists on muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is well documented that these drugs block muscarinic receptors (which is an acetylcholine receptor), and acetylcholine directly impacts learning and memory.\n\n>*\u201cMuscarinic*\u00a0acetylcholine\u00a0*receptors* in the hippocampus and cortex underlie\u00a0*memory*\u00a0formation\u201d\n\nSummary\n\nSo, TCAs are a drug that research has linked with memory impairments and dementia. These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life (even could improve memory if their extreme anxiety was impairing it), while for another it can make them drowsy and leave a bad impression.\n\n\\*Note each drug within the class impacts the degree of these effects a little differently.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling like doing a deep dive into some of the articles I read to gain clarity, by all means, click the links below!\n\n[Differential Cognitive Actions of Norepinephrine \u03b12 and \u03b11 Receptor Signaling in the Prefrontal Cortex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4876052/)\n\n[The effect of tricyclic antidepressants on cholinergic responses of single cortical neurones.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1666268/?page=7)\n\n[A brief history of antidepressant drug development: from tricyclics to beyond ketamine](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-neuropsychiatrica/article/brief-history-of-antidepressant-drug-development-from-tricyclics-to-beyond-ketamine/B5C9D55C6299BC41B237187DB609DB68)\n\n## \n\n## Benzodiazepines\n\n**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThese are commonly considered anti-anxiety medication (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s taco \u2018bout it.\n\nThis drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which slows down our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).\n\nDid You Know?\n\nAnesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?\n\nHow Benzodiazepines Impact Memory\n\nThis drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is advantageously quick acting, the effects linger.\u00a0 Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.\n\nThis is why a rehab center isn\u2019t going to allow the use of 'said drug' while \u2018recovering\u2019. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking 'said drug' while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning & you're not able to remember anything, how can you work on it? The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.\n\nNow, don't shoot the messenger. Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They're an actual life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with *repeated* use we will need *increasingly* higher doses, making the dent in your memory more and more indisputable.\n\nFull Disclosure\n\nMy mother was an addict, benzodiazepines being her drug of choice.\n\nDo you know an addict whose drug of choice is a benzodiazepine? No SHAME, but if so, you can probably attest that **they don\u2019t remember shit.**\u00a0\n\nHow about an addict whose drug of choice is alcohol? All love here, but you can say for certain, *they don\u2019t remember shit*.\n\nThere has even been a fair amount of data to support that the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s is elevated in those taking the drug for over 6 months. One Harvard study even speculated that it would raise the risk by 84%! Seems unrealistic, but who am I to question Harvard; I'll add the link below if you're also feeling speculative.\n\nAnother point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.\n\nThis is often what is referred to as *\u201crebound anxiety\u201d*\u00a0 because your anxiety is likely to get worse, before it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken long term.\n\nTake it from a nurse who works in mental health; it's not enjoyable being the bystander of a patient trying to escape their benzo addiction.\n\nBut this is why the mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time.\n\nNow, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please don\u2019t go flush yours down the toilet after reading this.\n\nWhen Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is that we\u2019re now in a benzo addiction crisis. We\u2019re learning over time, as a society and those changes don\u2019t happen overnight. And trust me, as a mental health professional I myself occasionally grow infuriated at the amount of family doctors who prescribe copious amounts of benzodiazepines only to later turn the patient away after addiction has crippled them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Harvard Article Claims Benzodiazepine use may raise risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/benzodiazepine-use-may-raise-risk-alzheimers-disease-201409107397#:~:text=People%20who%20had%20taken%20a%20benzodiazepine%20for%20three,84%25.%20The%20type%20of%20drug%20taken%20also%20mattered.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cRight now I\u2019m having amnesia and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at the same time. I think I\u2019ve forgotten this before.\u201d  \n\u2015\u00a0Steven Wright\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Anti-Epileptics\n\ntopiramate, topamax, zonisamide, zonegran, levetiracetam, keppra, pregabalin, lyrica, clonazepam, klonopin, rufinamide, banzel, vigabatrin,\u00a0 sabril, phenytoin, dilantin, oxcarbazepine, trileptal, carbamazepine, tegretol, lamotrigine, lamictal, lacosamide, vimpat, valproic acid, depakote, phenobarbital, gabapentin, neurontin\n\nDrug Class\n\nAnti-seizure medications are commonly used for mood disorders and even anxiety in addition to epilepsy.\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nEpilepsy is caused by **excessive** hyperexcitability of the nervous system therefore, medications in this class are geared toward minimizing excitability. This drug class actually encompasses three different major classes\n\n1. Blocking Sodium Channels\n2. Enhancement of GABA Inhibition\n3. Regulation of Synaptic Releases\n\nWhy it Impacts Memory\n\nOverall, anticonvulsants work in different ways; trust me I rode the magic school for HOURS trying to gain an understanding of them to write this. Truthfully, we still have a lot to learn about them. Their impact is complicated and the effects range based on the dose and drug.\n\nFor instance, Topamax has pretty diverse pharmacologic actions, because of that, it **has** been linked with impaired concentration, cognitive dulling, psychomotor retardation, language and comprehension difficulties, rather extreme effects on short-term memory and working memory, poor verbal fluency and word-finding, reduced IQ scores, abnormal thinking and delayed cognitive speed. Because of this dark cloud of side effects, Topamax is sometimes referred to as 'Dope-A-Max'.\n\nHowever, a more selective medication within the drug class such as Phenytoin or Tegretol are more specific to blocking sodium channels. Overall, they seem to have less impact on memory and cognitive function.\n\nMany of these drugs listed above have an impact on GABA, and long term exposure to GABA agents can alter the functionality of GABA permanently, which means there are potentially permanent consequences to cognition, behaviors, and memory.\n\nPhenobarbital has been linked to lower IQ, and worse effects than Depakote and Tegretol, however it is actually a barbituate. It\u2019s effects are similar to benzodiazepines which you can read more about above.\n\nGabapentin, used for seizures and often mood disorders, belongs to it's own drug class. Still, it **has** been linked to memory impairment. Hence, the name, it also impacts GABA, which as mentioned several times now, certainly plays a hand in our ability to remember. At this point there isn\u2019t enough research to say it\u2019s linked to dementia though.\n\nAs far as drugs for epilepsy, Gabapentin is tolerated much better than many others. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that this drug seems to have more *short term* effects on memory. Some will experience a disorienting feeling or short term memory loss while taking Gabapentin, but the reports of long term memory being impacted are reported less often.\n\n[Long Term Effects of Gabapentin](https://deserthopetreatment.com/sedatives/gabapentin-addiction/long-term-side-effects/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Antipsychotics\n\n**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics; risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome & Huntington's disease\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nMost drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nOddly enough, memory seems to actually be improved when using an antipsychotic for a person with psychotic symptoms, though there are many that take medications within this class that are not psychotic. So let's talk about that more.\n\nWhy It Impacts Memory\n\nFirst, let's skip back to the purpose of these drugs. Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it's to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.\n\nThis class is broken up into two categories;\n\n**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which do impact the complex way in which we store memories. \\*More movement disorders come with the old ones.\n\n**Second Generation: (new, atypical):** Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors**.** Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.\n\nWhat do they all have in common? **They impact Dopamine.** Long story short; A delicate balance of Dopamine is needed for memory to function. Since this class targets Dopamine, it's fair to say it has the potential to alter our memory. Whether that's a good or bad thing is specific to the patient, but it's typically an unwelcome effect.\n\n# \n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Antihistamines\n\n**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom,\u00a0 hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan,\u00a0 triprolidine, triafed**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different 'generations' & target different histamine receptors in our body.\n\n* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body\n* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion\n* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System\n* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nWe're actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that **anti-**histamines are usually anticholinergic; **blocking** receptors for choline. The problem is that we need choline to be readily available to have the ability to learn, understand and remember.\n\n### Why it Impacts Memory?\n\nBeing that antihistamines are often anticholinergic, they do impair our ability to think, learn and remember. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain. We already naturally produce less acetylcholine overtime. This is partly why as we age our ability to remember, think, and learn diminishes. It's widely known that anticholinergics impact memory, thinking, learning, and muscle function. It is also suggested that these drugs increase the risk of developing dementia.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways in addition to the reason why it's administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much less specific in their effects, they are affiliated with greater memory impairment. Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings.\n\n### Summary\n\nOverall, the effects range. Regarding mental health specifically; Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax are commonly prescribed for anxiety. While your risks are much less severe than benzodiazepines, these are FIRST generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this is also means they do impair our ability to remember.\n\nAn example of second generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won't do you much good.\n\nHope this helps clarify some of the impacts of memory and mental health medications. Leave a comment if there is a drug you're still wondering about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the link again for original post below. \n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)",

        "text": "Hi all, thanks in advance for any thoughts/input.\n\nMy brother recently got home from the hospital, where they 2.5x'd his clozapine dose and added 15mg/day of oral fluphenazine to help his months'-long psychosis. His regular prescriber is slowly tapering him down but it's gonna take a long time. On his usual lower dose of clozapine he's very active physically and mentally, but now he has zero motivation to do anything, and he has some pressing things to get done within the next few months. He strikes me as being totally sedated, depressed even.  Just zero drive, irritable, tired, defeated...\n\nHe doesn't want to be prescribed anything to help with motivation (like a low dose of a stimulant) bc he doesn't want to be overly medicated.\n\nI struggle with ADHD/depression myself (the other end of the dopamine spectrum lol) and have been unmedicated for a while, and I was trying to think of OTC things I've used, to help him. Caffeine, nicotine, nootropics like aniracetam, heck even a diet pill could help him, matcha. But it's like he doesn't even have the motivation to do that. It's like his brain has turned defeatist.\n\nIt's heartbreaking bc distance running has always brought him joy and helped him manage his mental health but he can barely get out of bed. I'm kind of pushing him to try chemical interventions to just give him the push to restart the running, then once he's able to do that regularly again it will help with the dopamines and he'll feel better. Unfortunately that takes time, just like the taper will, and he's stuck right now but he can't afford to be.\n\nDoes anyone have any tricks? He generally eats healthy and takes vitamins. Anything non-chemical to light the fire under him?\n\nI feel for all of you who take these drugs despite their side effects. A pharmaceutically-induced depression.  He already survived all the Parkinson's side effects from years of Haldol. His psychosis is gone but so is his quality of life. I know it will even out eventually, and so does he. He's being patient but my heart hurts for him. Would appreciate any ideas. <3",

I refer to them as \"headmates.\" I used to refer to them as \"tulpas,\" but I had a rough experience where I believed them to be real and they became evil a few months back during a psychotic episode (I was off medication because I'd gone inpatient, and my insurance refused to pay for the medication upon leaving the hospital.)\n\nI'm currently on 10 mg of fluphenazine, just upped from 5 mg literally today to help with my negative voices since my voices respond to medication. I'm seeking a therapist who specializes in schizophrenia to help me. My psychiatrist is not worried about the good voices at all. \n\nI'll go ahead and post mine. \n\nSince coming back from the episode, life has resumed from me from where it left off. I was smoking cannabis to further the hallucinations and help my \"tulpas\" along, but because of my experience with psychosis (even though I know it probably was because of my lack of medication), I do not want to consume it anymore. We have deep interpersonal relationships. They're able to come through me like those experiencing DID. We talk daily, have conversations, play video games together, cuddle, kiss, and all kinds of stuff together. I get tactile hallucinations, so they pair up nicely with my auditory. I even get tickled! It's fun when it's positive, but I need medication to make it positive. \n\nIt has been a blessing for me to have this because I do not experience the depression associated with this disorder. Most of my anhedonia is cured, too, because they constantly want to do things with me (go on dates/outings, play video games, cuddle, etc.)\n\nI just wanna hear others' experiences with this. I hope I'm not alone. I've asked this question before a few years back when I first started my journey with the Hearing Voices Network, and I got interesting responses. I thought I'd ask again! ",

Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. **Role of Dopamine in Consciousness**: Studies with dopamine-deficient mice suggest that dopamine signaling is crucial for the expression of consciousness. Dopamine-deficient mice exhibit deficits in attention, learning, memory, and motivation, despite being awake and responsive to stimuli. Restoration of dopamine signaling restores most behaviors, indicating the importance of dopamine in maintaining consciousness.\n2. **Association Between Dopamine and Spirituality**: The paper discusses the relationship between dopamine and spiritual experiences, particularly during meditation. PET studies show a significant increase in dopamine release during meditation practices such as Yoga Nidra. This suggests that dopamine plays a role in the neurochemical processes underlying spiritual practices and experiences.\n3. **Impact of Dopamine on Religiosity**: There is a proposed link between dopamine function, specifically within the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), and religiosity. Hypoactivity of the medial PFC may result in decreased religiosity, characterized by reckless behavior, self-indulgence, and impaired theory of mind. Conversely, hyperactivity of the medial PFC may lead to heightened religiosity, marked by rigid conformity, excessive self-concern, and overinterpretation of others' thoughts.\n4. **Potential Psychotic Effects of Dopamine Modulation**: The paper suggests that dopamine modulation, along with other neurochemical changes induced by meditation, can lead to psychotic states. Increased dopamine, along with other neurotransmitters like serotonin and DMT, may contribute to schizophrenomimetic effects and psychotic-like experiences during meditation.\n\nIn summary, the evidence presented supports the idea that dopamine levels can influence self-awareness, conscious experience, and spirituality. Changes in dopamine function may impact cognitive processes, emotional regulation, and perception, ultimately affecting one's sense of self and spiritual experiences.  \n\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nReference:  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4737196/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4737196/)\n\n>  \nDopamine improved the prediction by subjective awareness of objective  performance in an online task with minimal self\u2010awareness (noetic  metacognition). Dopamine also enhanced extended self\u2010awareness with  introspection (autonoetic metacognition) concomitant with stimulation of  the anterior cingulate/prefrontal cortex, a process which seems to be  tightly linked to incentive stimulation and reward\n\n  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839810/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839810/)\n\n>  \nThe neural correlates of consciousness are largely unknown but many neural circuits are likely to be involved. Our experiments with mice  that cannot synthesize dopamine suggest that dopamine signaling is a  critical component necessary for the expression of consciousness.  Although dopamine-deficient mice are awake and respond to many stimuli,  they are unmotivated and have profound deficits in all but the simplest  learning tasks. Dopamine-deficient mice are unable to attend to salient  sensory information, integrate it with prior experience, store it in  long-term memory, or choose appropriate actions. While clearly conscious  from a general anesthetic point of view, dopamine-deficient mice have  marginal arousal and appear to be virtually unconscious from a  behavioral point of view. Restoration of dopamine signaling within the  striatum by viral gene therapy strategies restores most behaviors.  Therefore, I propose that dopaminergic modulation of glutamatergic  inputs from the cortex and thalamus onto medium spiny neurons in the  striatum contributes to cognition and the expression of consciousness.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190564/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190564/)\n\n>  \nThe role of spirituality as a resource for finding meaning and hope in suffering has also been identified as a key component in the process of psychological recovery. Most studies have shown that religious  involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes,  including greater longevity, coping skills and health-related quality  of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression and  suicide  \n\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>A study conducted on students in a large metropolitan area showed that  religious factors were strongly associated with lower drug abuse, even  after controlling for the relevant socio-demographic and educational  variables.  The role of spirituality in addiction was also reflected upon in a  study, which found that smoking and frequent binge drinking were  negatively correlated with spirituality scores  \n\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Most of the studies examining them used functional imaging as the  investigation tool, to delineate the neural mechanisms involved in these  practices. They include the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies  on Yoga, Tantric Yoga and Yoga Nidra; the Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (MRI) study on Kundalini Yoga; and the Single Photon Emission  Computerized Tomography (SPECT) study on Tibetan meditation. The studies  point to prefrontal activation, transient hypofrontality, increased  frontal lobe and decreased parietal lobe activity and also to a  deafferentation of the posterior superior parietal lobule (PSPL) in  spirituality  \n\\[...\\]  \nThere is substantial evidence from the psychology of religion to  suggest that people are prepared \u2018for religious experiences and this  readiness\u2019 is probably mediated by the dorsomedial frontal cortex,  leading to the commonly reported felt immediacy of religious experience.  The experience, however, becomes religious when people consciously  identify the experience as consistent with their own religious schema.  This cognitive process most probably involves the dorsolateral,  prefrontal and medial parietal cortex. Therefore, the prefrontal regions  mediate both the preparedness of religious experience and conscious  cognitive process involved in the appreciation of religious experience  \n\\[...\\]  \nFurther, it is proposed that a balanced function of the medial PFC is  needed to maintain balanced religious activities. The specific functions  involved in this regulation of religion are those mediating compliance  to rules and customs, self-reflection and the understanding of thoughts  and feelings of others with compassion and empathy (theory of mind).  Theory of mind (ToM) or mentalization is the ability to recognize that  someone else has a mind different from one's own. It involves the  ability to infer someone else's mind by facial expression, tone of voice  and non-verbal communication.  \n\\[...\\]  \nThe medial PFC is involved in error detection and monitoring and  compliance to social norms and therefore is involved in mediating  compliance to rules and customs. The medial PFC along with the posterior  cingulate is involved in self-reflective thought and this helps the  person to have an insight into his own experience and the perception of  self in relation to the divine being. The third regulatory function,  which includes the theory of mind, involves the medial PFC, especially  the orbitofrontal cortex, the lesion of which impairs theory of mind  tasks. Based on this it is hypothesized that the hypofunction of the  medial PFC results in decreased religiosity (hyporeligiosity). This  would result from a combination of reckless and lawless behaviour  (impaired error detection), self-indulgence (loss of self reflection)  and an inability to consider the thoughts of others (impaired theory of  mind). Hyperfunction of the medial PFC, on the other hand, will lead to  rigid conformity with rules and customs, excessive concern over oneself  and one's existence and excessive interpretation of the mind of others,  all of which results in heightened religiosity (hyperreligiosity)  \n\\[...\\]  \nThe dopaminergic system, via the basal ganglia, is involved in cortical  subcortical interactions and a PET study on the dopaminergic tone in  Yoga Nidra using 11 C-raclopride showed significant increase of dopamine  during meditation.  During meditation, 11C-raclopride binding in ventral striatum decreased  by 7.9%. This corresponds to a 65% increase in endogenous dopamine  release  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \nMeditation can induce psychotic states via mechanism such as increased 5HT2  receptor activation, increased DMT, increased NAAG and increased  dopamine. The mechanisms include the 5HT inhibition of LGB, the  hallucinogenic effects of DMT, the dissociative hallucinogenic effects  of NAAG and the action of increased dopamine in the temporal lobe. A  variety of schizophrenomimetic effects can be seen as a result of these  complex neurochemical changes.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've posted here a few times, but seeing intro posts makes it sound like something I should do. I'm a 27 year-old man was diagnosed with autism at a very young age, but struggled through college with undiagnosed (and unsuspected) ADHD. I wound up in a few fringe internet communities and believed myself to have a romantic relationship with a fictional woman, which really should have been a sign that something was wrong in my head. But eventually the hallucinations started, and even worse delusions. I came close to a violent episode at one point, but I was able to calm myself down. I remember one night after seeing a dot dance in the center of my field of view, the clearest sign at that point that my senses were failing. I was crying my eyes out texting one of my friends because I didn't know what to do. I thought antipsychotics would turn me into a pill zombie without a life worth living.\n\nFortunately, though, I found an independent psychiatrist who truly had my best interests in mind. The 20mg of olanzapine I started taking all but eliminated my positive symptoms. There's been hardly any side effects either, and I'm able to hold down a job no problem. I had a scare a few months ago when that stopped working (I think because I started taking a different brand of the generic), but my new psychiatrist put me on fluphenazine and that's worked wonderfully. This episode has left me fearful that one day that'll stop working too, and I'll eventually have to give up my job just to stay sane. But in any case, I have what I have now, and I do my best to be grateful.\n\nI hope you, too, find some success in your life. I've seen both here and in other places how hard it can be to just open your eyes every morning. Part of me wants to take some sort of proper counseling training just to contribute in a meaningful way.",

        "text": "Memory loss is a common topic within the mental health world. I'm an RN that works in Mental Health & going to do my best to summarize some research on *which* mental health medications impact our memory and *why* they do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will Include the link to the original post that is probably easier to follow but also going to include all the info below.\n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs**\n\n**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**\n\nDrug class\n\nThis is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain. Over 10% of the US takes an SSRI.\n\nWhat Do SSRIs Do?\n\nWhat does every medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, you\u2019re blocking the neurons from reabsorbing Serotonin, meaning there is more Serotonin available.\n\nSo what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nSerotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. While we can measure the levels in our blood we cannot measure the levels within our brain. Meaning we\u2019re all in the dark as to how much is within our brain and whether or not it\u2019s even correlated to the amount in our blood.\n\nHow SSRIs Impact Memory\n\nAge and gender do not seem to influence the data that SSRIs are correlated with memory effects. Something that is important to mention, is that while research has shown that SSRIs are *correlated* with memory loss, that doesn\u2019t exactly mean that they CAUSE it. Correlation and cause are two different things. Many people that take SSRIs also take benzodiazepines, drink, smoke, have genetic predisposition to memory loss, etc. Depression and anxiety themselves can even cause memory problems.\n\nSummary\n\nSo, after reading through many articles, there overall wasn\u2019t enough credible information to emphatically say that an SSRI causes memory loss. In fact, I came across more research that suggested SSRIs improve cognitive performance and memory. Some data also specifically supported that SSRI\u2019s can improve memory for patients experiencing psychosis and depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tricyclic Antidepressant\u00a0 | TCAs**\n\n**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThe word \u201ctricyclic\u201d refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed before SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays. TCAs are still often administered for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.\n\nWhat do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?\n\nWhat do all TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors. These key differences create a cascade of effects in the body that do impact memory. These key differences are also the culprit for the common side effects in this drug class like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nIn 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 ( a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new 'invention' was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.\n\nHow TCAs Impact Memory\n\nThere are multiple reasons why a TCA impacts our memory. **The first reason** is that we retain memory best when norepinephrine is released at an optimal rate. These drugs block the reabsorption of norepinephrine; which is known to be a moderator of memory. With too much of it, we are anxious and stressed, too little of it and we are drowsy and not as coherent. Either way, the drug has an impact on norepinephrine which directly influences how we store memory.\n\n**The second reason** why this drug class impacts memory is because it competes with our natural antagonists on muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is well documented that these drugs block muscarinic receptors (which is an acetylcholine receptor), and acetylcholine directly impacts learning and memory.\n\n>*\u201cMuscarinic*\u00a0acetylcholine\u00a0*receptors* in the hippocampus and cortex underlie\u00a0*memory*\u00a0formation\u201d\n\nSummary\n\nSo, TCAs are a drug that research has linked with memory impairments and dementia. These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life (even could improve memory if their extreme anxiety was impairing it), while for another it can make them drowsy and leave a bad impression.\n\n\\*Note each drug within the class impacts the degree of these effects a little differently.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling like doing a deep dive into some of the articles I read to gain clarity, by all means, click the links below!\n\n[Differential Cognitive Actions of Norepinephrine \u03b12 and \u03b11 Receptor Signaling in the Prefrontal Cortex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4876052/)\n\n[The effect of tricyclic antidepressants on cholinergic responses of single cortical neurones.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1666268/?page=7)\n\n[A brief history of antidepressant drug development: from tricyclics to beyond ketamine](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-neuropsychiatrica/article/brief-history-of-antidepressant-drug-development-from-tricyclics-to-beyond-ketamine/B5C9D55C6299BC41B237187DB609DB68)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Benzodiazepines**\n\n**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThese are commonly considered anti-anxiety medication (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.\n\nLet\u2019s taco \u2018bout it.\n\nThis drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which slows down our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).\n\nDid You Know?\n\nAnesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?\n\nHow Benzodiazepines Impact Memory\n\nThis drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is advantageously quick acting, the effects linger.\u00a0 Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.\n\nThis is why a rehab center isn\u2019t going to allow the use of 'said drug' while \u2018recovering\u2019. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking 'said drug' while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning & you're not able to remember anything, how can you work on it? The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.\n\nNow, don't shoot the messenger. Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They're an actual life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with *repeated* use we will need *increasingly* higher doses, making the dent in your memory more and more indisputable.\n\nFull Disclosure\n\nMy mother was an addict, benzodiazepines being her drug of choice.\n\nDo you know an addict whose drug of choice is a benzodiazepine? No SHAME, but if so, you can probably attest that **they don\u2019t remember shit.** \n\nHow about an addict whose drug of choice is alcohol? All love here, but you can say for certain, *they don\u2019t remember shit*.\n\nThere has even been a fair amount of data to support that the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s is elevated in those taking the drug for over 6 months. One Harvard study even speculated that it would raise the risk by 84%! Seems unrealistic, but who am I to question Harvard; I'll add the link below if you're also feeling speculative.\n\nAnother point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.\n\nThis is often what is referred to as *\u201crebound anxiety\u201d*\u00a0 because your anxiety is likely to get worse, before it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken long term.\n\nTake it from a nurse who works in mental health; it's not enjoyable being the bystander of a patient trying to escape their benzo addiction.\n\nBut this is why the mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time.\n\nNow, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please don\u2019t go flush yours down the toilet after reading this.\n\nWhen Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is that we\u2019re now in a benzo addiction crisis. We\u2019re learning over time, as a society and those changes don\u2019t happen overnight. And trust me, as a mental health professional I myself occasionally grow infuriated at the amount of family doctors who prescribe copious amounts of benzodiazepines only to later turn the patient away after addiction has crippled them.\n\n[Harvard Article Claims Benzodiazepine use may raise risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/benzodiazepine-use-may-raise-risk-alzheimers-disease-201409107397#:~:text=People%20who%20had%20taken%20a%20benzodiazepine%20for%20three,84%25.%20The%20type%20of%20drug%20taken%20also%20mattered.)\n\n>\u201cRight now I\u2019m having amnesia and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at the same time.

This drug class actually encompasses three different major classes\n\n1. Blocking Sodium Channels\n2. Enhancement of GABA Inhibition\n3. Regulation of Synaptic Releases\n\nWhy it Impacts Memory\n\nOverall, anticonvulsants work in different ways; trust me I rode the magic school for HOURS trying to gain an understanding of them to write this. Truthfully, we still have a lot to learn about them. Their impact is complicated and the effects range based on the dose and drug.\n\nFor instance, Topamax has pretty diverse pharmacologic actions, because of that, it **has** been linked with impaired concentration, cognitive dulling, psychomotor retardation, language and comprehension difficulties, rather extreme effects on short-term memory and working memory, poor verbal fluency and word-finding, reduced IQ scores, abnormal thinking and delayed cognitive speed. Because of this dark cloud of side effects, Topamax is sometimes referred to as 'Dope-A-Max'.\n\nHowever, a more selective medication within the drug class such as Phenytoin or Tegretol are more specific to blocking sodium channels. Overall, they seem to have less impact on memory and cognitive function.\n\nMany of these drugs listed above have an impact on GABA, and long term exposure to GABA agents can alter the functionality of GABA permanently, which means there are potentially permanent consequences to cognition, behaviors, and memory.\n\nPhenobarbital has been linked to lower IQ, and worse effects than Depakote and Tegretol, however it is actually a barbituate. It\u2019s effects are similar to benzodiazepines which you can read more about above.\n\nGabapentin, used for seizures and often mood disorders, belongs to it's own drug class. Still, it **has** been linked to memory impairment. Hence, the name, it also impacts GABA, which as mentioned several times now, certainly plays a hand in our ability to remember. At this point there isn\u2019t enough research to say it\u2019s linked to dementia though.\n\nAs far as drugs for epilepsy, Gabapentin is tolerated much better than many others. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that this drug seems to have more *short term* effects on memory. Some will experience a disorienting feeling or short term memory loss while taking Gabapentin, but the reports of long term memory being impacted are reported less often.\n\n[Long Term Effects of Gabapentin](https://deserthopetreatment.com/sedatives/gabapentin-addiction/long-term-side-effects/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Antipsychotics**\n\n**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics; risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome & Huntington's disease\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nMost drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nOddly enough, memory seems to actually be improved when using an antipsychotic for a person with psychotic symptoms, though there are many that take medications within this class that are not psychotic. So let's talk about that more.\n\nWhy It Impacts Memory\n\nFirst, let's skip back to the purpose of these drugs. Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it's to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.\n\nThis class is broken up into two categories;\n\n**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which do impact the complex way in which we store memories. \\*More movement disorders come with the old ones.\n\n**Second Generation: (new, atypical):** Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors\\*\\*.\\*\\* Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.\n\nWhat do they all have in common? **They impact Dopamine.** Long story short; A delicate balance of Dopamine is needed for memory to function. Since this class targets Dopamine, it's fair to say it has the potential to alter our memory. Whether that's a good or bad thing is specific to the patient, but it's typically an unwelcome effect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Antihistamines**\n\n**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom,\u00a0 hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan,\u00a0 triprolidine, triafed**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different 'generations' & target different histamine receptors in our body.\n\n* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body\n* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion\n* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System\n* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nWe're actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that \\*\\*anti-\\*\\*histamines are usually anticholinergic; **blocking** receptors for choline. The problem is that we need choline to be readily available to have the ability to learn, understand and remember.\n\nWhy it Impacts Memory?\n\nBeing that antihistamines are often anticholinergic, they do impair our ability to think, learn and remember. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain. We already naturally produce less acetylcholine overtime. This is partly why as we age our ability to remember, think, and learn diminishes. It's widely known that anticholinergics impact memory, thinking, learning, and muscle function. It is also suggested that these drugs increase the risk of developing dementia.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways in addition to the reason why it's administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much less specific in their effects, they are affiliated with greater memory impairment. Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, the effects range. Regarding mental health specifically; Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax are commonly prescribed for anxiety. While your risks are much less severe than benzodiazepines, these are FIRST generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this is also means they do impair our ability to remember.\n\nAn example of second generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won't do you much good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the link again for original post below.\n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)",

This doesn't happen when I close my eyes and I just have \"blank\" vision. Typically, I get \"phosphene vision\" when I'm anxious or getting to that point. Now this wouldn't be too much of an issue except that I have an anxiety disorder where I get my stress response triggered by visual stimuli (as well as by some auditory and somatic stimuli) such as by bright-ish lights, reflections, or noticing a peculiar \"black tint\" to my vision, possibly mild visual snow (I don't actually have visual snow. I'm just hypothesizing). When I get triggered, I go into an anxiety episode where the smallest of sensations can heighten my anxiety. I attempt to remedy this by going into my room which has been made to be pitch black, lie down, and close my eyes, except that I notice the phosphenes even more when I'm anxious, and my eyes twitch open sooner. With open eyes, I still freak out over the phosphenes I see in the pitch blackness. So it's a struggle to repeatedly close my eyes and manipulate my vision until it goes blank on its own and I no longer notice the phosphenes. Now I'm not asking about all that. All I want to know if there's some way or trick to have my vision go blank on a whim when I notice the phosphenes, or else some way to make the phosphenes go away, or otherwise is there a way to prevent the twitching open of my eyes?

        "text": "My daughter (18F, 5'7\", 220 lb, Caucasian) has profound intellectual disability (verbal and self-care skills at around the 4-5 year old level), anxiety/OCD, and severe Tourettes (90+ YGTSS).  Her primary tics involve screams at up to 115 decibels, along with head jerks.  She has other, more minor tics both vocal (grunts and short words) and physical (stereotyped hand and arm movements, jumping, pressure, pulling, and very occasionally striking herself on the forehead with her fist).\n\nAs is usual for Tourettes, the tics rotate in and out, but the screams are pretty constant and make it so she can't go to school or really do anything out of the house.  They are very upsetting to her and to our family, and leave her almost completely impaired/disabled.\n\nTo address the Tourettes and anxiety/OCD she has been taking a number of meds over the years.\n\nUp until early 2019, she was taking guanfacine 50mg BID, fluvoxamine 50mg BID, and trazodone 50mg QD.  Anxiety and OCD was well-controlled at that point but tics had become very severe and self-injurious, so we added in topiramate 100mg BID and aripiprazole 10mg QD shortly thereafter.  Immediately after starting the aripiprazole, the tics improved tremendously. During the latter half of 2019 and all of 2020, she had an average of less than 1 screaming tic per day, and her lesser physical and verbal tics reduced greatly as well.\n\nTowards December of 2020, the screaming tics slowly started to increase.  We increased aripiprazole to 15mg QD and then to 20mg QD with no significant effect.  At that point we switched away from aripiprazole to risperidone for a few months, which maybe helped a bit but didn't have a strong effect.  Recently we transitioned from risperidone to fluphenazine.  This appeared to help some but caused sleep disruption, so we replaced the evening fluphenazine with quetiapine and increased to trazodone 100mg QD.\n\nAt that time, she was having somewhere between 80 and 100 screaming tics per day and was very sedated, sleeping approximately 16 hours per day.\n\nAt that point our doctor suggested trying pregabalin, which had been effective for another patient of his with severe tics.  We gave it a shot, replacing the morning fluphenazine with 50 mg pregabalin QD, due to concerns about oversedation.  The second day on the medication, she was up and active the whole day, sleeping 7-8 hours that night.  A few days later we increased to pregabalin 50 mg BID, which caused her to only sleep for 4 hours.  We backed back down to 50 mg QD and she went back to 7-8 hours of sleep.  However, tics did not seem to improve at all and were becoming more self-injurious.\n\nWe spoke to the doctor again and removed the pregabalin and reinstated fluphenzaine.  She also had an ear infection at that time that we treated with amoxicillin.  However, after the meds reversal and the course of amoxicillin she did not return to her previous status.  Instead of sleeping 16 hours per day she seems to have stabilized at 10 (8 at night with a 2 hour nap in the afternoon).  And instead of 80-100 screaming tics per day she's now at 500-600 (!!!).\n\nMostly in desperation, we then added in aripiprazole 5 mg QD, then upped it to 10 mg QD, then to 15 mg QD, in the hopes that it would work the way it did previously.  It seems to not have any significant effect this time around.\n\nShe is currently taking (deep breath) guanfacine 2 mg BID, fluvoxamine 50 mg BID, topiramate 75 mg BID, fluphenazine 5 mg QD, aripiprazole 15 mg QD, quetiapine 100 mg QD, and trazodone 100 mg QD.\n\nThe screaming tics seem to ramp up into major attacks of 50-150 several times per day about 2-3 hours apart, then subside, but there are smaller bursts at other times.\n\nWe are completely lost at this point and I suspect our doctor is as well.  She's on a huge number of meds and I suspect many (most?  all?) aren't helping her or are actively making the situation worse, but her situation is so extreme that we're terrified to take anything out of the rotation for fear it will make it worse.\n\nWe know there are other therapy options for tics that are resistant to treatment with medication, but we don't know how to get started with something like DBS, etc.  Our current provider doesn't offer that as a treatment, and I don't know if someone with her other disabilities is a candidate.\n\nSo I guess I'm asking for any advice as to how to best deal with refractory tics, where we might go for more answers, and any suggestions as to what we might do differently with her medication regimen.  If you have a silver bullet, shoot me please.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

I live in South Africa, and at this point I don't know what to do with my life. \n\nThis started way before the pandemic. 3,4 years ago? i'm not sure anymore.\n\nI've been asked to do an unimaginable amount of tests (blood work, EMG, sleep study). And paid a lot as well of courses, at the end, i've asked to eat healthy, exercise, man up (dismissed in short).\n\nMy symptoms are several, they are cyclic. I get a symptom, then in the same day, another one, or the next day, it depends, i mean they're cyclic? but without any specific order,  i have no clue what triggers a specific symptom.\n\nI sleep for 10 to 13 hours, struggle to get out of bed, and feel very unwell if i have my alarm set at 7 or 8 am. I wake up usually around 11 or 12 or 1 pm. then the next couple of hours, i lay in bed till i get better: i  have a sort of temperature-like feeling in my head, and the rest of my body feels paralyzed and heavy, so i can't do much apart from scroll anything that doesn't require effort.\n\nwhen this awful symptom is gone (no, it's not burning, nor burning or tingling in the skin). \n\nI feel tired, or just feeling unwell, sick, fluish.\n\nThe tiredness has several forms: feeling weak, sitting and talking is a task that is very difficult. Cooking etc basic tasks are really tough.\n\nCognitive functions are declined as well. I eat healthy, I have a healthy weight, I have never touched any drug, I have zero addiction, I don't have OCD, nor BPD, nor schizophrenia. Literally those are my \"only\" issues, but very debilitating. Surely i tried the healthy bla bla (exercise rest vitamins vitamin D). I've been on vacations away, same. I've been told it must be psychological, tried therapy, tried psychiatry... my doctors were always hesitant,unsure,reluctant to diagnoze, telling me i'm not doing or trying hard enough, telling me it's in my head. i literally do the strict minimum now, not because i want to, but because i CAN't. i stopped any commitment (dating or part time job) because of these symptoms.\n\nI am 20 but I feel 80, and a sick 80 years old.\n\nlist of medications i tried:\n\n\\-vitamins like ginseng, vitamin c, magesium, vitamin D and B, omega 3 and 6\n\n\\-lexapro, duloxetine, valenfaxine, and sometimes combinations, i don't remember exactly (i am tired and unwell to the extent remembering things is so daunting lol), olanzapine, xanax, deanxit,  fluphenazine, paxil CR\n\nIf you can help, or suggest, It would mean the world.\n\nthank you.",

        "text": "34, Male, 6 foot 2, 227 pounds, caucasian, 1 week duration, pain in back, no known physical ailments, fluphenazine 1.25 mg artane 5 mg gabapentin 1800 mg, no recreational drugs, former smoker on nicotine replacement.\n\n My question is regarding consistent back (kidney?) pain after drinking protein shakes. This occurs with both casein and whey protein. I've been drinking them for a week and had a constant dull pain in the middle left and middle right sides of my back. This faded today as I haven't had any of them. I went as low as 1/2 the recommended dose of protein but it continued to happen.\n\nIs it then unsafe for me to continue drinking them? Polycystic kidney disease runs in the family though I don't think I have it as they didn't mention finding that at the ER when I had medication induced kidney stones about 5 years ago (I no longer take that medication). I don't know which it was, but I had either a cat scan or mri done and no mention of cysts.  I am 34 so I think signs of the disease would have shown up by now.  Is it a sign that my kidneys are weak for some reason?  What could it be?\n\nThank you for reading.",

I'll just talk to myself about what I did today and what I'm going to do tomorrow. Any attempts I make to stop it are usually in vain, as I'll just keep talking a few seconds later. I'm sure i sound like a madman at this point.\n\nMy other conditions that might be contributing to this: Depression, Anxiety, Obesity, Tourette Syndrome.\n\nI come to you for advice because my father insists that no doctor would prescribe me a sleep aid considering I am so young.
